getline is just as fast as fgets and let's you get a string of
arbitrarily large length

you can use recursion as long as you use >= -O2 optimization
otherwise no TCO

my singly-linked-list performed the same (maybe better) as glib's
singly-linked list when optimized (but it was much slower when it was not)

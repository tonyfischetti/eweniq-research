Oh, do it now, oh, do it now
Yeah, we celebrate diversity in the university
Everybody can't be a queen, everybody can't be a ho and a bitch (Ha ha)
Everybody can't b e a philosopher
Some of y'all gotta load up the clip
Word up, watch this
It goes 1, 2, 3 we the best
Knowledge Reigns Supreme, as you can see, or KRS
You don't wanna test the team, why get a vest
You don't wanna be cursed in a verse, by the blessed
KRS with the sound for the east and the west
Follow no, follow no, follow no, follow no beast on a quest
Somebody gotta
be fresh
be whack
be the emcee
do the rap
be smart
do that
do art
be black
have heart
be white
do their part
be bright
be up
be down
be the teacher
be the clown
be lost
be found
be in the economy making the money go round
be the president
get down
be hesitant
be relevant
be celibate
be having their sex in a lex for the hell of it
be intelligent
be illiterate
go all the way
go a little bit
be an idiot
be belligerent
be hip hop
Cause somebody else is living it
be spitting it
be ignorant
be holy
But somebody gotta have sin in it
be losing it
be winning it
be flippin' the style I'm kicking just a little bit
be into it
be out of it
be up for it
be doubtin' it
be running it
be all that
Somebody don't even know that
come right here
Somebody else gotta go back
be scheming
be a witness
be seeing in the meaning is different
Somebody else gotta be somebody, for some else to be somebody
Somebody else to run into to wealth, to try to create one body
One aim, one God, one destiny
I'm not non-violent, you can back up off of me
I sip my tea, and cock back three
One for Tiny Tim, Mr. Walt, and Evil Dee
I hope you all see, the need for unity
I'll never stop speaking about Marcus Garvey
Kwame Ture or Malcolm X all day
Black leadership today is all play
Y'all play, y'all immature black behavior
Is worse than being a traitor
Do on to others, as you would have done do to your neighbor
Big up to my philosophy majors
Free Mumia Abu-Jamal from the cages
We writes the pages and teach all ages
Justice, tell me what we want now
Justice, for Mumia Abu-Jamal
Or justice for Amado Dialo
Justice, there is no peace without (*Justice*)
All dem mercy, now watch this

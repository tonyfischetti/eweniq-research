chapter
i
i
was
born
in
tuckahoe
near
hillsborough
and
about
twelve
miles
from
easton
in
talbot
county
maryland
i
have
no
accurate
knowledge
of
my
age
never
having
seen
any
authentic
record
containing
it
by
far
the
larger
part
of
the
slaves
know
as
little
of
their
ages
as
horses
know
of
theirs
and
it
is
the
wish
of
most
masters
within
my
knowledge
to
keep
their
slaves
thus
ignorant
i
do
not
remember
to
have
ever
met
a
slave
who
could
tell
of
his
birthday
they
seldom
come
nearer
to
it
than
plantingtime
harvesttime
cherrytime
springtime
or
falltime
a
want
of
information
concerning
my
own
was
a
source
of
unhappiness
to
me
even
during
childhood
the
white
children
could
tell
their
ages
i
could
not
tell
why
i
ought
to
be
deprived
of
the
same
privilege
i
was
not
allowed
to
make
any
inquiries
of
my
master
concerning
it
he
deemed
all
such
inquiries
on
the
part
of
a
slave
improper
and
impertinent
and
evidence
of
a
restless
spirit
the
nearest
estimate
i
can
give
makes
me
now
between
twenty
seven
and
twentyeight
years
of
age
i
come
to
this
from
hearing
my
master
say
some
time
during

i
was
about
seventeen
years
old
my
mother
was
named
harriet
bailey
she
was
the
daughter
of
isaac
and
betsey
bailey
both
colored
and
quite
dark
my
mother
was
of
a
darker
complexion
than
either
my
grandmother
or
grandfather
my
father
was
a
white
man
he
was
admitted
to
be
such
by
all
i
ever
heard
speak
of
my
parentage
the
opinion
was
also
whispered
that
my
master
was
my
father
but
of
the
correctness
of
this
opinion
i
know
nothing
the
means
of
knowing
was
withheld
from
me
my
mother
and
i
were
separated
when
i
was
but
an
infantbefore
i
knew
her
as
my
mother
it
is
a
common
custom
in
the
part
of
maryland
from
which
i
ran
away
to
part
children
from
their
mothers
at
a
very
early
age
frequently
before
the
child
has
reached
its
twelfth
month
its
mother
is
taken
from
it
and
hired
out
on
some
farm
a
considerable
distance
off
and
the
child
is
placed
under
the
care
of
an
old
woman
too
old
for
field
labor
for
what
this
separation
is
done
i
do
not
know
unless
it
be
to
hinder
the
development
of
the
childs
affection
toward
its
mother
and
to
blunt
and
destroy
the
natural
affection
of
the
mother
for
the
child
this
is
the
inevitable
result
i
never
saw
my
mother
to
know
her
as
such
more
than
four
or
five
times
in
my
life
and
each
of
these
times
was
very
short
in
duration
and
at
night
she
was
hired
by
a
mr
stewart
who
lived
about
twelve
miles
from
my
home
she
made
her
journeys
to
see
me
in
the
night
travelling
the
whole
distance
on
foot
after
the
performance
of
her
days
work
she
was
a
field
hand
and
a
whipping
is
the
penalty
of
not
being
in
the
field
at
sunrise
unless
a
slave
has
special
permission
from
his
or
her
master
to
the
contrarya
permission
which
they
seldom
get
and
one
that
gives
to
him
that
gives
it
the
proud
name
of
being
a
kind
master
i
do
not
recollect
of
ever
seeing
my
mother
by
the
light
of
day
she
was
with
me
in
the
night
she
would
lie
down
with
me
and
get
me
to
sleep
but
long
before
i
waked
she
was
gone
very
little
communication
ever
took
place
between
us
death
soon
ended
what
little
we
could
have
while
she
lived
and
with
it
her
hardships
and
suffering
she
died
when
i
was
about
seven
years
old
on
one
of
my
masters
farms
near
lees
mill
i
was
not
allowed
to
be
present

during
her
illness
at
her
death
or
burial
she
was
gone
long
before
i
knew
any
thing
about
it
never
having
enjoyed
to
any
considerable
extent
her
soothing
presence
her
tender
and
watchful
care
i
received
the
tidings
of
her
death
with
much
the
same
emotions
i
should
have
probably
felt
at
the
death
of
a
stranger
called
thus
suddenly
away
she
left
me
without
the
slightest
intimation
of
who
my
father
was
the
whisper
that
my
master
was
my
father
may
or
may
not
be
true
and
true
or
false
it
is
of
but
little
consequence
to
my
purpose
whilst
the
fact
remains
in
all
its
glaring
odiousness
that
slaveholders
have
ordained
and
by
law
established
that
the
children
of
slave
women
shall
in
all
cases
follow
the
condition
of
their
mothers
and
this
is
done
too
obviously
to
administer
to
their
own
lusts
and
make
a
gratification
of
their
wicked
desires
profitable
as
well
as
pleasurable
for
by
this
cunning
arrangement
the
slaveholder
in
cases
not
a
few
sustains
to
his
slaves
the
double
relation
of
master
and
father
i
know
of
such
cases
and
it
is
worthy
of
remark
that
such
slaves
invariably
suffer
greater
hardships
and
have
more
to
contend
with
than
others
they
are
in
the
first
place
a
constant
offence
to
their
mistress
she
is
ever
disposed
to
find
fault
with
them
they
can
seldom
do
any
thing
to
please
her
she
is
never
better
pleased
than
when
she
sees
them
under
the
lash
especially
when
she
suspects
her
husband
of
showing
to
his
mulatto
children
favors
which
he
withholds
from
his
black
slaves
the
master
is
frequently
compelled
to
sell
this
class
of
his
slaves
out
of
deference
to
the
feelings
of
his
white
wife
and
cruel
as
the
deed
may
strike
any
one
to
be
for
a
man
to
sell
his
own
children
to
human
fleshmongers
it
is
often
the
dictate
of
humanity
for
him
to
do
so
for
unless
he
does
this
he
must
not
only
whip
them
himself
but
must
stand
by
and
see
one
white
son
tie
up
his
brother
of
but
few
shades
darker
complexion
than
himself
and
ply
the
gory
lash
to
his
naked
back
and
if
he
lisp
one
word
of
disapproval
it
is
set
down
to
his
parental
partiality
and
only
makes
a
bad
matter
worse
both
for
himself
and
the
slave
whom
he
would
protect
and
defend
every
year
brings
with
it
multitudes
of
this
class
of
slaves
it
was
doubtless
in
consequence
of
a
knowledge
of
this
fact
that
one
great
statesman
of
the
south
predicted
the
downfall
of
slavery
by
the
inevitable
laws
of
population
whether
this
prophecy
is
ever
fulfilled
or
not
it
is
nevertheless
plain
that
a
very
differentlooking
class
of
people
are
springing
up
at
the
south
and
are
now
held
in
slavery
from
those
originally
brought
to
this
country
from
africa
and
if
their
increase
do
no
other
good
it
will
do
away
the
force
of
the
argument
that
god
cursed
ham
and
therefore
american
slavery
is
right
if
the
lineal
descendants
of
ham
are
alone
to
be
scripturally
enslaved
it
is
certain
that
slavery
at
the
south
must
soon
become
unscriptural
for
thousands
are
ushered
into
the
world
annually
who
like
myself
owe
their
existence
to
white
fathers
and
those
fathers
most
frequently
their
own
masters
i
have
had
two
masters
my
first
masters
name
was
anthony
i
do
not
remember
his
first
name
he
was
generally
called
captain
anthonya
title
which
i
presume
he
acquired
by
sailing
a
craft
on
the
chesapeake
bay
he
was
not
considered
a
rich
slaveholder
he
owned
two
or
three
farms
and
about
thirty
slaves
his
farms
and
slaves
were
under
the
care
of
an
overseer
the
overseers
name
was
plummer
mr
plummer
was
a
miserable
drunkard
a
profane
swearer
and
a
savage
monster
he
always
went
armed
with
a
cowskin
and
a
heavy
cudgel
i
have
known
him
to
cut
and
slash
the
womens
heads
so
horribly
that

even
master
would
be
enraged
at
his
cruelty
and
would
threaten
to
whip
him
if
he
did
not
mind
himself
master
however
was
not
a
humane
slaveholder
it
required
extraordinary
barbarity
on
the
part
of
an
overseer
to
affect
him
he
was
a
cruel
man
hardened
by
a
long
life
of
slaveholding
he
would
at
times
seem
to
take
great
pleasure
in
whipping
a
slave
i
have
often
been
awakened
at
the
dawn
of
day
by
the
most
heartrending
shrieks
of
an
own
aunt
of
mine
whom
he
used
to
tie
up
to
a
joist
and
whip
upon
her
naked
back
till
she
was
literally
covered
with
blood
no
words
no
tears
no
prayers
from
his
gory
victim
seemed
to
move
his
iron
heart
from
its
bloody
purpose
the
louder
she
screamed
the
harder
he
whipped
and
where
the
blood
ran
fastest
there
he
whipped
longest
he
would
whip
her
to
make
her
scream
and
whip
her
to
make
her
hush
and
not
until
overcome
by
fatigue
would
he
cease
to
swing
the
bloodclotted
cowskin
i
remember
the
first
time
i
ever
witnessed
this
horrible
exhibition
i
was
quite
a
child
but
i
well
remember
it
i
never
shall
forget
it
whilst
i
remember
any
thing
it
was
the
first
of
a
long
series
of
such
outrages
of
which
i
was
doomed
to
be
a
witness
and
a
participant
it
struck
me
with
awful
force
it
was
the
bloodstained
gate
the
entrance
to
the
hell
of
slavery
through
which
i
was
about
to
pass
it
was
a
most
terrible
spectacle
i
wish
i
could
commit
to
paper
the
feelings
with
which
i
beheld
it
this
occurrence
took
place
very
soon
after
i
went
to
live
with
my
old
master
and
under
the
following
circumstances
aunt
hester
went
out
one
night
where
or
for
what
i
do
not
knowand
happened
to
be
absent
when
my
master
desired
her
presence
he
had
ordered
her
not
to
go
out
evenings
and
warned
her
that
she
must
never
let
him
catch
her
in
company
with
a
young
man
who
was
paying
attention
to
her
belonging
to
colonel
lloyd
the
young
mans
name
was
ned
roberts
generally
called
lloyds
ned
why
master
was
so
careful
of
her
may
be
safely
left
to
conjecture
she
was
a
woman
of
noble
form
and
of
graceful
proportions
having
very
few
equals
and
fewer
superiors
in
personal
appearance
among
the
colored
or
white
women
of
our
neighborhood
aunt
hester
had
not
only
disobeyed
his
orders
in
going
out
but
had
been
found
in
company
with
lloyds
ned
which
circumstance
i
found
from
what
he
said
while
whipping
her
was
the
chief
offence
had
he
been
a
man
of
pure
morals
himself
he
might
have
been
thought
interested
in
protecting
the
innocence
of
my
aunt
but
those
who
knew
him
will
not
suspect
him
of
any
such
virtue
before
he
commenced
whipping
aunt
hester
he
took
her
into
the
kitchen
and
stripped
her
from
neck
to
waist
leaving
her
neck
shoulders
and
back
entirely
naked
he
then
told
her
to
cross
her
hands
calling
her
at
the
same
time
a
dd
bh
after
crossing
her
hands
he
tied
them
with
a
strong
rope
and
led
her
to
a
stool
under
a
large
hook
in
the
joist
put
in
for
the
purpose
he
made
her
get
upon
the
stool
and
tied
her
hands
to
the
hook
she
now
stood
fair
for
his
infernal
purpose
her
arms
were
stretched
up
at
their
full
length
so
that
she
stood
upon
the
ends
of
her
toes
he
then
said
to
her
now
you
dd
bh
ill
learn
you
how
to
disobey
my
orders
and
after
rolling
up
his
sleeves
he
commenced
to
lay
on
the
heavy
cowskin
and
soon
the
warm
red
blood
amid
heartrending
shrieks
from
her
and
horrid
oaths
from
him
came
dripping
to
the
floor
i
was
so
terrified
and
horrorstricken
at
the
sight
that
i
hid
myself
in
a
closet
and
dared
not
venture
out
till
long
after
the
bloody
transaction
was
over
i
expected
it
would
be
my
turn
next
it
was
all
new
to
me
i
had
never
seen
any

thing
like
it
before
i
had
always
lived
with
my
grandmother
on
the
outskirts
of
the
plantation
where
she
was
put
to
raise
the
children
of
the
younger
women
i
had
therefore
been
until
now
out
of
the
way
of
the
bloody
scenes
that
often
occurred
on
the
plantation
chapter
ii
my
masters
family
consisted
of
two
sons
andrew
and
richard
one
daughter
lucretia
and
her
husband
captain
thomas
auld
they
lived
in
one
house
upon
the
home
plantation
of
colonel
edward
lloyd
my
master
was
colonel
lloyds
clerk
and
superintendent
he
was
what
might
be
called
the
overseer
of
the
overseers
i
spent
two
years
of
childhood
on
this
plantation
in
my
old
masters
family
it
was
here
that
i
witnessed
the
bloody
transaction
recorded
in
the
first
chapter
and
as
i
received
my
first
impressions
of
slavery
on
this
plantation
i
will
give
some
description
of
it
and
of
slavery
as
it
there
existed
the
plantation
is
about
twelve
miles
north
of
easton
in
talbot
county
and
is
situated
on
the
border
of
miles
river
the
principal
products
raised
upon
it
were
tobacco
corn
and
wheat
these
were
raised
in
great
abundance
so
that
with
the
products
of
this
and
the
other
farms
belonging
to
him
he
was
able
to
keep
in
almost
constant
employment
a
large
sloop
in
carrying
them
to
market
at
baltimore
this
sloop
was
named
sally
lloyd
in
honor
of
one
of
the
colonels
daughters
my
masters
soninlaw
captain
auld
was
master
of
the
vessel
she
was
otherwise
manned
by
the
colonels
own
slaves
their
names
were
peter
isaac
rich
and
jake
these
were
esteemed
very
highly
by
the
other
slaves
and
looked
upon
as
the
privileged
ones
of
the
plantation
for
it
was
no
small
affair
in
the
eyes
of
the
slaves
to
be
allowed
to
see
baltimore
colonel
lloyd
kept
from
three
to
four
hundred
slaves
on
his
home
plantation
and
owned
a
large
number
more
on
the
neighboring
farms
belonging
to
him
the
names
of
the
farms
nearest
to
the
home
plantation
were
wye
town
and
new
design
wye
town
was
under
the
overseership
of
a
man
named
noah
willis
new
design
was
under
the
overseership
of
a
mr
townsend
the
overseers
of
these
and
all
the
rest
of
the
farms
numbering
over
twenty
received
advice
and
direction
from
the
managers
of
the
home
plantation
this
was
the
great
business
place
it
was
the
seat
of
government
for
the
whole
twenty
farms
all
disputes
among
the
overseers
were
settled
here
if
a
slave
was
convicted
of
any
high
misdemeanor
became
unmanageable
or
evinced
a
determination
to
run
away
he
was
brought
immediately
here
severely
whipped
put
on
board
the
sloop
carried
to
baltimore
and
sold
to
austin
woolfolk
or
some
other
slave
trader
as
a
warning
to
the
slaves
remaining
here
too
the
slaves
of
all
the
other
farms
received
their
monthly
allowance
of
food
and
their
yearly
clothing
the
men
and
women
slaves
received
as
their
monthly
allowance
of
food
eight
pounds
of
pork
or
its
equivalent
in
fish
and
one
bushel
of
corn
meal
their
yearly
clothing
consisted
of
two
coarse
linen
shirts
one
pair
of
linen
trousers
like
the
shirts
one
jacket
one
pair
of
trousers
for
winter
made
of
coarse
negro
cloth
one
pair
of
stockings
and


one
pair
of
shoes
the
whole
of
which
could
not
have
cost
more
than
seven
dollars
the
allowance
of
the
slave
children
was
given
to
their
mothers
or
the
old
women
having
the
care
of
them
the
children
unable
to
work
in
the
field
had
neither
shoes
stockings
jackets
nor
trousers
given
to
them
their
clothing
consisted
of
two
coarse
linen
shirts
per
year
when
these
failed
them
they
went
naked
until
the
next
allowanceday
children
from
seven
to
ten
years
old
of
both
sexes
almost
naked
might
be
seen
at
all
seasons
of
the
year
there
were
no
beds
given
the
slaves
unless
one
coarse
blanket
be
considered
such
and
none
but
the
men
and
women
had
these
this
however
is
not
considered
a
very
great
privation
they
find
less
difficulty
from
the
want
of
beds
than
from
the
want
of

mr
severe
the
overseer
used
to
stand
by
the
door
of
the
quarter
armed
with
a
large
hickory
stick
and
heavy
cowskin
ready
to
whip
any
one
who
was
so
unfortunate
as
not
to
hear
or
from
any
other
cause
was
prevented
from
being
ready
to
start
for
the
field
at
the
sound
of
the
horn
mr
severe
was
rightly
named
he
was
a
cruel
man
i
have
seen
him
whip
a
woman
causing
the
blood
to
run
half
an
hour
at
the
time
and
this
too
in
the
midst
of
her
crying
children
pleading
for
their
mothers
release
he
seemed
to
take
pleasure
in
manifesting
his
fiendish
barbarity
added
to
his
cruelty
he
was
a
profane
swearer
it
was
enough
to
chill
the
blood
and
stiffen
the
hair
of
an
ordinary
man
to
hear
him
talk
scarce
a
sentence
escaped
him
but
that
was
commenced
or
concluded
by
some
horrid
oath
the
field
was
the
place
to
witness
his
cruelty
and
profanity
his
presence
made
it
both
the
field
of
blood
and
of
blasphemy
from
the
rising
till
the
going
down
of
the
sun
he
was
cursing
raving
cutting
and
slashing
among
the
slaves
of
the
field
in
the
most
frightful
manner
his
career
was
short
he
died
very
soon
after
i
went
to
colonel
lloyds
and
he
died
as
he
lived
uttering
with
his
dying
groans
bitter
curses
and
horrid
oaths
his
death
was
regarded
by
the
slaves
as
the
result
of
a
merciful
providence
mr
severes
place
was
filled
by
a
mr
hopkins
he
was
a
very
different
man
he
was
less
cruel
less
profane
and
made
less
noise
than
mr
severe
his
course
was
characterized
by
no
extraordinary
demonstrations
of
cruelty
he
whipped
but
seemed
to
take
no
pleasure
in
it
he
was
called
by
the
slaves
a
good
overseer
the
home
plantation
of
colonel
lloyd
wore
the
appearance
of
a
country
village
all
the
mechanical
operations
for
all
the
farms
were
performed
here
the
shoemaking
and
mending
the
blacksmithing
cartwrighting
coopering

weaving
and
graingrinding
were
all
performed
by
the
slaves
on
the
home
plantation
the
whole
place
wore
a
businesslike
aspect
very
unlike
the
neighboring
farms
the
number
of
houses
too
conspired
to
give
it
advantage
over
the
neighboring
farms
it
was
called
by
the
slaves
the
great
house
farm
few
privileges
were
esteemed
higher
by
the
slaves
of
the
outfarms
than
that
of
being
selected
to
do
errands
at
the
great
house
farm
it
was
associated
in
their
minds
with
greatness
a
representative
could
not
be
prouder
of
his
election
to
a
seat
in
the
american
congress
than
a
slave
on
one
of
the
outfarms
would
be
of
his
election
to
do
errands
at
the
great
house
farm
they
regarded
it
as
evidence
of
great
confidence
reposed
in
them
by
their
overseers
and
it
was
on
this
account
as
well
as
a
constant
desire
to
be
out
of
the
field
from
under
the
drivers
lash
that
they
esteemed
it
a
high
privilege
one
worth
careful
living
for
he
was
called
the
smartest
and
most
trusty
fellow
who
had
this
honor
conferred
upon
him
the
most
frequently
the
competitors
for
this
office
sought
as
diligently
to
please
their
overseers
as
the
officeseekers
in
the
political
parties
seek
to
please
and
deceive
the
people
the
same
traits
of
character
might
be
seen
in
colonel
lloyds
slaves
as
are
seen
in
the
slaves
of
the
political
parties
the
slaves
selected
to
go
to
the
great
house
farm
for
the
monthly
allowance
for
themselves
and
their
fellowslaves
were
peculiarly
enthusiastic
while
on
their
way
they
would
make
the
dense
old
woods
for
miles
around
reverberate
with
their
wild
songs
revealing
at
once
the
highest
joy
and
the
deepest
sadness
they
would
compose
and
sing
as
they
went
along
consulting
neither
time
nor
tune
the
thought
that
came
up
came
outif
not
in
the
word
in
the
soundand
as
frequently
in
the
one
as
in
the
other
they
would
sometimes
sing
the
most
pathetic
sentiment
in
the
most
rapturous
tone
and
the
most
rapturous
sentiment
in
the
most
pathetic
tone
into
all
of
their
songs
they
would
manage
to
weave
something
of
the
great
house
farm
especially
would
they
do
this
when
leaving
home
they
would
then
sing
most
exultingly
the
following
words
i
am
going
away
to
the
great
house
farm
o
yea
o
yea
o
this
they
would
sing
as
a
chorus
to
words
which
to
many
would
seem
unmeaning
jargon
but
which
nevertheless
were
full
of
meaning
to
themselves
i
have
sometimes
thought
that
the
mere
hearing
of
those
songs
would
do
more
to
impress
some
minds
with
the
horrible
character
of
slavery
than
the
reading
of
whole
volumes
of
philosophy
on
the
subject
could
do
i
did
not
when
a
slave
understand
the
deep
meaning
of
those
rude
and
apparently
incoherent
songs
i
was
myself
within
the
circle
so
that
i
neither
saw
nor
heard
as
those
without
might
see
and
hear
they
told
a
tale
of
woe
which
was
then
altogether
beyond
my
feeble
comprehension
they
were
tones
loud
long
and
deep
they
breathed
the
prayer
and
complaint
of
souls
boiling
over
with
the
bitterest
anguish
every
tone
was
a
testimony
against
slavery
and
a
prayer
to
god
for
deliverance
from
chains
the
hearing
of
those
wild
notes
always
depressed
my
spirit
and
filled
me
with
ineffable
sadness
i
have
frequently
found
myself
in
tears
while
hearing
them
the
mere
recurrence
to
those
songs
even
now
afflicts
me
and
while
i
am
writing
these
lines
an

expression
of
feeling
has
already
found
its
way
down
my
cheek
to
those
songs
i
trace
my
first
glimmering
conception
of
the
dehumanizing
character
of
slavery
i
can
never
get
rid
of
that
conception
those
songs
still
follow
me
to
deepen
my
hatred
of
slavery
and
quicken
my
sympathies
for
my
brethren
in
bonds
if
any
one
wishes
to
be
impressed
with
the
soulkilling
effects
of
slavery
let
him
go
to
colonel
lloyds
plantation
and
on
allowanceday
place
himself
in
the
deep
pine
woods
and
there
let
him
in
silence
analyze
the
sounds
that
shall
pass
through
the
chambers
of
his
souland
if
he
is
not
thus
impressed
it
will
only
be
because
there
is
no
flesh
in
his
obdurate
heart
i
have
often
been
utterly
astonished
since
i
came
to
the
north
to
find
persons
who
could
speak
of
the
singing
among
slaves
as
evidence
of
their
contentment
and
happiness
it
is
impossible
to
conceive
of
a
greater
mistake
slaves
sing
most
when
they
are
most
unhappy
the
songs
of
the
slave
represent
the
sorrows
of
his
heart
and
he
is
relieved
by
them
only
as
an
aching
heart
is
relieved
by
its
tears
at
least
such
is
my
experience
i
have
often
sung
to
drown
my
sorrow
but
seldom
to
express
my
happiness
crying
for
joy
and
singing
for
joy
were
alike
uncommon
to
me
while
in
the
jaws
of
slavery
the
singing
of
a
man
cast
away
upon
a
desolate
island
might
be
as
appropriately
considered
as
evidence
of
contentment
and
happiness
as
the
singing
of
a
slave
the
songs
of
the
one
and
of
the
other
are
prompted
by
the
same
emotion
chapter
iii
colonel
lloyd
kept
a
large
and
finely
cultivated
garden
which
afforded
almost
constant
employment
for
four
men
besides
the
chief
gardener
mr
mdurmond
this
garden
was
probably
the
greatest
attraction
of
the
place
during
the
summer
months
people
came
from
far
and
nearfrom
baltimore
easton
and
annapolisto
see
it
it
abounded
in
fruits
of
almost
every
description
from
the
hardy
apple
of
the
north
to
the
delicate
orange
of
the
south
this
garden
was
not
the
least
source
of
trouble
on
the
plantation
its
excellent
fruit
was
quite
a
temptation
to
the
hungry
swarms
of
boys
as
well
as
the
older
slaves
belonging
to
the
colonel
few
of
whom
had
the
virtue
or
the
vice
to
resist
it
scarcely
a
day
passed
during
the
summer
but
that
some
slave
had
to
take
the
lash
for
stealing
fruit
the
colonel
had
to
resort
to
all
kinds
of
stratagems
to
keep
his
slaves
out
of
the
garden
the
last
and
most
successful
one
was
that
of
tarring
his
fence
all
around
after
which
if
a
slave
was
caught
with
any
tar
upon
his
person
it
was
deemed
sufficient
proof
that
he
had
either
been
into
the
garden
or
had
tried
to
get
in
in
either
case
he
was
severely
whipped
by
the
chief
gardener
this
plan
worked
well
the
slaves
became
as
fearful
of
tar
as
of
the
lash
they
seemed
to
realize
the
impossibility
of
touching
tar
without
being
defiled
the
colonel
also
kept
a
splendid
riding
equipage
his
stable
and
carriagehouse
presented
the
appearance
of
some
of
our
large
city
livery
establishments
his
horses
were
of
the
finest
form
and
noblest
blood
his
carriagehouse
contained
three
splendid
coaches
three
or
four
gigs
besides
dearborns
and
barouches
of
the
most
fashionable
style


this
establishment
was
under
the
care
of
two
slavesold
barney
and
young
barneyfather
and
son
to
attend
to
this
establishment
was
their
sole
work
but
it
was
by
no
means
an
easy
employment
for
in
nothing
was
colonel
lloyd
more
particular
than
in
the
management
of
his
horses
the
slightest
inattention
to
these
was
unpardonable
and
was
visited
upon
those
under
whose
care
they
were
placed
with
the
severest
punishment
no
excuse
could
shield
them
if
the
colonel
only
suspected
any
want
of
attention
to
his
horsesa
supposition
which
he
frequently
indulged
and
one
which
of
course
made
the
office
of
old
and
young
barney
a
very
trying
one
they
never
knew
when
they
were
safe
from
punishment
they
were
frequently
whipped
when
least
deserving
and
escaped
whipping
when
most
deserving
it
every
thing
depended
upon
the
looks
of
the
horses
and
the
state
of
colonel
lloyds
own
mind
when
his
horses
were
brought
to
him
for
use
if
a
horse
did
not
move
fast
enough
or
hold
his
head
high
enough
it
was
owing
to
some
fault
of
his
keepers
it
was
painful
to
stand
near
the
stabledoor
and
hear
the
various
complaints
against
the
keepers
when
a
horse
was
taken
out
for
use
this
horse
has
not
had
proper
attention
he
has
not
been
sufficiently
rubbed
and
curried
or
he
has
not
been
properly
fed
his
food
was
too
wet
or
too
dry
he
got
it
too
soon
or
too
late
he
was
too
hot
or
too
cold
he
had
too
much
hay
and
not
enough
of
grain
or
he
had
too
much
grain
and
not
enough
of
hay
instead
of
old
barneys
attending
to
the
horse
he
had
very
improperly
left
it
to
his
son
to
all
these
complaints
no
matter
how
unjust
the
slave
must
answer
never
a
word
colonel
lloyd
could
not
brook
any
contradiction
from
a
slave
when
he
spoke
a
slave
must
stand
listen
and
tremble
and
such
was
literally
the
case
i
have
seen
colonel
lloyd
make
old
barney
a
man
between
fifty
and
sixty
years
of
age
uncover
his
bald
head
kneel
down
upon
the
cold
damp
ground
and
receive
upon
his
naked
and
toilworn
shoulders
more
than
thirty
lashes
at
the
time
colonel
lloyd
had
three
sons
edward
murray
and
danieland
three
sonsinlaw
mr
winder
mr
nicholson
and
mr
lowndes
all
of
these
lived
at
the
great
house
farm
and
enjoyed
the
luxury
of
whipping
the
servants
when
they
pleased
from
old
barney
down
to
william
wilkes
the
coachdriver
i
have
seen
winder
make
one
of
the
houseservants
stand
off
from
him
a
suitable
distance
to
be
touched
with
the
end
of
his
whip
and
at
every
stroke
raise
great
ridges
upon
his
back
to
describe
the
wealth
of
colonel
lloyd
would
be
almost
equal
to
describing
the
riches
of
job
he
kept
from
ten
to
fifteen
houseservants
he
was
said
to
own
a
thousand
slaves
and
i
think
this
estimate
quite
within
the
truth
colonel
lloyd
owned
so
many
that
he
did
not
know
them
when
he
saw
them
nor
did
all
the
slaves
of
the
outfarms
know
him
it
is
reported
of
him
that
while
riding
along
the
road
one
day
he
met
a
colored
man
and
addressed
him
in
the
usual
manner
of
speaking
to
colored
people
on
the
public
highways
of
the
south
well
boy
whom
do
you
belong
to
to
colonel
lloyd
replied
the
slave
well
does
the
colonel
treat
you
well
no
sir
was
the
ready
reply
what
does
he
work
you
too
hard
yes
sir
well
dont
he
give
you
enough
to
eat
yes
sir
he
gives
me
enough
such
as
it
is
the
colonel
after
ascertaining
where
the
slave
belonged
rode
on
the
man
also
went
on
about
his
business
not
dreaming
that
he
had
been
conversing
with
his
master
he
thought
said
and
heard
nothing
more
of
the
matter
until
two
or
three
weeks
afterwards
the
poor
man
was
then
informed
by
his
overseer

that
for
having
found
fault
with
his
master
he
was
now
to
be
sold
to
a
georgia
trader
he
was
immediately
chained
and
handcuffed
and
thus
without
a
moments
warning
he
was
snatched
away
and
forever
sundered
from
his
family
and
friends
by
a
hand
more
unrelenting
than
death
this
is
the
penalty
of
telling
the
truth
of
telling
the
simple
truth
in
answer
to
a
series
of
plain
questions
it
is
partly
in
consequence
of
such
facts
that
slaves
when
inquired
of
as
to
their
condition
and
the
character
of
their
masters
almost
universally
say
they
are
contented
and
that
their
masters
are
kind
the
slaveholders
have
been
known
to
send
in
spies
among
their
slaves
to
ascertain
their
views
and
feelings
in
regard
to
their
condition
the
frequency
of
this
has
had
the
effect
to
establish
among
the
slaves
the
maxim
that
a
still
tongue
makes
a
wise
head
they
suppress
the
truth
rather
than
take
the
consequences
of
telling
it
and
in
so
doing
prove
themselves
a
part
of
the
human
family
if
they
have
any
thing
to
say
of
their
masters
it
is
generally
in
their
masters
favor
especially
when
speaking
to
an
untried
man
i
have
been
frequently
asked
when
a
slave
if
i
had
a
kind
master
and
do
not
remember
ever
to
have
given
a
negative
answer
nor
did
i
in
pursuing
this
course
consider
myself
as
uttering
what
was
absolutely
false
for
i
always
measured
the
kindness
of
my
master
by
the
standard
of
kindness
set
up
among
slaveholders
around
us
moreover
slaves
are
like
other
people
and
imbibe
prejudices
quite
common
to
others
they
think
their
own
better
than
that
of
others
many
under
the
influence
of
this
prejudice
think
their
own
masters
are
better
than
the
masters
of
other
slaves
and
this
too
in
some
cases
when
the
very
reverse
is
true
indeed
it
is
not
uncommon
for
slaves
even
to
fall
out
and
quarrel
among
themselves
about
the
relative
goodness
of
their
masters
each
contending
for
the
superior
goodness
of
his
own
over
that
of
the
others
at
the
very
same
time
they
mutually
execrate
their
masters
when
viewed
separately
it
was
so
on
our
plantation
when
colonel
lloyds
slaves
met
the
slaves
of
jacob
jepson
they
seldom
parted
without
a
quarrel
about
their
masters
colonel
lloyds
slaves
contending
that
he
was
the
richest
and
mr
jepsons
slaves
that
he
was
the
smartest
and
most
of
a
man
colonel
lloyds
slaves
would
boast
his
ability
to
buy
and
sell
jacob
jepson
mr
jepsons
slaves
would
boast
his
ability
to
whip
colonel
lloyd
these
quarrels
would
almost
always
end
in
a
fight
between
the
parties
and
those
that
whipped
were
supposed
to
have
gained
the
point
at
issue
they
seemed
to
think
that
the
greatness
of
their
masters
was
transferable
to
themselves
it
was
considered
as
being
bad
enough
to
be
a
slave
but
to
be
a
poor
mans
slave
was
deemed
a
disgrace
indeed
chapter
iv
mr
hopkins
remained
but
a
short
time
in
the
office
of
overseer
why
his
career
was
so
short
i
do
not
know
but
suppose
he
lacked
the
necessary
severity
to
suit
colonel
lloyd
mr
hopkins
was
succeeded
by
mr
austin
gore
a
man
possessing
in
an
eminent
degree
all
those
traits
of
character
indispensable
to
what
is
called
a
firstrate
overseer
mr
gore
had
served
colonel
lloyd
in
the


capacity
of
overseer
upon
one
of
the
outfarms
and
had
shown
himself
worthy
of
the
high
station
of
overseer
upon
the
home
or
great
house
farm
mr
gore
was
proud
ambitious
and
persevering
he
was
artful
cruel
and
obdurate
he
was
just
the
man
for
such
a
place
and
it
was
just
the
place
for
such
a
man
it
afforded
scope
for
the
full
exercise
of
all
his
powers
and
he
seemed
to
be
perfectly
at
home
in
it
he
was
one
of
those
who
could
torture
the
slightest
look
word
or
gesture
on
the
part
of
the
slave
into
impudence
and
would
treat
it
accordingly
there
must
be
no
answering
back
to
him
no
explanation
was
allowed
a
slave
showing
himself
to
have
been
wrongfully
accused
mr
gore
acted
fully
up
to
the
maxim
laid
down
by
slaveholdersit
is
better
that
a
dozen
slaves
should
suffer
under
the
lash
than
that
the
overseer
should
be
convicted
in
the
presence
of
the
slaves
of
having
been
at
fault
no
matter
how
innocent
a
slave
might
beit
availed
him
nothing
when
accused
by
mr
gore
of
any
misdemeanor
to
be
accused
was
to
be
convicted
and
to
be
convicted
was
to
be
punished
the
one
always
following
the
other
with
immutable
certainty
to
escape
punishment
was
to
escape
accusation
and
few
slaves
had
the
fortune
to
do
either
under
the
overseership
of
mr
gore
he
was
just
proud
enough
to
demand
the
most
debasing
homage
of
the
slave
and
quite
servile
enough
to
crouch
himself
at
the
feet
of
the
master
he
was
ambitious
enough
to
be
contented
with
nothing
short
of
the
highest
rank
of
overseers
and
persevering
enough
to
reach
the
height
of
his
ambition
he
was
cruel
enough
to
inflict
the
severest
punishment
artful
enough
to
descend
to
the
lowest
trickery
and
obdurate
enough
to
be
insensible
to
the
voice
of
a
reproving
conscience
he
was
of
all
the
overseers
the
most
dreaded
by
the
slaves
his
presence
was
painful
his
eye
flashed
confusion
and
seldom
was
his
sharp
shrill
voice
heard
without
producing
horror
and
trembling
in
their
ranks
mr
gore
was
a
grave
man
and
though
a
young
man
he
indulged
in
no
jokes
said
no
funny
words
seldom
smiled
his
words
were
in
perfect
keeping
with
his
looks
and
his
looks
were
in
perfect
keeping
with
his
words
overseers
will
sometimes
indulge
in
a
witty
word
even
with
the
slaves
not
so
with
mr
gore
he
spoke
but
to
command
and
commanded
but
to
be
obeyed
he
dealt
sparingly
with
his
words
and
bountifully
with
his
whip
never
using
the
former
where
the
latter
would
answer
as
well
when
he
whipped
he
seemed
to
do
so
from
a
sense
of
duty
and
feared
no
consequences
he
did
nothing
reluctantly
no
matter
how
disagreeable
always
at
his
post
never
inconsistent
he
never
promised
but
to
fulfil
he
was
in
a
word
a
man
of
the
most
inflexible
firmness
and
stonelike
coolness
his
savage
barbarity
was
equalled
only
by
the
consummate
coolness
with
which
he
committed
the
grossest
and
most
savage
deeds
upon
the
slaves
under
his
charge
mr
gore
once
undertook
to
whip
one
of
colonel
lloyds
slaves
by
the
name
of
demby
he
had
given
demby
but
few
stripes
when
to
get
rid
of
the
scourging
he
ran
and
plunged
himself
into
a
creek
and
stood
there
at
the
depth
of
his
shoulders
refusing
to
come
out
mr
gore
told
him
that
he
would
give
him
three
calls
and
that
if
he
did
not
come
out
at
the
third
call
he
would
shoot
him
the
first
call
was
given
demby
made
no
response
but
stood
his
ground
the
second
and
third
calls
were
given
with
the
same
result
mr
gore
then
without
consultation
or
deliberation
with
any
one
not
even
giving
demby
an
additional
call
raised
his
musket
to
his
face
taking
deadly
aim
at
his
standing

victim
and
in
an
instant
poor
demby
was
no
more
his
mangled
body
sank
out
of
sight
and
blood
and
brains
marked
the
water
where
he
had
stood
a
thrill
of
horror
flashed
through
every
soul
upon
the
plantation
excepting
mr
gore
he
alone
seemed
cool
and
collected
he
was
asked
by
colonel
lloyd
and
my
old
master
why
he
resorted
to
this
extraordinary
expedient
his
reply
was
as
well
as
i
can
remember
that
demby
had
become
unmanageable
he
was
setting
a
dangerous
example
to
the
other
slavesone
which
if
suffered
to
pass
without
some
such
demonstration
on
his
part
would
finally
lead
to
the
total
subversion
of
all
rule
and
order
upon
the
plantation
he
argued
that
if
one
slave
refused
to
be
corrected
and
escaped
with
his
life
the
other
slaves
would
soon
copy
the
example
the
result
of
which
would
be
the
freedom
of
the
slaves
and
the
enslavement
of
the
whites
mr
gores
defence
was
satisfactory
he
was
continued
in
his
station
as
overseer
upon
the
home
plantation
his
fame
as
an
overseer
went
abroad
his
horrid
crime
was
not
even
submitted
to
judicial
investigation
it
was
committed
in
the
presence
of
slaves
and
they
of
course
could
neither
institute
a
suit
nor
testify
against
him
and
thus
the
guilty
perpetrator
of
one
of
the
bloodiest
and
most
foul
murders
goes
unwhipped
of
justice
and
uncensured
by
the
community
in
which
he
lives
mr
gore
lived
in
st
michaels
talbot
county
maryland
when
i
left
there
and
if
he
is
still
alive
he
very
probably
lives
there
now
and
if
so
he
is
now
as
he
was
then
as
highly
esteemed
and
as
much
respected
as
though
his
guilty
soul
had
not
been
stained
with
his
brothers
blood
i
speak
advisedly
when
i
say
thisthat
killing
a
slave
or
any
colored
person
in
talbot
county
maryland
is
not
treated
as
a
crime
either
by
the
courts
or
the
community
mr
thomas
lanman
of
st
michaels
killed
two
slaves
one
of
whom
he
killed
with
a
hatchet
by
knocking
his
brains
out
he
used
to
boast
of
the
commission
of
the
awful
and
bloody
deed
i
have
heard
him
do
so
laughingly
saying
among
other
things
that
he
was
the
only
benefactor
of
his
country
in
the
company
and
that
when
others
would
do
as
much
as
he
had
done
we
should
be
relieved
of
the
dd
niggers
the
wife
of
mr
giles
hicks
living
but
a
short
distance
from
where
i
used
to
live
murdered
my
wifes
cousin
a
young
girl
between
fifteen
and
sixteen
years
of
age
mangling
her
person
in
the
most
horrible
manner
breaking
her
nose
and
breastbone
with
a
stick
so
that
the
poor
girl
expired
in
a
few
hours
afterward
she
was
immediately
buried
but
had
not
been
in
her
untimely
grave
but
a
few
hours
before
she
was
taken
up
and
examined
by
the
coroner
who
decided
that
she
had
come
to
her
death
by
severe
beating
the
offence
for
which
this
girl
was
thus
murdered
was
thisshe
had
been
set
that
night
to
mind
mrs
hickss
baby
and
during
the
night
she
fell
asleep
and
the
baby
cried
she
having
lost
her
rest
for
several
nights
previous
did
not
hear
the
crying
they
were
both
in
the
room
with
mrs
hicks
mrs
hicks
finding
the
girl
slow
to
move
jumped
from
her
bed
seized
an
oak
stick
of
wood
by
the
fireplace
and
with
it
broke
the
girls
nose
and
breastbone
and
thus
ended
her
life
i
will
not
say
that
this
most
horrid
murder
produced
no
sensation
in
the
community
it
did
produce
sensation
but
not
enough
to
bring
the
murderess
to
punishment
there
was
a
warrant
issued
for
her
arrest
but
it
was
never
served
thus
she
escaped
not
only
punishment
but
even
the
pain
of
being
arraigned
before
a
court
for
her
horrid
crime

whilst
i
am
detailing
bloody
deeds
which
took
place
during
my
stay
on
colonel
lloyds
plantation
i
will
briefly
narrate
another
which
occurred
about
the
same
time
as
the
murder
of
demby
by
mr
gore
colonel
lloyds
slaves
were
in
the
habit
of
spending
a
part
of
their
nights
and
sundays
in
fishing
for
oysters
and
in
this
way
made
up
the
deficiency
of
their
scanty
allowance
an
old
man
belonging
to
colonel
lloyd
while
thus
engaged
happened
to
get
beyond
the
limits
of
colonel
lloyds
and
on
the
premises
of
mr
beal
bondly
at
this
trespass
mr
bondly
took
offence
and
with
his
musket
came
down
to
the
shore
and
blew
its
deadly
contents
into
the
poor
old
man
mr
bondly
came
over
to
see
colonel
lloyd
the
next
day
whether
to
pay
him
for
his
property
or
to
justify
himself
in
what
he
had
done
i
know
not
at
any
rate
this
whole
fiendish
transaction
was
soon
hushed
up
there
was
very
little
said
about
it
at
all
and
nothing
done
it
was
a
common
saying
even
among
little
white
boys
that
it
was
worth
a
halfcent
to
kill
a
nigger
and
a
halfcent
to
bury
one
chapter
v
as
to
my
own
treatment
while
i
lived
on
colonel
lloyds
plantation
it
was
very
similar
to
that
of
the
other
slave
children
i
was
not
old
enough
to
work
in
the
field
and
there
being
little
else
than
field
work
to
do
i
had
a
great
deal
of
leisure
time
the
most
i
had
to
do
was
to
drive
up
the
cows
at
evening
keep
the
fowls
out
of
the
garden
keep
the
front
yard
clean
and
run
of
errands
for
my
old
masters
daughter
mrs
lucretia
auld
the
most
of
my
leisure
time
i
spent
in
helping
master
daniel
lloyd
in
finding
his
birds
after
he
had
shot
them
my
connection
with
master
daniel
was
of
some
advantage
to
me
he
became
quite
attached
to
me
and
was
a
sort
of
protector
of
me
he
would
not
allow
the
older
boys
to
impose
upon
me
and
would
divide
his
cakes
with
me
i
was
seldom
whipped
by
my
old
master
and
suffered
little
from
any
thing
else
than
hunger
and
cold
i
suffered
much
from
hunger
but
much
more
from
cold
in
hottest
summer
and
coldest
winter
i
was
kept
almost
nakedno
shoes
no
stockings
no
jacket
no
trousers
nothing
on
but
a
coarse
tow
linen
shirt
reaching
only
to
my
knees
i
had
no
bed
i
must
have
perished
with
cold
but
that
the
coldest
nights
i
used
to
steal
a
bag
which
was
used
for
carrying
corn
to
the
mill
i
would
crawl
into
this
bag
and
there
sleep
on
the
cold
damp
clay
floor
with
my
head
in
and
feet
out
my
feet
have
been
so
cracked
with
the
frost
that
the
pen
with
which
i
am
writing
might
be
laid
in
the
gashes
we
were
not
regularly
allowanced
our
food
was
coarse
corn
meal
boiled
this
was
called
mush
it
was
put
into
a
large
wooden
tray
or
trough
and
set
down
upon
the
ground
the
children
were
then
called
like
so
many
pigs
and
like
so
many
pigs
they
would
come
and
devour
the
mush
some
with
oystershells
others
with
pieces
of
shingle
some
with
naked
hands
and
none
with
spoons
he
that
ate
fastest
got
most
he
that
was
strongest
secured
the
best
place
and
few
left
the
trough
satisfied


i
was
probably
between
seven
and
eight
years
old
when
i
left
colonel
lloyds
plantation
i
left
it
with
joy
i
shall
never
forget
the
ecstasy
with
which
i
received
the
intelligence
that
my
old
master
anthony
had
determined
to
let
me
go
to
baltimore
to
live
with
mr
hugh
auld
brother
to
my
old
masters
sonin
law
captain
thomas
auld
i
received
this
information
about
three
days
before
my
departure
they
were
three
of
the
happiest
days
i
ever
enjoyed
i
spent
the
most
part
of
all
these
three
days
in
the
creek
washing
off
the
plantation
scurf
and
preparing
myself
for
my
departure
the
pride
of
appearance
which
this
would
indicate
was
not
my
own
i
spent
the
time
in
washing
not
so
much
because
i
wished
to
but
because
mrs
lucretia
had
told
me
i
must
get
all
the
dead
skin
off
my
feet
and
knees
before
i
could
go
to
baltimore
for
the
people
in
baltimore
were
very
cleanly
and
would
laugh
at
me
if
i
looked
dirty
besides
she
was
going
to
give
me
a
pair
of
trousers
which
i
should
not
put
on
unless
i
got
all
the
dirt
off
me
the
thought
of
owning
a
pair
of
trousers
was
great
indeed
it
was
almost
a
sufficient
motive
not
only
to
make
me
take
off
what
would
be
called
by
pigdrovers
the
mange
but
the
skin
itself
i
went
at
it
in
good
earnest
working
for
the
first
time
with
the
hope
of
reward
the
ties
that
ordinarily
bind
children
to
their
homes
were
all
suspended
in
my
case
i
found
no
severe
trial
in
my
departure
my
home
was
charmless
it
was
not
home
to
me
on
parting
from
it
i
could
not
feel
that
i
was
leaving
any
thing
which
i
could
have
enjoyed
by
staying
my
mother
was
dead
my
grandmother
lived
far
off
so
that
i
seldom
saw
her
i
had
two
sisters
and
one
brother
that
lived
in
the
same
house
with
me
but
the
early
separation
of
us
from
our
mother
had
well
nigh
blotted
the
fact
of
our
relationship
from
our
memories
i
looked
for
home
elsewhere
and
was
confident
of
finding
none
which
i
should
relish
less
than
the
one
which
i
was
leaving
if
however
i
found
in
my
new
home
hardship
hunger
whipping
and
nakedness
i
had
the
consolation
that
i
should
not
have
escaped
any
one
of
them
by
staying
having
already
had
more
than
a
taste
of
them
in
the
house
of
my
old
master
and
having
endured
them
there
i
very
naturally
inferred
my
ability
to
endure
them
elsewhere
and
especially
at
baltimore
for
i
had
something
of
the
feeling
about
baltimore
that
is
expressed
in
the
proverb
that
being
hanged
in
england
is
preferable
to
dying
a
natural
death
in
ireland
i
had
the
strongest
desire
to
see
baltimore
cousin
tom
though
not
fluent
in
speech
had
inspired
me
with
that
desire
by
his
eloquent
description
of
the
place
i
could
never
point
out
any
thing
at
the
great
house
no
matter
how
beautiful
or
powerful
but
that
he
had
seen
something
at
baltimore
far
exceeding
both
in
beauty
and
strength
the
object
which
i
pointed
out
to
him
even
the
great
house
itself
with
all
its
pictures
was
far
inferior
to
many
buildings
in
baltimore
so
strong
was
my
desire
that
i
thought
a
gratification
of
it
would
fully
compensate
for
whatever
loss
of
comforts
i
should
sustain
by
the
exchange
i
left
without
a
regret
and
with
the
highest
hopes
of
future
happiness
we
sailed
out
of
miles
river
for
baltimore
on
a
saturday
morning
i
remember
only
the
day
of
the
week
for
at
that
time
i
had
no
knowledge
of
the
days
of
the
month
nor
the
months
of
the
year
on
setting
sail
i
walked
aft
and
gave
to
colonel
lloyds
plantation
what
i
hoped
would
be
the
last
look
i
then
placed
myself
in
the
bows
of
the
sloop
and
there
spent
the
remainder
of
the
day

in
looking
ahead
interesting
myself
in
what
was
in
the
distance
rather
than
in
things
near
by
or
behind
in
the
afternoon
of
that
day
we
reached
annapolis
the
capital
of
the
state
we
stopped
but
a
few
moments
so
that
i
had
no
time
to
go
on
shore
it
was
the
first
large
town
that
i
had
ever
seen
and
though
it
would
look
small
compared
with
some
of
our
new
england
factory
villages
i
thought
it
a
wonderful
place
for
its
sizemore
imposing
even
than
the
great
house
farm
we
arrived
at
baltimore
early
on
sunday
morning
landing
at
smiths
wharf
not
far
from
bowleys
wharf
we
had
on
board
the
sloop
a
large
flock
of
sheep
and
after
aiding
in
driving
them
to
the
slaughterhouse
of
mr
curtis
on
louden
slaters
hill
i
was
conducted
by
rich
one
of
the
hands
belonging
on
board
of
the
sloop
to
my
new
home
in
alliciana
street
near
mr
gardners
ship
yard
on
fells
point
mr
and
mrs
auld
were
both
at
home
and
met
me
at
the
door
with
their
little
son
thomas
to
take
care
of
whom
i
had
been
given
and
here
i
saw
what
i
had
never
seen
before
it
was
a
white
face
beaming
with
the
most
kindly
emotions
it
was
the
face
of
my
new
mistress
sophia
auld
i
wish
i
could
describe
the
rapture
that
flashed
through
my
soul
as
i
beheld
it
it
was
a
new
and
strange
sight
to
me
brightening
up
my
pathway
with
the
light
of
happiness
little
thomas
was
told
there
was
his
freddyand
i
was
told
to
take
care
of
little
thomas
and
thus
i
entered
upon
the
duties
of
my
new
home
with
the
most
cheering
prospect
ahead
i
look
upon
my
departure
from
colonel
lloyds
plantation
as
one
of
the
most
interesting
events
of
my
life
it
is
possible
and
even
quite
probable
that
but
for
the
mere
circumstance
of
being
removed
from
that
plantation
to
baltimore
i
should
have
today
instead
of
being
here
seated
by
my
own
table
in
the
enjoyment
of
freedom
and
the
happiness
of
home
writing
this
narrative
been
confined
in
the
galling
chains
of
slavery
going
to
live
at
baltimore
laid
the
foundation
and
opened
the
gateway
to
all
my
subsequent
prosperity
i
have
ever
regarded
it
as
the
first
plain
manifestation
of
that
kind
providence
which
has
ever
since
attended
me
and
marked
my
life
with
so
many
favors
i
regarded
the
selection
of
myself
as
being
somewhat
remarkable
there
were
a
number
of
slave
children
that
might
have
been
sent
from
the
plantation
to
baltimore
there
were
those
younger
those
older
and
those
of
the
same
age
i
was
chosen
from
among
them
all
and
was
the
first
last
and
only
choice
i
may
be
deemed
superstitious
and
even
egotistical
in
regarding
this
event
as
a
special
interposition
of
divine
providence
in
my
favor
but
i
should
be
false
to
the
earliest
sentiments
of
my
soul
if
i
suppressed
the
opinion
i
prefer
to
be
true
to
myself
even
at
the
hazard
of
incurring
the
ridicule
of
others
rather
than
to
be
false
and
incur
my
own
abhorrence
from
my
earliest
recollection
i
date
the
entertainment
of
a
deep
conviction
that
slavery
would
not
always
be
able
to
hold
me
within
its
foul
embrace
and
in
the
darkest
hours
of
my
career
in
slavery
this
living
word
of
faith
and
spirit
of
hope
departed
not
from
me
but
remained
like
ministering
angels
to
cheer
me
through
the
gloom
this
good
spirit
was
from
god
and
to
him
i
offer
thanksgiving
and
praise


chapter
vi
my
new
mistress
proved
to
be
all
she
appeared
when
i
first
met
her
at
the
doora
woman
of
the
kindest
heart
and
finest
feelings
she
had
never
had
a
slave
under
her
control
previously
to
myself
and
prior
to
her
marriage
she
had
been
dependent
upon
her
own
industry
for
a
living
she
was
by
trade
a
weaver
and
by
constant
application
to
her
business
she
had
been
in
a
good
degree
preserved
from
the
blighting
and
dehumanizing
effects
of
slavery
i
was
utterly
astonished
at
her
goodness
i
scarcely
knew
how
to
behave
towards
her
she
was
entirely
unlike
any
other
white
woman
i
had
ever
seen
i
could
not
approach
her
as
i
was
accustomed
to
approach
other
white
ladies
my
early
instruction
was
all
out
of
place
the
crouching
servility
usually
so
acceptable
a
quality
in
a
slave
did
not
answer
when
manifested
toward
her
her
favor
was
not
gained
by
it
she
seemed
to
be
disturbed
by
it
she
did
not
deem
it
impudent
or
unmannerly
for
a
slave
to
look
her
in
the
face
the
meanest
slave
was
put
fully
at
ease
in
her
presence
and
none
left
without
feeling
better
for
having
seen
her
her
face
was
made
of
heavenly
smiles
and
her
voice
of
tranquil
music
but
alas
this
kind
heart
had
but
a
short
time
to
remain
such
the
fatal
poison
of
irresponsible
power
was
already
in
her
hands
and
soon
commenced
its
infernal
work
that
cheerful
eye
under
the
influence
of
slavery
soon
became
red
with
rage
that
voice
made
all
of
sweet
accord
changed
to
one
of
harsh
and
horrid
discord
and
that
angelic
face
gave
place
to
that
of
a
demon
very
soon
after
i
went
to
live
with
mr
and
mrs
auld
she
very
kindly
commenced
to
teach
me
the
a
b
c
after
i
had
learned
this
she
assisted
me
in
learning
to
spell
words
of
three
or
four
letters
just
at
this
point
of
my
progress
mr
auld
found
out
what
was
going
on
and
at
once
forbade
mrs
auld
to
instruct
me
further
telling
her
among
other
things
that
it
was
unlawful
as
well
as
unsafe
to
teach
a
slave
to
read
to
use
his
own
words
further
he
said
if
you
give
a
nigger
an
inch
he
will
take
an
ell
a
nigger
should
know
nothing
but
to
obey
his
masterto
do
as
he
is
told
to
do
learning
would
spoil
the
best
nigger
in
the
world
now
said
he
if
you
teach
that
nigger
speaking
of
myself
how
to
read
there
would
be
no
keeping
him
it
would
forever
unfit
him
to
be
a
slave
he
would
at
once
become
unmanageable
and
of
no
value
to
his
master
as
to
himself
it
could
do
him
no
good
but
a
great
deal
of
harm
it
would
make
him
discontented
and
unhappy
these
words
sank
deep
into
my
heart
stirred
up
sentiments
within
that
lay
slumbering
and
called
into
existence
an
entirely
new
train
of
thought
it
was
a
new
and
special
revelation
explaining
dark
and
mysterious
things
with
which
my
youthful
understanding
had
struggled
but
struggled
in
vain
i
now
understood
what
had
been
to
me
a
most
perplexing
difficultyto
wit
the
white
mans
power
to
enslave
the
black
man
it
was
a
grand
achievement
and
i
prized
it
highly
from
that
moment
i
understood
the
pathway
from
slavery
to
freedom
it
was
just
what
i
wanted
and
i
got
it
at
a
time
when
i
the
least
expected
it
whilst
i
was
saddened
by
the
thought
of
losing
the
aid
of
my
kind
mistress
i
was
gladdened
by
the
invaluable
instruction
which
by
the
merest
accident
i
had
gained
from
my
master
though
conscious
of
the
difficulty
of
learning
without
a
teacher
i
set
out
with
high
hope
and
a
fixed
purpose
at
whatever
cost
of
trouble
to
learn
how
to
read
the
very
decided

manner
with
which
he
spoke
and
strove
to
impress
his
wife
with
the
evil
consequences
of
giving
me
instruction
served
to
convince
me
that
he
was
deeply
sensible
of
the
truths
he
was
uttering
it
gave
me
the
best
assurance
that
i
might
rely
with
the
utmost
confidence
on
the
results
which
he
said
would
flow
from
teaching
me
to
read
what
he
most
dreaded
that
i
most
desired
what
he
most
loved
that
i
most
hated
that
which
to
him
was
a
great
evil
to
be
carefully
shunned
was
to
me
a
great
good
to
be
diligently
sought
and
the
argument
which
he
so
warmly
urged
against
my
learning
to
read
only
served
to
inspire
me
with
a
desire
and
determination
to
learn
in
learning
to
read
i
owe
almost
as
much
to
the
bitter
opposition
of
my
master
as
to
the
kindly
aid
of
my
mistress
i
acknowledge
the
benefit
of
both
i
had
resided
but
a
short
time
in
baltimore
before
i
observed
a
marked
difference
in
the
treatment
of
slaves
from
that
which
i
had
witnessed
in
the
country
a
city
slave
is
almost
a
freeman
compared
with
a
slave
on
the
plantation
he
is
much
better
fed
and
clothed
and
enjoys
privileges
altogether
unknown
to
the
slave
on
the
plantation
there
is
a
vestige
of
decency
a
sense
of
shame
that
does
much
to
curb
and
check
those
outbreaks
of
atrocious
cruelty
so
commonly
enacted
upon
the
plantation
he
is
a
desperate
slaveholder
who
will
shock
the
humanity
of
his
nonslaveholding
neighbors
with
the
cries
of
his
lacerated
slave
few
are
willing
to
incur
the
odium
attaching
to
the
reputation
of
being
a
cruel
master
and
above
all
things
they
would
not
be
known
as
not
giving
a
slave
enough
to
eat
every
city
slaveholder
is
anxious
to
have
it
known
of
him
that
he
feeds
his
slaves
well
and
it
is
due
to
them
to
say
that
most
of
them
do
give
their
slaves
enough
to
eat
there
are
however
some
painful
exceptions
to
this
rule
directly
opposite
to
us
on
philpot
street
lived
mr
thomas
hamilton
he
owned
two
slaves
their
names
were
henrietta
and
mary
henrietta
was
about
twentytwo
years
of
age
mary
was
about
fourteen
and
of
all
the
mangled
and
emaciated
creatures
i
ever
looked
upon
these
two
were
the
most
so
his
heart
must
be
harder
than
stone
that
could
look
upon
these
unmoved
the
head
neck
and
shoulders
of
mary
were
literally
cut
to
pieces
i
have
frequently
felt
her
head
and
found
it
nearly
covered
with
festering
sores
caused
by
the
lash
of
her
cruel
mistress
i
do
not
know
that
her
master
ever
whipped
her
but
i
have
been
an
eyewitness
to
the
cruelty
of
mrs
hamilton
i
used
to
be
in
mr
hamiltons
house
nearly
every
day
mrs
hamilton
used
to
sit
in
a
large
chair
in
the
middle
of
the
room
with
a
heavy
cowskin
always
by
her
side
and
scarce
an
hour
passed
during
the
day
but
was
marked
by
the
blood
of
one
of
these
slaves
the
girls
seldom
passed
her
without
her
saying
move
faster
you
black
gip
at
the
same
time
giving
them
a
blow
with
the
cowskin
over
the
head
or
shoulders
often
drawing
the
blood
she
would
then
say
take
that
you
black
gip
continuing
if
you
dont
move
faster
ill
move
you
added
to
the
cruel
lashings
to
which
these
slaves
were
subjected
they
were
kept
nearly
halfstarved
they
seldom
knew
what
it
was
to
eat
a
full
meal
i
have
seen
mary
contending
with
the
pigs
for
the
offal
thrown
into
the
street
so
much
was
mary
kicked
and
cut
to
pieces
that
she
was
oftener
called
pecked
than
by
her
name


chapter
vii
i
lived
in
master
hughs
family
about
seven
years
during
this
time
i
succeeded
in
learning
to
read
and
write
in
accomplishing
this
i
was
compelled
to
resort
to
various
stratagems
i
had
no
regular
teacher
my
mistress
who
had
kindly
commenced
to
instruct
me
had
in
compliance
with
the
advice
and
direction
of
her
husband
not
only
ceased
to
instruct
but
had
set
her
face
against
my
being
instructed
by
any
one
else
it
is
due
however
to
my
mistress
to
say
of
her
that
she
did
not
adopt
this
course
of
treatment
immediately
she
at
first
lacked
the
depravity
indispensable
to
shutting
me
up
in
mental
darkness
it
was
at
least
necessary
for
her
to
have
some
training
in
the
exercise
of
irresponsible
power
to
make
her
equal
to
the
task
of
treating
me
as
though
i
were
a
brute
my
mistress
was
as
i
have
said
a
kind
and
tenderhearted
woman
and
in
the
simplicity
of
her
soul
she
commenced
when
i
first
went
to
live
with
her
to
treat
me
as
she
supposed
one
human
being
ought
to
treat
another
in
entering
upon
the
duties
of
a
slaveholder
she
did
not
seem
to
perceive
that
i
sustained
to
her
the
relation
of
a
mere
chattel
and
that
for
her
to
treat
me
as
a
human
being
was
not
only
wrong
but
dangerously
so
slavery
proved
as
injurious
to
her
as
it
did
to
me
when
i
went
there
she
was
a
pious
warm
and
tenderhearted
woman
there
was
no
sorrow
or
suffering
for
which
she
had
not
a
tear
she
had
bread
for
the
hungry
clothes
for
the
naked
and
comfort
for
every
mourner
that
came
within
her
reach
slavery
soon
proved
its
ability
to
divest
her
of
these
heavenly
qualities
under
its
influence
the
tender
heart
became
stone
and
the
lamblike
disposition
gave
way
to
one
of
tigerlike
fierceness
the
first
step
in
her
downward
course
was
in
her
ceasing
to
instruct
me
she
now
commenced
to
practise
her
husbands
precepts
she
finally
became
even
more
violent
in
her
opposition
than
her
husband
himself
she
was
not
satisfied
with
simply
doing
as
well
as
he
had
commanded
she
seemed
anxious
to
do
better
nothing
seemed
to
make
her
more
angry
than
to
see
me
with
a
newspaper
she
seemed
to
think
that
here
lay
the
danger
i
have
had
her
rush
at
me
with
a
face
made
all
up
of
fury
and
snatch
from
me
a
newspaper
in
a
manner
that
fully
revealed
her
apprehension
she
was
an
apt
woman
and
a
little
experience
soon
demonstrated
to
her
satisfaction
that
education
and
slavery
were
incompatible
with
each
other
from
this
time
i
was
most
narrowly
watched
if
i
was
in
a
separate
room
any
considerable
length
of
time
i
was
sure
to
be
suspected
of
having
a
book
and
was
at
once
called
to
give
an
account
of
myself
all
this
however
was
too
late
the
first
step
had
been
taken
mistress
in
teaching
me
the
alphabet
had
given
me
the
inch
and
no
precaution
could
prevent
me
from
taking
the
ell
the
plan
which
i
adopted
and
the
one
by
which
i
was
most
successful
was
that
of
making
friends
of
all
the
little
white
boys
whom
i
met
in
the
street
as
many
of
these
as
i
could
i
converted
into
teachers
with
their
kindly
aid
obtained
at
different
times
and
in
different
places
i
finally
succeeded
in
learning
to
read
when
i
was
sent
of
errands
i
always
took
my
book
with
me
and
by
going
one
part
of
my
errand
quickly
i
found
time
to
get
a
lesson
before
my
return
i
used
also
to
carry
bread
with
me
enough
of
which
was
always
in
the
house
and
to
which
i
was
always
welcome
for
i
was
much
better
off
in
this
regard
than
many
of
the
poor
white
children
in
our
neighborhood
this
bread
i

used
to
bestow
upon
the
hungry
little
urchins
who
in
return
would
give
me
that
more
valuable
bread
of
knowledge
i
am
strongly
tempted
to
give
the
names
of
two
or
three
of
those
little
boys
as
a
testimonial
of
the
gratitude
and
affection
i
bear
them
but
prudence
forbidsnot
that
it
would
injure
me
but
it
might
embarrass
them
for
it
is
almost
an
unpardonable
offence
to
teach
slaves
to
read
in
this
christian
country
it
is
enough
to
say
of
the
dear
little
fellows
that
they
lived
on
philpot
street
very
near
durgin
and
baileys
shipyard
i
used
to
talk
this
matter
of
slavery
over
with
them
i
would
sometimes
say
to
them
i
wished
i
could
be
as
free
as
they
would
be
when
they
got
to
be
men
you
will
be
free
as
soon
as
you
are
twentyone
but
i
am
a
slave
for
life
have
not
i
as
good
a
right
to
be
free
as
you
have
these
words
used
to
trouble
them
they
would
express
for
me
the
liveliest
sympathy
and
console
me
with
the
hope
that
something
would
occur
by
which
i
might
be
free
i
was
now
about
twelve
years
old
and
the
thought
of
being
a
slave
for
life
began
to
bear
heavily
upon
my
heart
just
about
this
time
i
got
hold
of
a
book
entitled
the
columbian
orator
every
opportunity
i
got
i
used
to
read
this
book
among
much
of
other
interesting
matter
i
found
in
it
a
dialogue
between
a
master
and
his
slave
the
slave
was
represented
as
having
run
away
from
his
master
three
times
the
dialogue
represented
the
conversation
which
took
place
between
them
when
the
slave
was
retaken
the
third
time
in
this
dialogue
the
whole
argument
in
behalf
of
slavery
was
brought
forward
by
the
master
all
of
which
was
disposed
of
by
the
slave
the
slave
was
made
to
say
some
very
smart
as
well
as
impressive
things
in
reply
to
his
masterthings
which
had
the
desired
though
unexpected
effect
for
the
conversation
resulted
in
the
voluntary
emancipation
of
the
slave
on
the
part
of
the
master
in
the
same
book
i
met
with
one
of
sheridans
mighty
speeches
on
and
in
behalf
of
catholic
emancipation
these
were
choice
documents
to
me
i
read
them
over
and
over
again
with
unabated
interest
they
gave
tongue
to
interesting
thoughts
of
my
own
soul
which
had
frequently
flashed
through
my
mind
and
died
away
for
want
of
utterance
the
moral
which
i
gained
from
the
dialogue
was
the
power
of
truth
over
the
conscience
of
even
a
slaveholder
what
i
got
from
sheridan
was
a
bold
denunciation
of
slavery
and
a
powerful
vindication
of
human
rights
the
reading
of
these
documents
enabled
me
to
utter
my
thoughts
and
to
meet
the
arguments
brought
forward
to
sustain
slavery
but
while
they
relieved
me
of
one
difficulty
they
brought
on
another
even
more
painful
than
the
one
of
which
i
was
relieved
the
more
i
read
the
more
i
was
led
to
abhor
and
detest
my
enslavers
i
could
regard
them
in
no
other
light
than
a
band
of
successful
robbers
who
had
left
their
homes
and
gone
to
africa
and
stolen
us
from
our
homes
and
in
a
strange
land
reduced
us
to
slavery
i
loathed
them
as
being
the
meanest
as
well
as
the
most
wicked
of
men
as
i
read
and
contemplated
the
subject
behold
that
very
discontentment
which
master
hugh
had
predicted
would
follow
my
learning
to
read
had
already
come
to
torment
and
sting
my
soul
to
unutterable
anguish
as
i
writhed
under
it
i
would
at
times
feel
that
learning
to
read
had
been
a
curse
rather
than
a
blessing
it
had
given
me
a
view
of
my
wretched
condition
without
the
remedy
it
opened
my
eyes
to
the
horrible
pit
but
to
no
ladder
upon
which
to
get
out
in
moments
of
agony
i
envied
my
fellowslaves
for
their
stupidity
i
have
often
wished
myself
a
beast
i
preferred
the
condition
of
the
meanest
reptile
to
my
own
any
thing
no
matter

what
to
get
rid
of
thinking
it
was
this
everlasting
thinking
of
my
condition
that
tormented
me
there
was
no
getting
rid
of
it
it
was
pressed
upon
me
by
every
object
within
sight
or
hearing
animate
or
inanimate
the
silver
trump
of
freedom
had
roused
my
soul
to
eternal
wakefulness
freedom
now
appeared
to
disappear
no
more
forever
it
was
heard
in
every
sound
and
seen
in
every
thing
it
was
ever
present
to
torment
me
with
a
sense
of
my
wretched
condition
i
saw
nothing
without
seeing
it
i
heard
nothing
without
hearing
it
and
felt
nothing
without
feeling
it
it
looked
from
every
star
it
smiled
in
every
calm
breathed
in
every
wind
and
moved
in
every
storm
i
often
found
myself
regretting
my
own
existence
and
wishing
myself
dead
and
but
for
the
hope
of
being
free
i
have
no
doubt
but
that
i
should
have
killed
myself
or
done
something
for
which
i
should
have
been
killed
while
in
this
state
of
mind
i
was
eager
to
hear
any
one
speak
of
slavery
i
was
a
ready
listener
every
little
while
i
could
hear
something
about
the
abolitionists
it
was
some
time
before
i
found
what
the
word
meant
it
was
always
used
in
such
connections
as
to
make
it
an
interesting
word
to
me
if
a
slave
ran
away
and
succeeded
in
getting
clear
or
if
a
slave
killed
his
master
set
fire
to
a
barn
or
did
any
thing
very
wrong
in
the
mind
of
a
slaveholder
it
was
spoken
of
as
the
fruit
of
abolition
hearing
the
word
in
this
connection
very
often
i
set
about
learning
what
it
meant
the
dictionary
afforded
me
little
or
no
help
i
found
it
was
the
act
of
abolishing
but
then
i
did
not
know
what
was
to
be
abolished
here
i
was
perplexed
i
did
not
dare
to
ask
any
one
about
its
meaning
for
i
was
satisfied
that
it
was
something
they
wanted
me
to
know
very
little
about
after
a
patient
waiting
i
got
one
of
our
city
papers
containing
an
account
of
the
number
of
petitions
from
the
north
praying
for
the
abolition
of
slavery
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
of
the
slave
trade
between
the
states
from
this
time
i
understood
the
words
abolition
and
abolitionist
and
always
drew
near
when
that
word
was
spoken
expecting
to
hear
something
of
importance
to
myself
and
fellow
slaves
the
light
broke
in
upon
me
by
degrees
i
went
one
day
down
on
the
wharf
of
mr
waters
and
seeing
two
irishmen
unloading
a
scow
of
stone
i
went
unasked
and
helped
them
when
we
had
finished
one
of
them
came
to
me
and
asked
me
if
i
were
a
slave
i
told
him
i
was
he
asked
are
ye
a
slave
for
life
i
told
him
that
i
was
the
good
irishman
seemed
to
be
deeply
affected
by
the
statement
he
said
to
the
other
that
it
was
a
pity
so
fine
a
little
fellow
as
myself
should
be
a
slave
for
life
he
said
it
was
a
shame
to
hold
me
they
both
advised
me
to
run
away
to
the
north
that
i
should
find
friends
there
and
that
i
should
be
free
i
pretended
not
to
be
interested
in
what
they
said
and
treated
them
as
if
i
did
not
understand
them
for
i
feared
they
might
be
treacherous
white
men
have
been
known
to
encourage
slaves
to
escape
and
then
to
get
the
reward
catch
them
and
return
them
to
their
masters
i
was
afraid
that
these
seemingly
good
men
might
use
me
so
but
i
nevertheless
remembered
their
advice
and
from
that
time
i
resolved
to
run
away
i
looked
forward
to
a
time
at
which
it
would
be
safe
for
me
to
escape
i
was
too
young
to
think
of
doing
so
immediately
besides
i
wished
to
learn
how
to
write
as
i
might
have
occasion
to
write
my
own
pass
i
consoled
myself
with
the
hope
that
i
should
one
day
find
a
good
chance
meanwhile
i
would
learn
to
write
the
idea
as
to
how
i
might
learn
to
write
was
suggested
to
me
by
being
in
durgin
and
baileys
shipyard
and
frequently
seeing
the
ship
carpenters
after

hewing
and
getting
a
piece
of
timber
ready
for
use
write
on
the
timber
the
name
of
that
part
of
the
ship
for
which
it
was
intended
when
a
piece
of
timber
was
intended
for
the
larboard
side
it
would
be
marked
thusl
when
a
piece
was
for
the
starboard
side
it
would
be
marked
thuss
a
piece
for
the
larboard
side
forward
would
be
marked
thusl
f
when
a
piece
was
for
starboard
side
forward
it
would
be
marked
thuss
f
for
larboard
aft
it
would
be
marked
thusl
a
for
starboard
aft
it
would
be
marked
thuss
a
i
soon
learned
the
names
of
these
letters
and
for
what
they
were
intended
when
placed
upon
a
piece
of
timber
in
the
shipyard
i
immediately
commenced
copying
them
and
in
a
short
time
was
able
to
make
the
four
letters
named
after
that
when
i
met
with
any
boy
who
i
knew
could
write
i
would
tell
him
i
could
write
as
well
as
he
the
next
word
would
be
i
dont
believe
you
let
me
see
you
try
it
i
would
then
make
the
letters
which
i
had
been
so
fortunate
as
to
learn
and
ask
him
to
beat
that
in
this
way
i
got
a
good
many
lessons
in
writing
which
it
is
quite
possible
i
should
never
have
gotten
in
any
other
way
during
this
time
my
copybook
was
the
board
fence
brick
wall
and
pavement
my
pen
and
ink
was
a
lump
of
chalk
with
these
i
learned
mainly
how
to
write
i
then
commenced
and
continued
copying
the
italics
in
websters
spelling
book
until
i
could
make
them
all
without
looking
on
the
book
by
this
time
my
little
master
thomas
had
gone
to
school
and
learned
how
to
write
and
had
written
over
a
number
of
copybooks
these
had
been
brought
home
and
shown
to
some
of
our
near
neighbors
and
then
laid
aside
my
mistress
used
to
go
to
class
meeting
at
the
wilk
street
meetinghouse
every
monday
afternoon
and
leave
me
to
take
care
of
the
house
when
left
thus
i
used
to
spend
the
time
in
writing
in
the
spaces
left
in
master
thomass
copybook
copying
what
he
had
written
i
continued
to
do
this
until
i
could
write
a
hand
very
similar
to
that
of
master
thomas
thus
after
a
long
tedious
effort
for
years
i
finally
succeeded
in
learning
how
to
write
chapter
viii
in
a
very
short
time
after
i
went
to
live
at
baltimore
my
old
masters
youngest
son
richard
died
and
in
about
three
years
and
six
months
after
his
death
my
old
master
captain
anthony
died
leavonly
his
son
andrew
and
daughter
lucretia
to
share
his
estate
he
died
while
on
a
visit
to
see
his
daughter
at
hillsborough
cut
off
thus
unexpectedly
he
left
no
will
as
to
the
disposal
of
his
property
it
was
therefore
necessary
to
have
a
valuation
of
the
property
that
it
might
be
equally
divided
between
mrs
lucretia
and
master
andrew
i
was
immediately
sent
for
to
be
valued
with
the
other
property
here
again
my
feelings
rose
up
in
detestation
of
slavery
i
had
now
a
new
conception
of
my
degraded
condition
prior
to
this
i
had
become
if
not
insensible
to
my
lot
at
least
partly
so
i
left
baltimore
with
a
young
heart
overborne
with
sadness
and
a
soul
full
of
apprehension
i
took
passage
with
captain
rowe
in
the
schooner
wild
cat
and
after
a
sail
of
about
twentyfour
hours
i
found
myself
near
the
place
of
my
birth
i
had
now
been
absent
from
it
almost
if
not
quite
five
years
i
however
remembered
the
place
very
well
i
was
only
about
five
years
old
when
i


left
it
to
go
and
live
with
my
old
master
on
colonel
lloyds
plantation
so
that
i
was
now
between
ten
and
eleven
years
old
we
were
all
ranked
together
at
the
valuation
men
and
women
old
and
young
married
and
single
were
ranked
with
horses
sheep
and
swine
there
were
horses
and
men
cattle
and
women
pigs
and
children
all
holding
the
same
rank
in
the
scale
of
being
and
were
all
subjected
to
the
same
narrow
examination
silveryheaded
age
and
sprightly
youth
maids
and
matrons
had
to
undergo
the
same
indelicate
inspection
at
this
moment
i
saw
more
clearly
than
ever
the
brutalizing
effects
of
slavery
upon
both
slave
and
slaveholder
after
the
valuation
then
came
the
division
i
have
no
language
to
express
the
high
excitement
and
deep
anxiety
which
were
felt
among
us
poor
slaves
during
this
time
our
fate
for
life
was
now
to
be
decided
we
had
no
more
voice
in
that
decision
than
the
brutes
among
whom
we
were
ranked
a
single
word
from
the
white
men
was
enoughagainst
all
our
wishes
prayers
and
entreatiesto
sunder
forever
the
dearest
friends
dearest
kindred
and
strongest
ties
known
to
human
beings
in
addition
to
the
pain
of
separation
there
was
the
horrid
dread
of
falling
into
the
hands
of
master
andrew
he
was
known
to
us
all
as
being
a
most
cruel
wretcha
common
drunkard
who
had
by
his
reckless
mismanagement
and
profligate
dissipation
already
wasted
a
large
portion
of
his
fathers
property
we
all
felt
that
we
might
as
well
be
sold
at
once
to
the
georgia
traders
as
to
pass
into
his
hands
for
we
knew
that
that
would
be
our
inevitable
conditiona
condition
held
by
us
all
in
the
utmost
horror
and
dread
i
suffered
more
anxiety
than
most
of
my
fellowslaves
i
had
known
what
it
was
to
be
kindly
treated
they
had
known
nothing
of
the
kind
they
had
seen
little
or
nothing
of
the
world
they
were
in
very
deed
men
and
women
of
sorrow
and
acquainted
with
grief
their
backs
had
been
made
familiar
with
the
bloody
lash
so
that
they
had
become
callous
mine
was
yet
tender
for
while
at
baltimore
i
got
few
whippings
and
few
slaves
could
boast
of
a
kinder
master
and
mistress
than
myself
and
the
thought
of
passing
out
of
their
hands
into
those
of
master
andrewa
man
who
but
a
few
days
before
to
give
me
a
sample
of
his
bloody
disposition
took
my
little
brother
by
the
throat
threw
him
on
the
ground
and
with
the
heel
of
his
boot
stamped
upon
his
head
till
the
blood
gushed
from
his
nose
and
earswas
well
calculated
to
make
me
anxious
as
to
my
fate
after
he
had
committed
this
savage
outrage
upon
my
brother
he
turned
to
me
and
said
that
was
the
way
he
meant
to
serve
me
one
of
these
daysmeaning
i
suppose
when
i
came
into
his
possession
thanks
to
a
kind
providence
i
fell
to
the
portion
of
mrs
lucretia
and
was
sent
immediately
back
to
baltimore
to
live
again
in
the
family
of
master
hugh
their
joy
at
my
return
equalled
their
sorrow
at
my
departure
it
was
a
glad
day
to
me
i
had
escaped
a
worse
than
lions
jaws
i
was
absent
from
baltimore
for
the
purpose
of
valuation
and
division
just
about
one
month
and
it
seemed
to
have
been
six
very
soon
after
my
return
to
baltimore
my
mistress
lucretia
died
leaving
her
husband
and
one
child
amanda
and
in
a
very
short
time
after
her
death
master
andrew
died
now
all
the
property
of
my
old
master
slaves
included
was
in
the
hands
of
strangersstrangers
who
had
had
nothing
to
do
with
accumulating
it
not
a
slave
was
left
free
all
remained
slaves
from
the
youngest
to
the
oldest
if
any
one
thing
in
my
experience
more
than
another

served
to
deepen
my
conviction
of
the
infernal
character
of
slavery
and
to
fill
me
with
unutterable
loathing
of
slaveholders
it
was
their
base
ingratitude
to
my
poor
old
grandmother
she
had
served
my
old
master
faithfully
from
youth
to
old
age
she
had
been
the
source
of
all
his
wealth
she
had
peopled
his
plantation
with
slaves
she
had
become
a
great
grandmother
in
his
service
she
had
rocked
him
in
infancy
attended
him
in
childhood
served
him
through
life
and
at
his
death
wiped
from
his
icy
brow
the
cold

in
about
two
years
after
the
death
of
mrs
lucretia
master
thomas
married
his
second
wife
her
name
was
rowena
hamilton
she
was
the
eldest
daughter
of
mr
william
hamilton
master
now
lived
in
st
michaels
not
long
after
his
marriage
a
misunderstanding
took
place
between
himself
and
master
hugh
and
as
a
means
of
punishing
his
brother
he
took
me
from
him
to
live
with
himself
at
st
michaels
here
i
underwent
another
most
painful
separation
it
however
was
not
so
severe
as
the
one
i
dreaded
at
the
division
of
property
for
during
this
interval
a
great
change
had
taken
place
in
master
hugh
and
his
once
kind
and
affectionate
wife
the
influence
of
brandy
upon
him
and
of
slavery
upon
her
had
effected
a
disastrous
change
in
the
characters
of
both
so
that
as
far
as
they
were
concerned
i
thought
i
had
little
to
lose
by
the
change
but
it
was
not
to
them
that
i
was
attached
it
was
to
those
little
baltimore
boys
that
i
felt
the
strongest
attachment
i
had
received
many
good
lessons
from
them
and
was
still
receiving
them
and
the
thought
of
leaving
them
was
painful
indeed
i
was
leaving
too
without
the
hope
of
ever
being
allowed
to
return
master
thomas
had
said
he
would
never
let
me
return
again
the
barrier
betwixt
himself
and
brother
he
considered
impassable
i
then
had
to
regret
that
i
did
not
at
least
make
the
attempt
to
carry
out
my
resolution
to
run
away
for
the
chances
of
success
are
tenfold
greater
from
the
city
than
from
the
country
i
sailed
from
baltimore
for
st
michaels
in
the
sloop
amanda
captain
edward
dodson
on
my
passage
i
paid
particular
attention
to
the
direction
which
the
steamboats
took
to
go
to
philadelphia
i
found
instead
of
going
down
on
reaching
north
point
they
went
up
the
bay
in
a
northeasterly
direction
i
deemed
this
knowledge
of
the
utmost
importance
my
determination
to
run
away
was
again
revived
i
resolved
to
wait
only
so
long
as
the
offering
of
a
favorable
opportunity
when
that
came
i
was
determined
to
be
off
chapter
ix
i
have
now
reached
a
period
of
my
life
when
i
can
give
dates
i
left
baltimore
and
went
to
live
with
master
thomas
auld
at
st
michaels
in
march

it
was
now
more
than
seven
years
since
i
lived
with
him
in
the
family
of
my
old
master
on
colonel
lloyds
plantation
we
of
course
were
now
almost
entire
strangers
to
each
other
he
was
to
me
a
new
master
and
i
to
him
a
new
slave
i
was
ignorant
of
his
temper
and
disposition
he
was
equally
so
of
mine
a
very
short
time
however
brought
us
into
full
acquaintance
with
each
other
i
was
made
acquainted
with
his
wife
not
less
than
with
himself
they
were
well
matched
being
equally
mean
and
cruel
i
was
now
for
the
first
time
during
a
space
of
more
than
seven
years
made
to
feel
the
painful
gnawings
of
hungera
something
which
i
had
not
experienced
before
since
i
left
colonel
lloyds
plantation
it
went
hard
enough
with
me
then
when
i
could
look
back
to
no


period
at
which
i
had
enjoyed
a
sufficiency
it
was
tenfold
harder
after
living
in
master
hughs
family
where
i
had
always
had
enough
to
eat
and
of
that
which
was
good
i
have
said
master
thomas
was
a
mean
man
he
was
so
not
to
give
a
slave
enough
to
eat
is
regarded
as
the
most
aggravated
development
of
meanness
even
among
slaveholders
the
rule
is
no
matter
how
coarse
the
food
only
let
there
be
enough
of
it
this
is
the
theory
and
in
the
part
of
maryland
from
which
i
came
it
is
the
general
practicethough
there
are
many
exceptions
master
thomas
gave
us
enough
of
neither
coarse
nor
fine
food
there
were
four
slaves
of
us
in
the
kitchenmy
sister
eliza
my
aunt
priscilla
henny
and
myself
and
we
were
allowed
less
than
a
half
of
a
bushel
of
cornmeal
per
week
and
very
little
else
either
in
the
shape
of
meat
or
vegetables
it
was
not
enough
for
us
to
subsist
upon
we
were
therefore
reduced
to
the
wretched
necessity
of
living
at
the
expense
of
our
neighbors
this
we
did
by
begging
and
stealing
whichever
came
handy
in
the
time
of
need
the
one
being
considered
as
legitimate
as
the
other
a
great
many
times
have
we
poor
creatures
been
nearly
perishing
with
hunger
when
food
in
abundance
lay
mouldering
in
the
safe
and
smokehouse
and
our
pious
mistress
was
aware
of
the
fact
and
yet
that
mistress
and
her
husband
would
kneel
every
morning
and
pray
that
god
would
bless
them
in
basket
and
store
bad
as
all
slaveholders
are
we
seldom
meet
one
destitute
of
every
element
of
character
commanding
respect
my
master
was
one
of
this
rare
sort
i
do
not
know
of
one
single
noble
act
ever
performed
by
him
the
leading
trait
in
his
character
was
meanness
and
if
there
were
any
other
element
in
his
nature
it
was
made
subject
to
this
he
was
mean
and
like
most
other
mean
men
he
lacked
the
ability
to
conceal
his
meanness
captain
auld
was
not
born
a
slaveholder
he
had
been
a
poor
man
master
only
of
a
bay
craft
he
came
into
possession
of
all
his
slaves
by
marriage
and
of
all
men
adopted
slaveholders
are
the
worst
he
was
cruel
but
cowardly
he
commanded
without
firmness
in
the
enforcement
of
his
rules
he
was
at
times
rigid
and
at
times
lax
at
times
he
spoke
to
his
slaves
with
the
firmness
of
napoleon
and
the
fury
of
a
demon
at
other
times
he
might
well
be
mistaken
for
an
inquirer
who
had
lost
his
way
he
did
nothing
of
himself
he
might
have
passed
for
a
lion
but
for
his
ears
in
all
things
noble
which
he
attempted
his
own
meanness
shone
most
conspicuous
his
airs
words
and
actions
were
the
airs
words
and
actions
of
born
slaveholders
and
being
assumed
were
awkward
enough
he
was
not
even
a
good
imitator
he
possessed
all
the
disposition
to
deceive
but
wanted
the
power
having
no
resources
within
himself
he
was
compelled
to
be
the
copyist
of
many
and
being
such
he
was
forever
the
victim
of
inconsistency
and
of
consequence
he
was
an
object
of
contempt
and
was
held
as
such
even
by
his
slaves
the
luxury
of
having
slaves
of
his
own
to
wait
upon
him
was
something
new
and
unprepared
for
he
was
a
slaveholder
without
the
ability
to
hold
slaves
he
found
himself
incapable
of
managing
his
slaves
either
by
force
fear
or
fraud
we
seldom
called
him
master
we
generally
called
him
captain
auld
and
were
hardly
disposed
to
title
him
at
all
i
doubt
not
that
our
conduct
had
much
to
do
with
making
him
appear
awkward
and
of
consequence
fretful
our
want
of
reverence
for
him
must
have
perplexed
him
greatly
he
wished
to
have
us
call
him
master
but
lacked
the
firmness
necessary
to
command
us
to
do
so
his
wife
used
to
insist
upon
our
calling
him
so
but
to
no
purpose
in
august

my

master
attended
a
methodist
campmeeting
held
in
the
bayside
talbot
county
and
there
experienced
religion
i
indulged
a
faint
hope
that
his
conversion
would
lead
him
to
emancipate
his
slaves
and
that
if
he
did
not
do
this
it
would
at
any
rate
make
him
more
kind
and
humane
i
was
disappointed
in
both
these
respects
it
neither
made
him
to
be
humane
to
his
slaves
nor
to
emancipate
them
if
it
had
any
effect
on
his
character
it
made
him
more
cruel
and
hateful
in
all
his
ways
for
i
believe
him
to
have
been
a
much
worse
man
after
his
conversion
than
before
prior
to
his
conversion
he
relied
upon
his
own
depravity
to
shield
and
sustain
him
in
his
savage
barbarity
but
after
his
conversion
he
found
religious
sanction
and
support
for
his
slaveholding
cruelty
he
made
the
greatest
pretensions
to
piety
his
house
was
the
house
of
prayer
he
prayed
morning
noon
and
night
he
very
soon
distinguished
himself
among
his
brethren
and
was
soon
made
a
classleader
and
exhorter
his
activity
in
revivals
was
great
and
he
proved
himself
an
instrument
in
the
hands
of
the
church
in
converting
many
souls
his
house
was
the
preachers
home
they
used
to
take
great
pleasure
in
coming
there
to
put
up
for
while
he
starved
us
he
stuffed
them
we
have
had
three
or
four
preachers
there
at
a
time
the
names
of
those
who
used
to
come
most
frequently
while
i
lived
there
were
mr
storks
mr
ewery
mr
humphry
and
mr
hickey
i
have
also
seen
mr
george
cookman
at
our
house
we
slaves
loved
mr
cookman
we
believed
him
to
be
a
good
man
we
thought
him
instrumental
in
getting
mr
samuel
harrison
a
very
rich
slaveholder
to
emancipate
his
slaves
and
by
some
means
got
the
impression
that
he
was
laboring
to
effect
the
emancipation
of
all
the
slaves
when
he
was
at
our
house
we
were
sure
to
be
called
in
to
prayers
when
the
others
were
there
we
were
sometimes
called
in
and
sometimes
not
mr
cookman
took
more
notice
of
us
than
either
of
the
other
ministers
he
could
not
come
among
us
without
betraying
his
sympathy
for
us
and
stupid
as
we
were
we
had
the
sagacity
to
see
it
while
i
lived
with
my
master
in
st
michaels
there
was
a
white
young
man
a
mr
wilson
who
proposed
to
keep
a
sabbath
school
for
the
instruction
of
such
slaves
as
might
be
disposed
to
learn
to
read
the
new
testament
we
met
but
three
times
when
mr
west
and
mr
fairbanks
both
classleaders
with
many
others
came
upon
us
with
sticks
and
other
missiles
drove
us
off
and
forbade
us
to
meet
again
thus
ended
our
little
sabbath
school
in
the
pious
town
of
st
michaels
i
have
said
my
master
found
religious
sanction
for
his
cruelty
as
an
example
i
will
state
one
of
many
facts
going
to
prove
the
charge
i
have
seen
him
tie
up
a
lame
young
woman
and
whip
her
with
a
heavy
cowskin
upon
her
naked
shoulders
causing
the
warm
red
blood
to
drip
and
in
justification
of
the
bloody
deed
he
would
quote
this
passage
of
scripturehe
that
knoweth
his
masters
will
and
doeth
it
not
shall
be
beaten
with
many
stripes
master
would
keep
this
lacerated
young
woman
tied
up
in
this
horrid
situation
four
or
five
hours
at
a
time
i
have
known
him
to
tie
her
up
early
in
the
morning
and
whip
her
before
breakfast
leave
her
go
to
his
store
return
at
dinner
and
whip
her
again
cutting
her
in
the
places
already
made
raw
with
his
cruel
lash
the
secret
of
masters
cruelty
toward
henny
is
found
in
the
fact
of
her
being
almost
helpless
when
quite
a
child
she
fell
into
the
fire
and
burned
herself
horribly
her
hands
were
so
burnt
that
she
never
got
the
use
of
them
she
could

do
very
little
but
bear
heavy
burdens
she
was
to
master
a
bill
of
expense
and
as
he
was
a
mean
man
she
was
a
constant
offence
to
him
he
seemed
desirous
of
getting
the
poor
girl
out
of
existence
he
gave
her
away
once
to
his
sister
but
being
a
poor
gift
she
was
not
disposed
to
keep
her
finally
my
benevolent
master
to
use
his
own
words
set
her
adrift
to
take
care
of
herself
here
was
a
recentlyconverted
man
holding
on
upon
the
mother
and
at
the
same
time
turning
out
her
helpless
child
to
starve
and
die
master
thomas
was
one
of
the
many
pious
slaveholders
who
hold
slaves
for
the
very
charitable
purpose
of
taking
care
of
them
my
master
and
myself
had
quite
a
number
of
differences
he
found
me
unsuitable
to
his
purpose
my
city
life
he
said
had
had
a
very
pernicious
effect
upon
me
it
had
almost
ruined
me
for
every
good
purpose
and
fitted
me
for
every
thing
which
was
bad
one
of
my
greatest
faults
was
that
of
letting
his
horse
run
away
and
go
down
to
his
fatherinlaws
farm
which
was
about
five
miles
from
st
michaels
i
would
then
have
to
go
after
it
my
reason
for
this
kind
of
carelessness
or
carefulness
was
that
i
could
always
get
something
to
eat
when
i
went
there
master
william
hamilton
my
masters
fatherinlaw
always
gave
his
slaves
enough
to
eat
i
never
left
there
hungry
no
matter
how
great
the
need
of
my
speedy
return
master
thomas
at
length
said
he
would
stand
it
no
longer
i
had
lived
with
him
nine
months
during
which
time
he
had
given
me
a
number
of
severe
whippings
all
to
no
good
purpose
he
resolved
to
put
me
out
as
he
said
to
be
broken
and
for
this
purpose
he
let
me
for
one
year
to
a
man
named
edward
covey
mr
covey
was
a
poor
man
a
farmrenter
he
rented
the
place
upon
which
he
lived
as
also
the
hands
with
which
he
tilled
it
mr
covey
had
acquired
a
very
high
reputation
for
breaking
young
slaves
and
this
reputation
was
of
immense
value
to
him
it
enabled
him
to
get
his
farm
tilled
with
much
less
expense
to
himself
than
he
could
have
had
it
done
without
such
a
reputation
some
slaveholders
thought
it
not
much
loss
to
allow
mr
covey
to
have
their
slaves
one
year
for
the
sake
of
the
training
to
which
they
were
subjected
without
any
other
compensation
he
could
hire
young
help
with
great
ease
in
consequence
of
this
reputation
added
to
the
natural
good
qualities
of
mr
covey
he
was
a
professor
of
religiona
pious
soula
member
and
a
class
leader
in
the
methodist
church
all
of
this
added
weight
to
his
reputation
as
a
niggerbreaker
i
was
aware
of
all
the
facts
having
been
made
acquainted
with
them
by
a
young
man
who
had
lived
there
i
nevertheless
made
the
change
gladly
for
i
was
sure
of
getting
enough
to
eat
which
is
not
the
smallest
consideration
to
a
hungry
man
chapter
x
i
had
left
master
thomass
house
and
went
to
live
with
mr
covey
on
the
st
of
january

i
was
now
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
a
field
hand
in
my
new
employment
i
found
myself
even
more
awkward
than
a
country
boy
appeared
to
be
in
a
large
city
i
had
been
at
my
new
home
but
one
week
before
mr
covey
gave
me
a
very
severe
whipping
cutting
my
back
causing
the
blood


to
run
and
raising
ridges
on
my
flesh
as
large
as
my
little
finger
the
details
of
this
affair
are
as
follows
mr
covey
sent
me
very
early
in
the
morning
of
one
of
our
coldest
days
in
the
month
of
january
to
the
woods
to
get
a
load
of
wood
he
gave
me
a
team
of
unbroken
oxen
he
told
me
which
was
the
inhand
ox
and
which
the
offhand
one
he
then
tied
the
end
of
a
large
rope
around
the
horns
of
the
inhand
ox
and
gave
me
the
other
end
of
it
and
told
me
if
the
oxen
started
to
run
that
i
must
hold
on
upon
the
rope
i
had
never
driven
oxen
before
and
of
course
i
was
very
awkward
i
however
succeeded
in
getting
to
the
edge
of
the
woods
with
little
difficulty
but
i
had
got
a
very
few
rods
into
the
woods
when
the
oxen
took
fright
and
started
full
tilt
carrying
the
cart
against
trees
and
over
stumps
in
the
most
frightful
manner
i
expected
every
moment
that
my
brains
would
be
dashed
out
against
the
trees
after
running
thus
for
a
considerable
distance
they
finally
upset
the
cart
dashing
it
with
great
force
against
a
tree
and
threw
themselves
into
a
dense
thicket
how
i
escaped
death
i
do
not
know
there
i
was
entirely
alone
in
a
thick
wood
in
a
place
new
to
me
my
cart
was
upset
and
shattered
my
oxen
were
entangled
among
the
young
trees
and
there
was
none
to
help
me
after
a
long
spell
of
effort
i
succeeded
in
getting
my
cart
righted
my
oxen
disentangled
and
again
yoked
to
the
cart
i
now
proceeded
with
my
team
to
the
place
where
i
had
the
day
before
been
chopping
wood
and
loaded
my
cart
pretty
heavily
thinking
in
this
way
to
tame
my
oxen
i
then
proceeded
on
my
way
home
i
had
now
consumed
one
half
of
the
day
i
got
out
of
the
woods
safely
and
now
felt
out
of
danger
i
stopped
my
oxen
to
open
the
woods
gate
and
just
as
i
did
so
before
i
could
get
hold
of
my
oxrope
the
oxen
again
started
rushed
through
the
gate
catching
it
between
the
wheel
and
the
body
of
the
cart
tearing
it
to
pieces
and
coming
within
a
few
inches
of
crushing
me
against
the
gatepost
thus
twice
in
one
short
day
i
escaped
death
by
the
merest
chance
on
my
return
i
told
mr
covey
what
had
happened
and
how
it
happened
he
ordered
me
to
return
to
the
woods
again
immediately
i
did
so
and
he
followed
on
after
me
just
as
i
got
into
the
woods
he
came
up
and
told
me
to
stop
my
cart
and
that
he
would
teach
me
how
to
trifle
away
my
time
and
break
gates
he
then
went
to
a
large
gumtree
and
with
his
axe
cut
three
large
switches
and
after
trimming
them
up
neatly
with
his
pocketknife
he
ordered
me
to
take
off
my
clothes
i
made
him
no
answer
but
stood
with
my
clothes
on
he
repeated
his
order
i
still
made
him
no
answer
nor
did
i
move
to
strip
myself
upon
this
he
rushed
at
me
with
the
fierceness
of
a
tiger
tore
off
my
clothes
and
lashed
me
till
he
had
worn
out
his
switches
cutting
me
so
savagely
as
to
leave
the
marks
visible
for
a
long
time
after
this
whipping
was
the
first
of
a
number
just
like
it
and
for
similar
offences
i
lived
with
mr
covey
one
year
during
the
first
six
months
of
that
year
scarce
a
week
passed
without
his
whipping
me
i
was
seldom
free
from
a
sore
back
my
awkwardness
was
almost
always
his
excuse
for
whipping
me
we
were
worked
fully
up
to
the
point
of
endurance
long
before
day
we
were
up
our
horses
fed
and
by
the
first
approach
of
day
we
were
off
to
the
field
with
our
hoes
and
ploughing
teams
mr
covey
gave
us
enough
to
eat
but
scarce
time
to
eat
it
we
were
often
less
than
five
minutes
taking
our
meals
we
were
often
in
the
field
from
the
first
approach
of
day
till
its
last
lingering
ray
had
left
us
and
at
savingfodder
time
midnight
often
caught
us
in
the
field
binding
blades

covey
would
be
out
with
us
the
way
he
used
to
stand
it
was
this
he
would
spend
the
most
of
his
afternoons
in
bed
he
would
then
come
out
fresh
in
the
evening
ready
to
urge
us
on
with
his
words
example
and
frequently
with
the
whip
mr
covey
was
one
of
the
few
slaveholders
who
could
and
did
work
with
his
hands
he
was
a
hardworking
man
he
knew
by
himself
just
what
a
man
or
a
boy
could
do
there
was
no
deceiving
him
his
work
went
on
in
his
absence
almost
as
well
as
in
his
presence
and
he
had
the
faculty
of
making
us
feel
that
he
was
ever
present
with
us
this
he
did
by
surprising
us
he
seldom
approached
the
spot
where
we
were
at
work
openly
if
he
could
do
it
secretly
he
always
aimed
at
taking
us
by
surprise
such
was
his
cunning
that
we
used
to
call
him
among
ourselves
the
snake
when
we
were
at
work
in
the
cornfield
he
would
sometimes
crawl
on
his
hands
and
knees
to
avoid
detection
and
all
at
once
he
would
rise
nearly
in
our
midst
and
scream
out
ha
ha
come
come
dash
on
dash
on
this
being
his
mode
of
attack
it
was
never
safe
to
stop
a
single
minute
his
comings
were
like
a
thief
in
the
night
he
appeared
to
us
as
being
ever
at
hand
he
was
under
every
tree
behind
every
stump
in
every
bush
and
at
every
window
on
the
plantation
he
would
sometimes
mount
his
horse
as
if
bound
to
st
michaels
a
distance
of
seven
miles
and
in
half
an
hour
afterwards
you
would
see
him
coiled
up
in
the
corner
of
the
woodfence
watching
every
motion
of
the
slaves
he
would
for
this
purpose
leave
his
horse
tied
up
in
the
woods
again
he
would
sometimes
walk
up
to
us
and
give
us
orders
as
though
he
was
upon
the
point
of
starting
on
a
long
journey
turn
his
back
upon
us
and
make
as
though
he
was
going
to
the
house
to
get
ready
and
before
he
would
get
half
way
thither
he
would
turn
short
and
crawl
into
a
fencecorner
or
behind
some
tree
and
there
watch
us
till
the
going
down
of
the
sun
mr
coveys
forte
consisted
in
his
power
to
deceive
his
life
was
devoted
to
planning
and
perpetrating
the
grossest
deceptions
every
thing
he
possessed
in
the
shape
of
learning
or
religion
he
made
conform
to
his
disposition
to
deceive
he
seemed
to
think
himself
equal
to
deceiving
the
almighty
he
would
make
a
short
prayer
in
the
morning
and
a
long
prayer
at
night
and
strange
as
it
may
seem
few
men
would
at
times
appear
more
devotional
than
he
the
exercises
of
his
family
devotions
were
always
commenced
with
singing
and
as
he
was
a
very
poor
singer
himself
the
duty
of
raising
the
hymn
generally
came
upon
me
he
would
read
his
hymn
and
nod
at
me
to
commence
i
would
at
times
do
so
at
others
i
would
not
my
non
compliance
would
almost
always
produce
much
confusion
to
show
himself
independent
of
me
he
would
start
and
stagger
through
with
his
hymn
in
the
most
discordant
manner
in
this
state
of
mind
he
prayed
with
more
than
ordinary
spirit
poor
man
such
was
his
disposition
and
success
at
deceiving
i
do
verily
believe
that
he
sometimes
deceived
himself
into
the
solemn
belief
that
he
was
a
sincere
worshipper
of
the
most
high
god
and
this
too
at
a
time
when
he
may
be
said
to
have
been
guilty
of
compelling
his
woman
slave
to
commit
the
sin
of
adultery
the
facts
in
the
case
are
these
mr
covey
was
a
poor
man
he
was
just
commencing
in
life
he
was
only
able
to
buy
one
slave
and
shocking
as
is
the
fact
he
bought
her
as
he
said
for
a
breeder
this
woman
was
named
caroline
mr
covey
bought
her
from
mr
thomas
lowe
about
six
miles
from
st
michaels
she
was
a
large
ablebodied
woman
about
twenty
years
old
she
had
already
given
birth
to
one
child
which
proved
her
to
be
just
what
he
wanted

after
buying
her
he
hired
a
married
man
of
mr
samuel
harrison
to
live
with
him
one
year
and
him
he
used
to
fasten
up
with
her
every
night
the
result
was
that
at
the
end
of
the
year
the
miserable
woman
gave
birth
to
twins
at
this
result
mr
covey
seemed
to
be
highly
pleased
both
with
the
man
and
the
wretched
woman
such
was
his
joy
and
that
of
his
wife
that
nothing
they
could
do
for
caroline
during
her
confinement
was
too
good
or
too
hard
to
be
done
the
children
were
regarded
as
being
quite
an
addition
to
his
wealth
if
at
any
one
time
of
my
life
more
than
another
i
was
made
to
drink
the
bitterest
dregs
of
slavery
that
time
was
during
the
first
six
months
of
my
stay
with
mr
covey
we
were
worked
in
all
weathers
it
was
never
too
hot
or
too
cold
it
could
never
rain
blow
hail
or
snow
too
hard
for
us
to
work
in
the
field
work
work
work
was
scarcely
more
the
order
of
the
day
than
of
the
night
the
longest
days
were
too
short
for
him
and
the
shortest
nights
too
long
for
him
i
was
somewhat
unmanageable
when
i
first
went
there
but
a
few
months
of
this
discipline
tamed
me
mr
covey
succeeded
in
breaking
me
i
was
broken
in
body
soul
and
spirit
my
natural
elasticity
was
crushed
my
intellect
languished
the
disposition
to
read
departed
the
cheerful
spark
that
lingered
about
my
eye
died
the
dark
night
of
slavery
closed
in
upon
me
and
behold
a
man
transformed
into
a
brute
sunday
was
my
only
leisure
time
i
spent
this
in
a
sort
of
beastlike
stupor
between
sleep
and
wake
under
some
large
tree
at
times
i
would
rise
up
a
flash
of
energetic
freedom
would
dart
through
my
soul
accompanied
with
a
faint
beam
of
hope
that
flickered
for
a
moment
and
then
vanished
i
sank
down
again
mourning
over
my
wretched
condition
i
was
sometimes
prompted
to
take
my
life
and
that
of
covey
but
was
prevented
by
a
combination
of
hope
and
fear
my
sufferings
on
this
plantation
seem
now
like
a
dream
rather
than
a
stern
reality
our
house
stood
within
a
few
rods
of
the
chesapeake
bay
whose
broad
bosom
was
ever
white
with
sails
from
every
quarter
of
the
habitable
globe
those
beautiful
vessels
robed
in
purest
white
so
delightful
to
the
eye
of
freemen
were
to
me
so
many
shrouded
ghosts
to
terrify
and
torment
me
with
thoughts
of
my
wretched
condition
i
have
often
in
the
deep
stillness
of
a
summers
sabbath
stood
all
alone
upon
the
lofty
banks
of
that
noble
bay
and
traced
with
saddened
heart
and
tearful
eye
the
countless
number
of
sails
moving
off
to
the
mighty
ocean
the
sight
of
these
always
affected
me
powerfully
my
thoughts
would
compel
utterance
and
there
with
no
audience
but
the
almighty
i
would
pour
out
my
souls
complaint
in
my
rude
way
with
an
apostrophe
to
the
moving
multitude
of
ships
you
are
loosed
from
your
moorings
and
are
free
i
am
fast
in
my
chains
and
am
a
slave
you
move
merrily
before
the
gentle
gale
and
i
sadly
before
the
bloody
whip
you
are
freedoms
swiftwinged
angels
that
fly
round
the
world
i
am
confined
in
bands
of
iron
o
that
i
were
free
o
that
i
were
on
one
of
your
gallant
decks
and
under
your
protecting
wing
alas
betwixt
me
and
you
the
turbid
waters
roll
go
on
go
on
o
that
i
could
also
go
could
i
but
swim
if
i
could
fly
o
why
was
i
born
a
man
of
whom
to
make
a
brute
the
glad
ship
is
gone
she
hides
in
the
dim
distance
i
am
left
in
the
hottest
hell
of
unending
slavery
o
god
save
me
god
deliver
me
let
me
be
free
is
there
any
god
why
am
i
a
slave
i
will
run
away
i
will
not
stand
it
get
caught
or
get
clear
ill
try
it

i
had
as
well
die
with
ague
as
the
fever
i
have
only
one
life
to
lose
i
had
as
well
be
killed
running
as
die
standing
only
think
of
it
one
hundred
miles
straight
north
and
i
am
free
try
it
yes
god
helping
me
i
will
it
cannot
be
that
i
shall
live
and
die
a
slave
i
will
take
to
the
water
this
very
bay
shall
yet
bear
me
into
freedom
the
steamboats
steered
in
a
northeast
course
from
north
point
i
will
do
the
same
and
when
i
get
to
the
head
of
the
bay
i
will
turn
my
canoe
adrift
and
walk
straight
through
delaware
into
pennsylvania
when
i
get
there
i
shall
not
be
required
to
have
a
pass
i
can
travel
without
being
disturbed
let
but
the
first
opportunity
offer
and
come
what
will
i
am
off
meanwhile
i
will
try
to
bear
up
under
the
yoke
i
am
not
the
only
slave
in
the
world
why
should
i
fret
i
can
bear
as
much
as
any
of
them
besides
i
am
but
a
boy
and
all
boys
are
bound
to
some
one
it
may
be
that
my
misery
in
slavery
will
only
increase
my
happiness
when
i
get
free
there
is
a
better
day
coming
thus
i
used
to
think
and
thus
i
used
to
speak
to
myself
goaded
almost
to
madness
at
one
moment
and
at
the
next
reconciling
myself
to
my
wretched
lot
i
have
already
intimated
that
my
condition
was
much
worse
during
the
first
six
months
of
my
stay
at
mr
coveys
than
in
the
last
six
the
circumstances
leading
to
the
change
in
mr
coveys
course
toward
me
form
an
epoch
in
my
humble
history
you
have
seen
how
a
man
was
made
a
slave
you
shall
see
how
a
slave
was
made
a
man
on
one
of
the
hottest
days
of
the
month
of
august

bill
smith
william
hughes
a
slave
named
eli
and
myself
were
engaged
in
fanning
wheat
hughes
was
clearing
the
fanned
wheat
from
before
the
fan
eli
was
turning
smith
was
feeding
and
i
was
carrying
wheat
to
the
fan
the
work
was
simple
requiring
strength
rather
than
intellect
yet
to
one
entirely
unused
to
such
work
it
came
very
hard
about
three
oclock
of
that
day
i
broke
down
my
strength
failed
me
i
was
seized
with
a
violent
aching
of
the
head
attended
with
extreme
dizziness
i
trembled
in
every
limb
finding
what
was
coming
i
nerved
myself
up
feeling
it
would
never
do
to
stop
work
i
stood
as
long
as
i
could
stagger
to
the
hopper
with
grain
when
i
could
stand
no
longer
i
fell
and
felt
as
if
held
down
by
an
immense
weight
the
fan
of
course
stopped
every
one
had
his
own
work
to
do
and
no
one
could
do
the
work
of
the
other
and
have
his
own
go
on
at
the
same
time
mr
covey
was
at
the
house
about
one
hundred
yards
from
the
treadingyard
where
we
were
fanning
on
hearing
the
fan
stop
he
left
immediately
and
came
to
the
spot
where
we
were
he
hastily
inquired
what
the
matter
was
bill
answered
that
i
was
sick
and
there
was
no
one
to
bring
wheat
to
the
fan
i
had
by
this
time
crawled
away
under
the
side
of
the
post
and
railfence
by
which
the
yard
was
enclosed
hoping
to
find
relief
by
getting
out
of
the
sun
he
then
asked
where
i
was
he
was
told
by
one
of
the
hands
he
came
to
the
spot
and
after
looking
at
me
awhile
asked
me
what
was
the
matter
i
told
him
as
well
as
i
could
for
i
scarce
had
strength
to
speak
he
then
gave
me
a
savage
kick
in
the
side
and
told
me
to
get
up
i
tried
to
do
so
but
fell
back
in
the
attempt
he
gave
me
another
kick
and
again
told
me
to
rise
i
again
tried
and
succeeded
in
gaining
my
feet
but
stooping
to
get
the
tub
with
which
i
was
feeding
the
fan
i
again
staggered
and
fell
while
down
in
this
situation
mr
covey
took
up
the
hickory
slat
with
which
hughes
had
been
striking
off
the
half
bushel
measure
and
with
it
gave
me
a
heavy
blow
upon
the
head
making
a

large
wound
and
the
blood
ran
freely
and
with
this
again
told
me
to
get
up
i
made
no
effort
to
comply
having
now
made
up
my
mind
to
let
him
do
his
worst
in
a
short
time
after
receiving
this
blow
my
head
grew
better
mr
covey
had
now
left
me
to
my
fate
at
this
moment
i
resolved
for
the
first
time
to
go
to
my
master
enter
a
complaint
and
ask
his
protection
in
order
to
do
this
i
must
that
afternoon
walk
seven
miles
and
this
under
the
circumstances
was
truly
a
severe
undertaking
i
was
exceedingly
feeble
made
so
as
much
by
the
kicks
and
blows
which
i
received
as
by
the
severe
fit
of
sickness
to
which
i
had
been
subjected
i
however
watched
my
chance
while
covey
was
looking
in
an
opposite
direction
and
started
for
st
michaels
i
succeeded
in
getting
a
considerable
distance
on
my
way
to
the
woods
when
covey
discovered
me
and
called
after
me
to
come
back
threatening
what
he
would
do
if
i
did
not
come
i
disregarded
both
his
calls
and
his
threats
and
made
my
way
to
the
woods
as
fast
as
my
feeble
state
would
allow
and
thinking
i
might
be
overhauled
by
him
if
i
kept
the
road
i
walked
through
the
woods
keeping
far
enough
from
the
road
to
avoid
detection
and
near
enough
to
prevent
losing
my
way
i
had
not
gone
far
before
my
little
strength
again
failed
me
i
could
go
no
farther
i
fell
down
and
lay
for
a
considerable
time
the
blood
was
yet
oozing
from
the
wound
on
my
head
for
a
time
i
thought
i
should
bleed
to
death
and
think
now
that
i
should
have
done
so
but
that
the
blood
so
matted
my
hair
as
to
stop
the
wound
after
lying
there
about
three
quarters
of
an
hour
i
nerved
myself
up
again
and
started
on
my
way
through
bogs
and
briers
barefooted
and
bareheaded
tearing
my
feet
sometimes
at
nearly
every
step
and
after
a
journey
of
about
seven
miles
occupying
some
five
hours
to
perform
it
i
arrived
at
masters
store
i
then
presented
an
appearance
enough
to
affect
any
but
a
heart
of
iron
from
the
crown
of
my
head
to
my
feet
i
was
covered
with
blood
my
hair
was
all
clotted
with
dust
and
blood
my
shirt
was
stiff
with
blood
i
suppose
i
looked
like
a
man
who
had
escaped
a
den
of
wild
beasts
and
barely
escaped
them
in
this
state
i
appeared
before
my
master
humbly
entreating
him
to
interpose
his
authority
for
my
protection
i
told
him
all
the
circumstances
as
well
as
i
could
and
it
seemed
as
i
spoke
at
times
to
affect
him
he
would
then
walk
the
floor
and
seek
to
justify
covey
by
saying
he
expected
i
deserved
it
he
asked
me
what
i
wanted
i
told
him
to
let
me
get
a
new
home
that
as
sure
as
i
lived
with
mr
covey
again
i
should
live
with
but
to
die
with
him
that
covey
would
surely
kill
me
he
was
in
a
fair
way
for
it
master
thomas
ridiculed
the
idea
that
there
was
any
danger
of
mr
coveys
killing
me
and
said
that
he
knew
mr
covey
that
he
was
a
good
man
and
that
he
could
not
think
of
taking
me
from
him
that
should
he
do
so
he
would
lose
the
whole
years
wages
that
i
belonged
to
mr
covey
for
one
year
and
that
i
must
go
back
to
him
come
what
might
and
that
i
must
not
trouble
him
with
any
more
stories
or
that
he
would
himself
get
hold
of
me
after
threatening
me
thus
he
gave
me
a
very
large
dose
of
salts
telling
me
that
i
might
remain
in
st
michaels
that
night
it
being
quite
late
but
that
i
must
be
off
back
to
mr
coveys
early
in
the
morning
and
that
if
i
did
not
he
would
get
hold
of
me
which
meant
that
he
would
whip
me
i
remained
all
night
and
according
to
his
orders
i
started
off
to
coveys
in
the
morning
saturday
morning
wearied
in
body
and
broken
in
spirit
i
got
no
supper
that
night
or
breakfast
that
morning
i
reached
coveys
about
nine
oclock
and
just
as
i
was
getting
over
the
fence
that
divided
mrs
kemps
fields
from
ours
out
ran
covey
with
his
cowskin

to
give
me
another
whipping
before
he
could
reach
me
i
succeeded
in
getting
to
the
cornfield
and
as
the
corn
was
very
high
it
afforded
me
the
means
of
hiding
he
seemed
very
angry
and
searched
for
me
a
long
time
my
behavior
was
altogether
unaccountable
he
finally
gave
up
the
chase
thinking
i
suppose
that
i
must
come
home
for
something
to
eat
he
would
give
himself
no
further
trouble
in
looking
for
me
i
spent
that
day
mostly
in
the
woods
having
the
alternative
before
meto
go
home
and
be
whipped
to
death
or
stay
in
the
woods
and
be
starved
to
death
that
night
i
fell
in
with
sandy
jenkins
a
slave
with
whom
i
was
somewhat
acquainted
sandy
had
a
free
wife
who
lived
about
four
miles
from
mr
coveys
and
it
being
saturday
he
was
on
his
way
to
see
her
i
told
him
my
circumstances
and
he
very
kindly
invited
me
to
go
home
with
him
i
went
home
with
him
and
talked
this
whole
matter
over
and
got
his
advice
as
to
what
course
it
was
best
for
me
to
pursue
i
found
sandy
an
old
adviser
he
told
me
with
great
solemnity
i
must
go
back
to
covey
but
that
before
i
went
i
must
go
with
him
into
another
part
of
the
woods
where
there
was
a
certain
root
which
if
i
would
take
some
of
it
with
me
carrying
it
always
on
my
right
side
would
render
it
impossible
for
mr
covey
or
any
other
white
man
to
whip
me
he
said
he
had
carried
it
for
years
and
since
he
had
done
so
he
had
never
received
a
blow
and
never
expected
to
while
he
carried
it
i
at
first
rejected
the
idea
that
the
simple
carrying
of
a
root
in
my
pocket
would
have
any
such
effect
as
he
had
said
and
was
not
disposed
to
take
it
but
sandy
impressed
the
necessity
with
much
earnestness
telling
me
it
could
do
no
harm
if
it
did
no
good
to
please
him
i
at
length
took
the
root
and
according
to
his
direction
carried
it
upon
my
right
side
this
was
sunday
morning
i
immediately
started
for
home
and
upon
entering
the
yard
gate
out
came
mr
covey
on
his
way
to
meeting
he
spoke
to
me
very
kindly
bade
me
drive
the
pigs
from
a
lot
near
by
and
passed
on
towards
the
church
now
this
singular
conduct
of
mr
covey
really
made
me
begin
to
think
that
there
was
something
in
the
root
which
sandy
had
given
me
and
had
it
been
on
any
other
day
than
sunday
i
could
have
attributed
the
conduct
to
no
other
cause
than
the
influence
of
that
root
and
as
it
was
i
was
half
inclined
to
think
the
root
to
be
something
more
than
i
at
first
had
taken
it
to
be
all
went
well
till
monday
morning
on
this
morning
the
virtue
of
the
root
was
fully
tested
long
before
daylight
i
was
called
to
go
and
rub
curry
and
feed
the
horses
i
obeyed
and
was
glad
to
obey
but
whilst
thus
engaged
whilst
in
the
act
of
throwing
down
some
blades
from
the
loft
mr
covey
entered
the
stable
with
a
long
rope
and
just
as
i
was
half
out
of
the
loft
he
caught
hold
of
my
legs
and
was
about
tying
me
as
soon
as
i
found
what
he
was
up
to
i
gave
a
sudden
spring
and
as
i
did
so
he
holding
to
my
legs
i
was
brought
sprawling
on
the
stable
floor
mr
covey
seemed
now
to
think
he
had
me
and
could
do
what
he
pleased
but
at
this
momentfrom
whence
came
the
spirit
i
dont
knowi
resolved
to
fight
and
suiting
my
action
to
the
resolution
i
seized
covey
hard
by
the
throat
and
as
i
did
so
i
rose
he
held
on
to
me
and
i
to
him
my
resistance
was
so
entirely
unexpected
that
covey
seemed
taken
all
aback
he
trembled
like
a
leaf
this
gave
me
assurance
and
i
held
him
uneasy
causing
the
blood
to
run
where
i
touched
him
with
the
ends
of
my
fingers
mr
covey
soon
called
out
to
hughes
for
help
hughes
came
and
while
covey
held
me
attempted
to
tie
my
right
hand
while
he
was
in
the
act
of
doing
so
i
watched
my
chance
and
gave
him
a
heavy
kick
close
under
the
ribs
this
kick
fairly
sickened
hughes
so
that

he
left
me
in
the
hands
of
mr
covey
this
kick
had
the
effect
of
not
only
weakening
hughes
but
covey
also
when
he
saw
hughes
bending
over
with
pain
his
courage
quailed
he
asked
me
if
i
meant
to
persist
in
my
resistance
i
told
him
i
did
come
what
might
that
he
had
used
me
like
a
brute
for
six
months
and
that
i
was
determined
to
be
used
so
no
longer
with
that
he
strove
to
drag
me
to
a
stick
that
was
lying
just
out
of
the
stable
door
he
meant
to
knock
me
down
but
just
as
he
was
leaning
over
to
get
the
stick
i
seized
him
with
both
hands
by
his
collar
and
brought
him
by
a
sudden
snatch
to
the
ground
by
this
time
bill
came
covey
called
upon
him
for
assistance
bill
wanted
to
know
what
he
could
do
covey
said
take
hold
of
him
take
hold
of
him
bill
said
his
master
hired
him
out
to
work
and
not
to
help
to
whip
me
so
he
left
covey
and
myself
to
fight
our
own
battle
out
we
were
at
it
for
nearly
two
hours
covey
at
length
let
me
go
puffing
and
blowing
at
a
great
rate
saying
that
if
i
had
not
resisted
he
would
not
have
whipped
me
half
so
much
the
truth
was
that
he
had
not
whipped
me
at
all
i
considered
him
as
getting
entirely
the
worst
end
of
the
bargain
for
he
had
drawn
no
blood
from
me
but
i
had
from
him
the
whole
six
months
afterwards
that
i
spent
with
mr
covey
he
never
laid
the
weight
of
his
finger
upon
me
in
anger
he
would
occasionally
say
he
didnt
want
to
get
hold
of
me
again
no
thought
i
you
need
not
for
you
will
come
off
worse
than
you
did
before
this
battle
with
mr
covey
was
the
turningpoint
in
my
career
as
a
slave
it
rekindled
the
few
expiring
embers
of
freedom
and
revived
within
me
a
sense
of
my
own
manhood
it
recalled
the
departed
selfconfidence
and
inspired
me
again
with
a
determination
to
be
free
the
gratification
afforded
by
the
triumph
was
a
full
compensation
for
whatever
else
might
follow
even
death
itself
he
only
can
understand
the
deep
satisfaction
which
i
experienced
who
has
himself
repelled
by
force
the
bloody
arm
of
slavery
i
felt
as
i
never
felt
before
it
was
a
glorious
resurrection
from
the
tomb
of
slavery
to
the
heaven
of
freedom
my
longcrushed
spirit
rose
cowardice
departed
bold
defiance
took
its
place
and
i
now
resolved
that
however
long
i
might
remain
a
slave
in
form
the
day
had
passed
forever
when
i
could
be
a
slave
in
fact
i
did
not
hesitate
to
let
it
be
known
of
me
that
the
white
man
who
expected
to
succeed
in
whipping
must
also
succeed
in
killing
me
from
this
time
i
was
never
again
what
might
be
called
fairly
whipped
though
i
remained
a
slave
four
years
afterwards
i
had
several
fights
but
was
never
whipped
it
was
for
a
long
time
a
matter
of
surprise
to
me
why
mr
covey
did
not
immediately
have
me
taken
by
the
constable
to
the
whippingpost
and
there
regularly
whipped
for
the
crime
of
raising
my
hand
against
a
white
man
in
defence
of
myself
and
the
only
explanation
i
can
now
think
of
does
not
entirely
satisfy
me
but
such
as
it
is
i
will
give
it
mr
covey
enjoyed
the
most
unbounded
reputation
for
being
a
firstrate
overseer
and
negrobreaker
it
was
of
considerable
importance
to
him
that
reputation
was
at
stake
and
had
he
sent
mea
boy
about
sixteen
years
oldto
the
public
whippingpost
his
reputation
would
have
been
lost
so
to
save
his
reputation
he
suffered
me
to
go
unpunished
my
term
of
actual
service
to
mr
edward
covey
ended
on
christmas
day

the
days
between
christmas
and
new
years
day
are
allowed
as

holidays
and
accordingly
we
were
not
required
to
perform
any
labor
more
than
to
feed
and
take
care
of
the
stock
this
time
we
regarded
as
our
own
by
the
grace
of
our
masters
and
we
therefore
used
or
abused
it
nearly
as
we
pleased
those
of
us
who
had
families
at
a
distance
were
generally
allowed
to
spend
the
whole
six
days
in
their
society
this
time
however
was
spent
in
various
ways
the
staid
sober
thinking
and
industrious
ones
of
our
number
would
employ
themselves
in
making
cornbrooms
mats
horsecollars
and
baskets
and
another
class
of
us
would
spend
the
time
in
hunting
opossums
hares
and
coons
but
by
far
the
larger
part
engaged
in
such
sports
and
merriments
as
playing
ball
wrestling
running
footraces
fiddling
dancing
and
drinking
whisky
and
this
latter
mode
of
spending
the
time
was
by
far
the
most
agreeable
to
the
feelings
of
our
masters
a
slave
who
would
work
during
the
holidays
was
considered
by
our
masters
as
scarcely
deserving
them
he
was
regarded
as
one
who
rejected
the
favor
of
his
master
it
was
deemed
a
disgrace
not
to
get
drunk
at
christmas
and
he
was
regarded
as
lazy
indeed
who
had
not
provided
himself
with
the
necessary
means
during
the
year
to
get
whisky
enough
to
last
him
through
christmas
from
what
i
know
of
the
effect
of
these
holidays
upon
the
slave
i
believe
them
to
be
among
the
most
effective
means
in
the
hands
of
the
slaveholder
in
keeping
down
the
spirit
of
insurrection
were
the
slaveholders
at
once
to
abandon
this
practice
i
have
not
the
slightest
doubt
it
would
lead
to
an
immediate
insurrection
among
the
slaves
these
holidays
serve
as
conductors
or
safetyvalves
to
carry
off
the
rebellious
spirit
of
enslaved
humanity
but
for
these
the
slave
would
be
forced
up
to
the
wildest
desperation
and
woe
betide
the
slaveholder
the
day
he
ventures
to
remove
or
hinder
the
operation
of
those
conductors
i
warn
him
that
in
such
an
event
a
spirit
will
go
forth
in
their
midst
more
to
be
dreaded
than
the
most
appalling
earthquake
the
holidays
are
part
and
parcel
of
the
gross
fraud
wrong
and
inhumanity
of
slavery
they
are
professedly
a
custom
established
by
the
benevolence
of
the
slaveholders
but
i
undertake
to
say
it
is
the
result
of
selfishness
and
one
of
the
grossest
frauds
committed
upon
the
downtrodden
slave
they
do
not
give
the
slaves
this
time
because
they
would
not
like
to
have
their
work
during
its
continuance
but
because
they
know
it
would
be
unsafe
to
deprive
them
of
it
this
will
be
seen
by
the
fact
that
the
slaveholders
like
to
have
their
slaves
spend
those
days
just
in
such
a
manner
as
to
make
them
as
glad
of
their
ending
as
of
their
beginning
their
object
seems
to
be
to
disgust
their
slaves
with
freedom
by
plunging
them
into
the
lowest
depths
of
dissipation
for
instance
the
slaveholders
not
only
like
to
see
the
slave
drink
of
his
own
accord
but
will
adopt
various
plans
to
make
him
drunk
one
plan
is
to
make
bets
on
their
slaves
as
to
who
can
drink
the
most
whisky
without
getting
drunk
and
in
this
way
they
succeed
in
getting
whole
multitudes
to
drink
to
excess
thus
when
the
slave
asks
for
virtuous
freedom
the
cunning
slaveholder
knowing
his
ignorance
cheats
him
with
a
dose
of
vicious
dissipation
artfully
labelled
with
the
name
of
liberty
the
most
of
us
used
to
drink
it
down
and
the
result
was
just
what
might
be
supposed
many
of
us
were
led
to
think
that
there
was
little
to
choose
between
liberty
and
slavery
we
felt
and
very
properly
too
that
we
had
almost
as
well
be
slaves
to
man
as
to
rum
so
when
the
holidays
ended
we
staggered
up
from
the
filth
of
our
wallowing
took
a
long
breath
and
marched
to

the
fieldfeeling
upon
the
whole
rather
glad
to
go
from
what
our
master
had
deceived
us
into
a
belief
was
freedom
back
to
the
arms
of
slavery
i
have
said
that
this
mode
of
treatment
is
a
part
of
the
whole
system
of
fraud
and
inhumanity
of
slavery
it
is
so
the
mode
here
adopted
to
disgust
the
slave
with
freedom
by
allowing
him
to
see
only
the
abuse
of
it
is
carried
out
in
other
things
for
instance
a
slave
loves
molasses
he
steals
some
his
master
in
many
cases
goes
off
to
town
and
buys
a
large
quantity
he
returns
takes
his
whip
and
commands
the
slave
to
eat
the
molasses
until
the
poor
fellow
is
made
sick
at
the
very
mention
of
it
the
same
mode
is
sometimes
adopted
to
make
the
slaves
refrain
from
asking
for
more
food
than
their
regular
allowance
a
slave
runs
through
his
allowance
and
applies
for
more
his
master
is
enraged
at
him
but
not
willing
to
send
him
off
without
food
gives
him
more
than
is
necessary
and
compels
him
to
eat
it
within
a
given
time
then
if
he
complains
that
he
cannot
eat
it
he
is
said
to
be
satisfied
neither
full
nor
fasting
and
is
whipped
for
being
hard
to
please
i
have
an
abundance
of
such
illustrations
of
the
same
principle
drawn
from
my
own
observation
but
think
the
cases
i
have
cited
sufficient
the
practice
is
a
very
common
one
on
the
first
of
january

i
left
mr
covey
and
went
to
live
with
mr
william
freeland
who
lived
about
three
miles
from
st
michaels
i
soon
found
mr
freeland
a
very
different
man
from
mr
covey
though
not
rich
he
was
what
would
be
called
an
educated
southern
gentleman
mr
covey
as
i
have
shown
was
a
welltrained
negrobreaker
and
slavedriver
the
former
slaveholder
though
he
was
seemed
to
possess
some
regard
for
honor
some
reverence
for
justice
and
some
respect
for
humanity
the
latter
seemed
totally
insensible
to
all
such
sentiments
mr
freeland
had
many
of
the
faults
peculiar
to
slaveholders
such
as
being
very
passionate
and
fretful
but
i
must
do
him
the
justice
to
say
that
he
was
exceedingly
free
from
those
degrading
vices
to
which
mr
covey
was
constantly
addicted
the
one
was
open
and
frank
and
we
always
knew
where
to
find
him
the
other
was
a
most
artful
deceiver
and
could
be
understood
only
by
such
as
were
skilful
enough
to
detect
his
cunninglydevised
frauds
another
advantage
i
gained
in
my
new
master
was
he
made
no
pretensions
to
or
profession
of
religion
and
this
in
my
opinion
was
truly
a
great
advantage
i
assert
most
unhesitatingly
that
the
religion
of
the
south
is
a
mere
covering
for
the
most
horrid
crimesa
justifier
of
the
most
appalling
barbaritya
sanctifier
of
the
most
hateful
fraudsand
a
dark
shelter
under
which
the
darkest
foulest
grossest
and
most
infernal
deeds
of
slaveholders
find
the
strongest
protection
were
i
to
be
again
reduced
to
the
chains
of
slavery
next
to
that
enslavement
i
should
regard
being
the
slave
of
a
religious
master
the
greatest
calamity
that
could
befall
me
for
of
all
slaveholders
with
whom
i
have
ever
met
religious
slaveholders
are
the
worst
i
have
ever
found
them
the
meanest
and
basest
the
most
cruel
and
cowardly
of
all
others
it
was
my
unhappy
lot
not
only
to
belong
to
a
religious
slaveholder
but
to
live
in
a
community
of
such
religionists
very
near
mr
freeland
lived
the
rev
daniel
weeden
and
in
the
same
neighborhood
lived
the
rev
rigby
hopkins
these
were
members
and
ministers
in
the
reformed
methodist
church
mr
weeden
owned
among
others
a
woman
slave
whose
name
i
have
forgotten
this
womans
back
for
weeks
was
kept
literally
raw
made
so
by
the
lash
of
this
merciless
religious
wretch
he
used
to
hire
hands
his
maxim
was
behave

well
or
behave
ill
it
is
the
duty
of
a
master
occasionally
to
whip
a
slave
to
remind
him
of
his
masters
authority
such
was
his
theory
and
such
his
practice
mr
hopkins
was
even
worse
than
mr
weeden
his
chief
boast
was
his
ability
to
manage
slaves
the
peculiar
feature
of
his
government
was
that
of
whipping
slaves
in
advance
of
deserving
it
he
always
managed
to
have
one
or
more
of
his
slaves
to
whip
every
monday
morning
he
did
this
to
alarm
their
fears
and
strike
terror
into
those
who
escaped
his
plan
was
to
whip
for
the
smallest
offences
to
prevent
the
commission
of
large
ones
mr
hopkins
could
always
find
some
excuse
for
whipping
a
slave
it
would
astonish
one
unaccustomed
to
a
slaveholding
life
to
see
with
what
wonderful
ease
a
slaveholder
can
find
things
of
which
to
make
occasion
to
whip
a
slave
a
mere
look
word
or
motiona
mistake
accident
or
want
of
powerare
all
matters
for
which
a
slave
may
be
whipped
at
any
time
does
a
slave
look
dissatisfied
it
is
said
he
has
the
devil
in
him
and
it
must
be
whipped
out
does
he
speak
loudly
when
spoken
to
by
his
master
then
he
is
getting
highminded
and
should
be
taken
down
a
buttonhole
lower
does
he
forget
to
pull
off
his
hat
at
the
approach
of
a
white
person
then
he
is
wanting
in
reverence
and
should
be
whipped
for
it
does
he
ever
venture
to
vindicate
his
conduct
when
censured
for
it
then
he
is
guilty
of
impudenceone
of
the
greatest
crimes
of
which
a
slave
can
be
guilty
does
he
ever
venture
to
suggest
a
different
mode
of
doing
things
from
that
pointed
out
by
his
master
he
is
indeed
presumptuous
and
getting
above
himself
and
nothing
less
than
a
flogging
will
do
for
him
does
he
while
ploughing
break
a
ploughor
while
hoeing
break
a
hoe
it
is
owing
to
his
carelessness
and
for
it
a
slave
must
always
be
whipped
mr
hopkins
could
always
find
something
of
this
sort
to
justify
the
use
of
the
lash
and
he
seldom
failed
to
embrace
such
opportunities
there
was
not
a
man
in
the
whole
county
with
whom
the
slaves
who
had
the
getting
their
own
home
would
not
prefer
to
live
rather
than
with
this
rev
mr
hopkins
and
yet
there
was
not
a
man
any
where
round
who
made
higher
professions
of
religion
or
was
more
active
in
revivalsmore
attentive
to
the
class
lovefeast
prayer
and
preaching
meetings
or
more
devotional
in
his
familythat
prayed

louder
and
longer
than
this
same
reverend
slavedriver
rigby
hopkins
but
to
return
to
mr
freeland
and
to
my
experience
while
in
his
employment
he
like
mr
covey
gave
us
enough
to
eat
but
unlike
mr
covey
he
also
gave
us
sufficient
time
to
take
our
meals
he
worked
us
hard
but
always
between
sunrise
and
sunset
he
required
a
good
deal
of
work
to
be
done
but
gave
us
good
tools
with
which
to
work
his
farm
was
large
but
he
employed
hands
enough
to
work
it
and
with
ease
compared
with
many
of
his
neighbors
my
treatment
while
in
his
employment
was
heavenly
compared
with
what
i
experienced
at
the
hands
of
mr
edward
covey
mr
freeland
was
himself
the
owner
of
but
two
slaves
their
names
were
henry
harris
and
john
harris
the
rest
of
his
hands
he
hired
these
consisted
of
myself
sandy
jenkins
and
handy
caldwell
henry
and
john
were
quite
this
is
the
same
man
who
gave
me
the
roots
to
prevent
my
being
whipped
by
mr
covey
he
was
a
clever
soul
we
used
frequently
to
talk
about
the
fight
with
covey
and
as
often
as
we
did
so
he
would
claim
my
success
as
the
result
of
the
roots
which
he
gave
me
this
superstition
is
very
common
among
the
more
ignorant
slaves
a
slave
seldom
dies
but
that
his
death
is
attributed
to
trickery

intelligent
and
in
a
very
little
while
after
i
went
there
i
succeeded
in
creating
in
them
a
strong
desire
to
learn
how
to
read
this
desire
soon
sprang
up
in
the
others
also
they
very
soon
mustered
up
some
old
spellingbooks
and
nothing
would
do
but
that
i
must
keep
a
sabbath
school
i
agreed
to
do
so
and
accordingly
devoted
my
sundays
to
teaching
these
my
loved
fellowslaves
how
to
read
neither
of
them
knew
his
letters
when
i
went
there
some
of
the
slaves
of
the
neighboring
farms
found
what
was
going
on
and
also
availed
themselves
of
this
little
opportunity
to
learn
to
read
it
was
understood
among
all
who
came
that
there
must
be
as
little
display
about
it
as
possible
it
was
necessary
to
keep
our
religious
masters
at
st
michaels
unacquainted
with
the
fact
that
instead
of
spending
the
sabbath
in
wrestling
boxing
and
drinking
whisky
we
were
trying
to
learn
how
to
read
the
will
of
god
for
they
had
much
rather
see
us
engaged
in
those
degrading
sports
than
to
see
us
behaving
like
intellectual
moral
and
accountable
beings
my
blood
boils
as
i
think
of
the
bloody
manner
in
which
messrs
wright
fairbanks
and
garrison
west
both
classleaders
in
connection
with
many
others
rushed
in
upon
us
with
sticks
and
stones
and
broke
up
our
virtuous
little
sabbath
school
at
st
michaelsall
calling
themselves
christians
humble
followers
of
the
lord
jesus
christ
but
i
am
again
digressing
i
held
my
sabbath
school
at
the
house
of
a
free
colored
man
whose
name
i
deem
it
imprudent
to
mention
for
should
it
be
known
it
might
embarrass
him
greatly
though
the
crime
of
holding
the
school
was
committed
ten
years
ago
i
had
at
one
time
over
forty
scholars
and
those
of
the
right
sort
ardently
desiring
to
learn
they
were
of
all
ages
though
mostly
men
and
women
i
look
back
to
those
sundays
with
an
amount
of
pleasure
not
to
be
expressed
they
were
great
days
to
my
soul
the
work
of
instructing
my
dear
fellowslaves
was
the
sweetest
engagement
with
which
i
was
ever
blessed
we
loved
each
other
and
to
leave
them
at
the
close
of
the
sabbath
was
a
severe
cross
indeed
when
i
think
that
these
precious
souls
are
today
shut
up
in
the
prisonhouse
of
slavery
my
feelings
overcome
me
and
i
am
almost
ready
to
ask
does
a
righteous
god
govern
the
universe
and
for
what
does
he
hold
the
thunders
in
his
right
hand
if
not
to
smite
the
oppressor
and
deliver
the
spoiled
out
of
the
hand
of
the
spoiler
these
dear
souls
came
not
to
sabbath
school
because
it
was
popular
to
do
so
nor
did
i
teach
them
because
it
was
reputable
to
be
thus
engaged
every
moment
they
spent
in
that
school
they
were
liable
to
be
taken
up
and
given
thirtynine
lashes
they
came
because
they
wished
to
learn
their
minds
had
been
starved
by
their
cruel
masters
they
had
been
shut
up
in
mental
darkness
i
taught
them
because
it
was
the
delight
of
my
soul
to
be
doing
something
that
looked
like
bettering
the
condition
of
my
race
i
kept
up
my
school
nearly
the
whole
year
i
lived
with
mr
freeland
and
beside
my
sabbath
school
i
devoted
three
evenings
in
the
week
during
the
winter
to
teaching
the
slaves
at
home
and
i
have
the
happiness
to
know
that
several
of
those
who
came
to
sabbath
school
learned
how
to
read
and
that
one
at
least
is
now
free
through
my
agency
the
year
passed
off
smoothly
it
seemed
only
about
half
as
long
as
the
year
which
preceded
it
i
went
through
it
without
receiving
a
single
blow
i
will
give
mr
freeland
the
credit
of
being
the
best
master
i
ever
had
till
i
became
my
own
master
for
the
ease
with
which
i
passed
the
year
i
was
however
somewhat
indebted
to
the
society
of
my
fellowslaves
they
were
noble
souls

they
not
only
possessed
loving
hearts
but
brave
ones
we
were
linked
and
interlinked
with
each
other
i
loved
them
with
a
love
stronger
than
any
thing
i
have
experienced
since
it
is
sometimes
said
that
we
slaves
do
not
love
and
confide
in
each
other
in
answer
to
this
assertion
i
can
say
i
never
loved
any
or
confided
in
any
people
more
than
my
fellowslaves
and
especially
those
with
whom
i
lived
at
mr
freelands
i
believe
we
would
have
died
for
each
other
we
never
undertook
to
do
any
thing
of
any
importance
without
a
mutual
consultation
we
never
moved
separately
we
were
one
and
as
much
so
by
our
tempers
and
dispositions
as
by
the
mutual
hardships
to
which
we
were
necessarily
subjected
by
our
condition
as
slaves
at
the
close
of
the
year

mr
freeland
again
hired
me
of
my
master
for
the
year

but
by
this
time
i
began
to
want
to
live
upon
free
land
as
well
as
with
freeland
and
i
was
no
longer
content
therefore
to
live
with
him
or
any
other
slaveholder
i
began
with
the
commencement
of
the
year
to
prepare
myself
for
a
final
struggle
which
should
decide
my
fate
one
way
or
the
other
my
tendency
was
upward
i
was
fast
approaching
manhood
and
year
after
year
had
passed
and
i
was
still
a
slave
these
thoughts
roused
mei
must
do
something
i
therefore
resolved
that

should
not
pass
without
witnessing
an
attempt
on
my
part
to
secure
my
liberty
but
i
was
not
willing
to
cherish
this
determination
alone
my
fellowslaves
were
dear
to
me
i
was
anxious
to
have
them
participate
with
me
in
this
my
lifegiving
determination
i
therefore
though
with
great
prudence
commenced
early
to
ascertain
their
views
and
feelings
in
regard
to
their
condition
and
to
imbue
their
minds
with
thoughts
of
freedom
i
bent
myself
to
devising
ways
and
means
for
our
escape
and
meanwhile
strove
on
all
fitting
occasions
to
impress
them
with
the
gross
fraud
and
inhumanity
of
slavery
i
went
first
to
henry
next
to
john
then
to
the
others
i
found
in
them
all
warm
hearts
and
noble
spirits
they
were
ready
to
hear
and
ready
to
act
when
a
feasible
plan
should
be
proposed
this
was
what
i
wanted
i
talked
to
them
of
our
want
of
manhood
if
we
submitted
to
our
enslavement
without
at
least
one
noble
effort
to
be
free
we
met
often
and
consulted
frequently
and
told
our
hopes
and
fears
recounted
the
difficulties
real
and
imagined
which
we
should
be
called
on
to
meet
at
times
we
were
almost
disposed
to
give
up
and
try
to
content
ourselves
with
our
wretched
lot
at
others
we
were
firm
and
unbending
in
our
determination
to
go
whenever
we
suggested
any
plan
there
was
shrinkingthe
odds
were
fearful
our
path
was
beset
with
the
greatest
obstacles
and
if
we
succeeded
in
gaining
the
end
of
it
our
right
to
be
free
was
yet
questionablewe
were
yet
liable
to
be
returned
to
bondage
we
could
see
no
spot
this
side
of
the
ocean
where
we
could
be
free
we
knew
nothing
about
canada
our
knowledge
of
the
north
did
not
extend
farther
than
new
york
and
to
go
there
and
be
forever
harassed
with
the
frightful
liability
of
being
returned
to
slaverywith
the
certainty
of
being
treated
tenfold
worse
than
beforethe
thought
was
truly
a
horrible
one
and
one
which
it
was
not
easy
to
overcome
the
case
sometimes
stood
thus
at
every
gate
through
which
we
were
to
pass
we
saw
a
watchmanat
every
ferry
a
guardon
every
bridge
a
sentineland
in
every
wood
a
patrol
we
were
hemmed
in
upon
every
side
here
were
the
difficulties
real
or
imaginedthe
good
to
be
sought
and
the
evil
to
be
shunned
on
the
one
hand
there
stood
slavery
a
stern
reality
glaring
frightfully
upon
usits
robes
already
crimsoned
with
the
blood
of
millions
and

even
now
feasting
itself
greedily
upon
our
own
flesh
on
the
other
hand
away
back
in
the
dim
distance
under
the
flickering
light
of
the
north
star
behind
some
craggy
hill
or
snowcovered
mountain
stood
a
doubtful
freedomhalf
frozen
beckoning
us
to
come
and
share
its
hospitality
this
in
itself
was
sometimes
enough
to
stagger
us
but
when
we
permitted
ourselves
to
survey
the
road
we
were
frequently
appalled
upon
either
side
we
saw
grim
death
assuming
the
most
horrid
shapes
now
it
was
starvation
causing
us
to
eat
our
own
fleshnow
we
were
contending
with
the
waves
and
were
drownednow
we
were
overtaken
and
torn
to
pieces
by
the
fangs
of
the
terrible
bloodhound
we
were
stung
by
scorpions
chased
by
wild
beasts
bitten
by
snakes
and
finally
after
having
nearly
reached
the
desired
spotafter
swimming
rivers
encountering
wild
beasts
sleeping
in
the
woods
suffering
hunger
and
nakednesswe
were
overtaken
by
our
pursuers
and
in
our
resistance
we
were
shot
dead
upon
the
spot
i
say
this
picture
sometimes
appalled
us
and
made
us
rather
bear
those
ills
we
had
than
fly
to
others
that
we
knew
not
of
in
coming
to
a
fixed
determination
to
run
away
we
did
more
than
patrick
henry
when
he
resolved
upon
liberty
or
death
with
us
it
was
a
doubtful
liberty
at
most
and
almost
certain
death
if
we
failed
for
my
part
i
should
prefer
death
to
hopeless
bondage
sandy
one
of
our
number
gave
up
the
notion
but
still
encouraged
us
our
company
then
consisted
of
henry
harris
john
harris
henry
bailey
charles
roberts
and
myself
henry
bailey
was
my
uncle
and
belonged
to
my
master
charles
married
my
aunt
he
belonged
to
my
masters
fatherinlaw
mr
william
hamilton
the
plan
we
finally
concluded
upon
was
to
get
a
large
canoe
belonging
to
mr
hamilton
and
upon
the
saturday
night
previous
to
easter
holidays
paddle
directly
up
the
chesapeake
bay
on
our
arrival
at
the
head
of
the
bay
a
distance
of
seventy
or
eighty
miles
from
where
we
lived
it
was
our
purpose
to
turn
our
canoe
adrift
and
follow
the
guidance
of
the
north
star
till
we
got
beyond
the
limits
of
maryland
our
reason
for
taking
the
water
route
was
that
we
were
less
liable
to
be
suspected
as
runaways
we
hoped
to
be
regarded
as
fishermen
whereas
if
we
should
take
the
land
route
we
should
be
subjected
to
interruptions
of
almost
every
kind
any
one
having
a
white
face
and
being
so
disposed
could
stop
us
and
subject
us
to
examination
the
week
before
our
intended
start
i
wrote
several
protections
one
for
each
of
us
as
well
as
i
can
remember
they
were
in
the
following
words
to
wit
this
is
to
certify
that
i
the
undersigned
have
given
the
bearer
my
servant
full
liberty
to
go
to
baltimore
and
spend
the
easter
holidays
written
with
mine
own
hand
c

william
hamilton
near
st
michaels
in
talbot
county
maryland

we
were
not
going
to
baltimore
but
in
going
up
the
bay
we
went
toward
baltimore
and
these
protections
were
only
intended
to
protect
us
while
on
the
bay
as
the
time
drew
near
for
our
departure
our
anxiety
became
more
and
more
intense
it
was
truly
a
matter
of
life
and
death
with
us
the
strength
of
our
determination
was
about
to
be
fully
tested
at
this
time
i
was
very
active
in
explaining
every
difficulty
removing
every
doubt
dispelling
every
fear
and
inspiring
all
with
the
firmness
indispensable
to
success
in
our
undertaking
assuring
them
that
half
was
gained
the
instant
we
made
the
move
we
had
talked
long
enough
we
were
now
ready
to
move
if
not
now
we
never
should
be
and
if
we
did
not
intend
to
move
now
we
had
as
well
fold
our
arms
sit
down
and
acknowledge
ourselves
fit
only
to
be
slaves
this
none
of
us
were
prepared
to
acknowledge
every
man
stood
firm
and
at
our
last
meeting
we
pledged
ourselves
afresh
in
the
most
solemn
manner
that
at
the
time
appointed
we
would
certainly
start
in
pursuit
of
freedom
this
was
in
the
middle
of
the
week
at
the
end
of
which
we
were
to
be
off
we
went
as
usual
to
our
several
fields
of
labor
but
with
bosoms
highly
agitated
with
thoughts
of
our
truly
hazardous
undertaking
we
tried
to
conceal
our
feelings
as
much
as
possible
and
i
think
we
succeeded
very
well
after
a
painful
waiting
the
saturday
morning
whose
night
was
to
witness
our
departure
came
i
hailed
it
with
joy
bring
what
of
sadness
it
might
friday
night
was
a
sleepless
one
for
me
i
probably
felt
more
anxious
than
the
rest
because
i
was
by
common
consent
at
the
head
of
the
whole
affair
the
responsibility
of
success
or
failure
lay
heavily
upon
me
the
glory
of
the
one
and
the
confusion
of
the
other
were
alike
mine
the
first
two
hours
of
that
morning
were
such
as
i
never
experienced
before
and
hope
never
to
again
early
in
the
morning
we
went
as
usual
to
the
field
we
were
spreading
manure
and
all
at
once
while
thus
engaged
i
was
overwhelmed
with
an
indescribable
feeling
in
the
fulness
of
which
i
turned
to
sandy
who
was
near
by
and
said
we
are
betrayed
well
said
he
that
thought
has
this
moment
struck
me
we
said
no
more
i
was
never
more
certain
of
any
thing
the
horn
was
blown
as
usual
and
we
went
up
from
the
field
to
the
house
for
breakfast
i
went
for
the
form
more
than
for
want
of
any
thing
to
eat
that
morning
just
as
i
got
to
the
house
in
looking
out
at
the
lane
gate
i
saw
four
white
men
with
two
colored
men
the
white
men
were
on
horseback
and
the
colored
ones
were
walking
behind
as
if
tied
i
watched
them
a
few
moments
till
they
got
up
to
our
lane
gate
here
they
halted
and
tied
the
colored
men
to
the
gatepost
i
was
not
yet
certain
as
to
what
the
matter
was
in
a
few
moments
in
rode
mr
hamilton
with
a
speed
betokening
great
excitement
he
came
to
the
door
and
inquired
if
master
william
was
in
he
was
told
he
was
at
the
barn
mr
hamilton
without
dismounting
rode
up
to
the
barn
with
extraordinary
speed
in
a
few
moments
he
and
mr
freeland
returned
to
the
house
by
this
time
the
three
constables
rode
up
and
in
great
haste
dismounted
tied
their
horses
and
met
master
william
and
mr
hamilton
returning
from
the
barn
and
after
talking
awhile
they
all
walked
up
to
the
kitchen
door
there
was
no
one
in
the
kitchen
but
myself
and
john
henry
and
sandy
were
up
at
the
barn
mr
freeland
put
his
head
in
at
the
door
and
called
me
by
name
saying
there
were
some
gentlemen
at
the
door
who
wished
to
see
me
i
stepped
to
the
door
and
inquired
what
they

wanted
they
at
once
seized
me
and
without
giving
me
any
satisfaction
tied
melashing
my
hands
closely
together
i
insisted
upon
knowing
what
the
matter
was
they
at
length
said
that
they
had
learned
i
had
been
in
a
scrape
and
that
i
was
to
be
examined
before
my
master
and
if
their
information
proved
false
i
should
not
be
hurt
in
a
few
moments
they
succeeded
in
tying
john
they
then
turned
to
henry
who
had
by
this
time
returned
and
commanded
him
to
cross
his
hands
i
wont
said
henry
in
a
firm
tone
indicating
his
readiness
to
meet
the
consequences
of
his
refusal
wont
you
said
tom
graham
the
constable
no
i
wont
said
henry
in
a
still
stronger
tone
with
this
two
of
the
constables
pulled
out
their
shining
pistols
and
swore
by
their
creator
that
they
would
make
him
cross
his
hands
or
kill
him
each
cocked
his
pistol
and
with
fingers
on
the
trigger
walked
up
to
henry
saying
at
the
same
time
if
he
did
not
cross
his
hands
they
would
blow
his
damned
heart
out
shoot
me
shoot
me
said
henry
you
cant
kill
me
but
once
shoot
shootand
be
damned
i
wont
be
tied
this
he
said
in
a
tone
of
loud
defiance
and
at
the
same
time
with
a
motion
as
quick
as
lightning
he
with
one
single
stroke
dashed
the
pistols
from
the
hand
of
each
constable
as
he
did
this
all
hands
fell
upon
him
and
after
beating
him
some
time
they
finally
overpowered
him
and
got
him
tied
during
the
scuffle
i
managed
i
know
not
how
to
get
my
pass
out
and
without
being
discovered
put
it
into
the
fire
we
were
all
now
tied
and
just
as
we
were
to
leave
for
easton
jail
betsy
freeland
mother
of
william
freeland
came
to
the
door
with
her
hands
full
of
biscuits
and
divided
them
between
henry
and
john
she
then
delivered
herself
of
a
speech
to
the
following
effect
addressing
herself
to
me
she
said
you
devil
you
yellow
devil
it
was
you
that
put
it
into
the
heads
of
henry
and
john
to
run
away
but
for
you
you
long
legged
mulatto
devil
henry
nor
john
would
never
have
thought
of
such
a
thing
i
made
no
reply
and
was
immediately
hurried
off
towards
st
michaels
just
a
moment
previous
to
the
scuffle
with
henry
mr
hamilton
suggested
the
propriety
of
making
a
search
for
the
protections
which
he
had
understood
frederick
had
written
for
himself
and
the
rest
but
just
at
the
moment
he
was
about
carrying
his
proposal
into
effect
his
aid
was
needed
in
helping
to
tie
henry
and
the
excitement
attending
the
scuffle
caused
them
either
to
forget
or
to
deem
it
unsafe
under
the
circumstances
to
search
so
we
were
not
yet
convicted
of
the
intention
to
run
away
when
we
got
about
half
way
to
st
michaels
while
the
constables
having
us
in
charge
were
looking
ahead
henry
inquired
of
me
what
he
should
do
with
his
pass
i
told
him
to
eat
it
with
his
biscuit
and
own
nothing
and
we
passed
the
word
around
own
nothing
and
own
nothing
said
we
all
our
confidence
in
each
other
was
unshaken
we
were
resolved
to
succeed
or
fail
together
after
the
calamity
had
befallen
us
as
much
as
before
we
were
now
prepared
for
any
thing
we
were
to
be
dragged
that
morning
fifteen
miles
behind
horses
and
then
to
be
placed
in
the
easton
jail
when
we
reached
st
michaels
we
underwent
a
sort
of
examination
we
all
denied
that
we
ever
intended
to
run
away
we
did
this
more
to
bring
out
the
evidence
against
us
than
from
any
hope
of
getting
clear
of
being
sold
for
as
i
have
said
we
were
ready
for
that
the
fact
was
we
cared
but
little
where
we
went
so
we
went
together
our
greatest
concern
was
about
separation
we
dreaded
that
more
than
any
thing
this
side
of

death
we
found
the
evidence
against
us
to
be
the
testimony
of
one
person
our
master
would
not
tell
who
it
was
but
we
came
to
a
unanimous
decision
among
ourselves
as
to
who
their
informant
was
we
were
sent
off
to
the
jail
at
easton
when
we
got
there
we
were
delivered
up
to
the
sheriff
mr
joseph
graham
and
by
him
placed
in
jail
henry
john
and
myself
were
placed
in
one
room
togethercharles
and
henry
bailey
in
another
their
object
in
separating
us
was
to
hinder
concert
we
had
been
in
jail
scarcely
twenty
minutes
when
a
swarm
of
slave
traders
and
agents
for
slave
traders
flocked
into
jail
to
look
at
us
and
to
ascertain
if
we
were
for
sale
such
a
set
of
beings
i
never
saw
before
i
felt
myself
surrounded
by
so
many
fiends
from
perdition
a
band
of
pirates
never
looked
more
like
their
father
the
devil
they
laughed
and
grinned
over
us
saying
ah
my
boys
we
have
got
you
havent
we
and
after
taunting
us
in
various
ways
they
one
by
one
went
into
an
examination
of
us
with
intent
to
ascertain
our
value
they
would
impudently
ask
us
if
we
would
not
like
to
have
them
for
our
masters
we
would
make
them
no
answer
and
leave
them
to
find
out
as
best
they
could
then
they
would
curse
and
swear
at
us
telling
us
that
they
could
take
the
devil
out
of
us
in
a
very
little
while
if
we
were
only
in
their
hands
while
in
jail
we
found
ourselves
in
much
more
comfortable
quarters
than
we
expected
when
we
went
there
we
did
not
get
much
to
eat
nor
that
which
was
very
good
but
we
had
a
good
clean
room
from
the
windows
of
which
we
could
see
what
was
going
on
in
the
street
which
was
very
much
better
than
though
we
had
been
placed
in
one
of
the
dark
damp
cells
upon
the
whole
we
got
along
very
well
so
far
as
the
jail
and
its
keeper
were
concerned
immediately
after
the
holidays
were
over
contrary
to
all
our
expectations
mr
hamilton
and
mr
freeland
came
up
to
easton
and
took
charles
the
two
henrys
and
john
out
of
jail
and
carried
them
home
leaving
me
alone
i
regarded
this
separation
as
a
final
one
it
caused
me
more
pain
than
any
thing
else
in
the
whole
transaction
i
was
ready
for
any
thing
rather
than
separation
i
supposed
that
they
had
consulted
together
and
had
decided
that
as
i
was
the
whole
cause
of
the
intention
of
the
others
to
run
away
it
was
hard
to
make
the
innocent
suffer
with
the
guilty
and
that
they
had
therefore
concluded
to
take
the
others
home
and
sell
me
as
a
warning
to
the
others
that
remained
it
is
due
to
the
noble
henry
to
say
he
seemed
almost
as
reluctant
at
leaving
the
prison
as
at
leaving
home
to
come
to
the
prison
but
we
knew
we
should
in
all
probability
be
separated
if
we
were
sold
and
since
he
was
in
their
hands
he
concluded
to
go
peaceably
home
i
was
now
left
to
my
fate
i
was
all
alone
and
within
the
walls
of
a
stone
prison
but
a
few
days
before
and
i
was
full
of
hope
i
expected
to
have
been
safe
in
a
land
of
freedom
but
now
i
was
covered
with
gloom
sunk
down
to
the
utmost
despair
i
thought
the
possibility
of
freedom
was
gone
i
was
kept
in
this
way
about
one
week
at
the
end
of
which
captain
auld
my
master
to
my
surprise
and
utter
astonishment
came
up
and
took
me
out
with
the
intention
of
sending
me
with
a
gentleman
of
his
acquaintance
into
alabama
but
from
some
cause
or
other
he
did
not
send
me
to
alabama
but
concluded
to
send
me
back
to
baltimore
to
live
again
with
his
brother
hugh
and
to
learn
a
trade
thus
after
an
absence
of
three
years
and
one
month
i
was
once
more
permitted
to
return
to
my
old
home
at
baltimore
my
master
sent
me
away

because
there
existed
against
me
a
very
great
prejudice
in
the
community
and
he
feared
i
might
be
killed
in
a
few
weeks
after
i
went
to
baltimore
master
hugh
hired
me
to
mr
william
gardner
an
extensive
shipbuilder
on
fells
point
i
was
put
there
to
learn
how
to
calk
it
however
proved
a
very
unfavorable
place
for
the
accomplishment
of
this
object
mr
gardner
was
engaged
that
spring
in
building
two
large
manofwar
brigs
professedly
for
the
mexican
government
the
vessels
were
to
be
launched
in
the
july
of
that
year
and
in
failure
thereof
mr
gardner
was
to
lose
a
considerable
sum
so
that
when
i
entered
all
was
hurry
there
was
no
time
to
learn
any
thing
every
man
had
to
do
that
which
he
knew
how
to
do
in
entering
the
shipyard
my
orders
from
mr
gardner
were
to
do
whatever
the
carpenters
commanded
me
to
do
this
was
placing
me
at
the
beck
and
call
of
about
seventyfive
men
i
was
to
regard
all
these
as
masters
their
word
was
to
be
my
law
my
situation
was
a
most
trying
one
at
times
i
needed
a
dozen
pair
of
hands
i
was
called
a
dozen
ways
in
the
space
of
a
single
minute
three
or
four

if

ill
knock
your
brains
out
this
was
my
school
for
eight
months
and
i
might
have
remained
there
longer
but
for
a
most
horrid
fight
i
had
with
four
of
the
white
apprentices
in
which
my
left
eye
was
nearly
knocked
out
and
i
was
horribly
mangled
in
other
respects
the
facts
in
the
case
were
these
until
a
very
little
while
after
i
went
there
white
and
black
shipcarpenters
worked
side
by
side
and
no
one
seemed
to
see
any
impropriety
in
it
all
hands
seemed
to
be
very
well
satisfied
many
of
the
black
carpenters
were
freemen
things
seemed
to
be
going
on
very
well
all
at
once
the
white
carpenters
knocked
off
and
said
they
would
not
work
with
free
colored
workmen
their
reason
for
this
as
alleged
was
that
if
free
colored
carpenters
were
encouraged
they
would
soon
take
the
trade
into
their
own
hands
and
poor
white
men
would
be
thrown
out
of
employment
they
therefore
felt
called
upon
at
once
to
put
a
stop
to
it
and
taking
advantage
of
mr
gardners
necessities
they
broke
off
swearing
they
would
work
no
longer
unless
he
would
discharge
his
black
carpenters
now
though
this
did
not
extend
to
me
in
form
it
did
reach
me
in
fact
my
fellowapprentices
very
soon
began
to
feel
it
degrading
to
them
to
work
with
me
they
began
to
put
on
airs
and
talk
about
the
niggers
taking
the
country
saying
we
all
ought
to
be
killed
and
being
encouraged
by
the
journeymen
they
commenced
making
my
condition
as
hard
as
they
could
by
hectoring
me
around
and
sometimes
striking
me
i
of
course
kept
the
vow
i
made
after
the
fight
with
mr
covey
and
struck
back
again
regardless
of
consequences
and
while
i
kept
them
from
combining
i

succeeded
very
well
for
i
could
whip
the
whole
of
them
taking
them
separately
they
however
at
length
combined
and
came
upon
me
armed
with
sticks
stones
and
heavy
handspikes
one
came
in
front
with
a
half
brick
there
was
one
at
each
side
of
me
and
one
behind
me
while
i
was
attending
to
those
in
front
and
on
either
side
the
one
behind
ran
up
with
the
handspike
and
struck
me
a
heavy
blow
upon
the
head
it
stunned
me
i
fell
and
with
this
they
all
ran
upon
me
and
fell
to
beating
me
with
their
fists
i
let
them
lay
on
for
a
while
gathering
strength
in
an
instant
i
gave
a
sudden
surge
and
rose
to
my
hands
and
knees
just
as
i
did
that
one
of
their
number
gave
me
with
his
heavy
boot
a
powerful
kick
in
the
left
eye
my
eyeball
seemed
to
have
burst
when
they
saw
my
eye
closed
and
badly
swollen
they
left
me
with
this
i
seized
the
handspike
and
for
a
time
pursued
them
but
here
the
carpenters
interfered
and
i
thought
i
might
as
well
give
it
up
it
was
impossible
to
stand
my
hand
against
so
many
all
this
took
place
in
sight
of
not
less
than
fifty
white
shipcarpenters
and
not
one
interposed
a
friendly
word
but
some
cried
kill
the
damned
nigger
kill
him
kill
him
he
struck
a
white
person
i
found
my
only
chance
for
life
was
in
flight
i
succeeded
in
getting
away
without
an
additional
blow
and
barely
so
for
to
strike
a
white
man
is
death
by
lynch
lawand
that
was
the
law
in
mr
gardners
shipyard
nor
is
there
much
of
any
other
out
of
mr
gardners
shipyard
i
went
directly
home
and
told
the
story
of
my
wrongs
to
master
hugh
and
i
am
happy
to
say
of
him
irreligious
as
he
was
his
conduct
was
heavenly
compared
with
that
of
his
brother
thomas
under
similar
circumstances
he
listened
attentively
to
my
narration
of
the
circumstances
leading
to
the
savage
outrage
and
gave
many
proofs
of
his
strong
indignation
at
it
the
heart
of
my
once
overkind
mistress
was
again
melted
into
pity
my
puffedout
eye
and
bloodcovered
face
moved
her
to
tears
she
took
a
chair
by
me
washed
the
blood
from
my
face
and
with
a
mothers
tenderness
bound
up
my
head
covering
the
wounded
eye
with
a
lean
piece
of
fresh
beef
it
was
almost
compensation
for
my
suffering
to
witness
once
more
a
manifestation
of
kindness
from
this
my
once
affectionate
old
mistress
master
hugh
was
very
much
enraged
he
gave
expression
to
his
feelings
by
pouring
out
curses
upon
the
heads
of
those
who
did
the
deed
as
soon
as
i
got
a
little
the
better
of
my
bruises
he
took
me
with
him
to
esquire
watsons
on
bond
street
to
see
what
could
be
done
about
the
matter
mr
watson
inquired
who
saw
the
assault
committed
master
hugh
told
him
it
was
done
in
mr
gardners
shipyard
at
midday
where
there
were
a
large
company
of
men
at
work
as
to
that
he
said
the
deed
was
done
and
there
was
no
question
as
to
who
did
it
his
answer
was
he
could
do
nothing
in
the
case
unless
some
white
man
would
come
forward
and
testify
he
could
issue
no
warrant
on
my
word
if
i
had
been
killed
in
the
presence
of
a
thousand
colored
people
their
testimony
combined
would
have
been
insufficient
to
have
arrested
one
of
the
murderers
master
hugh
for
once
was
compelled
to
say
this
state
of
things
was
too
bad
of
course
it
was
impossible
to
get
any
white
man
to
volunteer
his
testimony
in
my
behalf
and
against
the
white
young
men
even
those
who
may
have
sympathized
with
me
were
not
prepared
to
do
this
it
required
a
degree
of
courage
unknown
to
them
to
do
so
for
just
at
that
time
the
slightest
manifestation
of
humanity
toward
a
colored
person
was
denounced
as
abolitionism
and
that
name
subjected
its
bearer
to
frightful
liabilities
the
watchwords
of
the
bloodyminded
in
that
region
and
in
those
days
were

damn
the
abolitionists
and
damn
the
niggers
there
was
nothing
done
and
probably
nothing
would
have
been
done
if
i
had
been
killed
such
was
and
such
remains
the
state
of
things
in
the
christian
city
of
baltimore
master
hugh
finding
he
could
get
no
redress
refused
to
let
me
go
back
again
to
mr
gardner
he
kept
me
himself
and
his
wife
dressed
my
wound
till
i
was
again
restored
to
health
he
then
took
me
into
the
shipyard
of
which
he
was
foreman
in
the
employment
of
mr
walter
price
there
i
was
immediately
set
to
calking
and
very
soon
learned
the
art
of
using
my
mallet
and
irons
in
the
course
of
one
year
from
the
time
i
left
mr
gardners
i
was
able
to
command
the
highest
wages
given
to
the
most
experienced
calkers
i
was
now
of
some
importance
to
my
master
i
was
bringing
him
from
six
to
seven
dollars
per
week
i
sometimes
brought
him
nine
dollars
per
week
my
wages
were
a
dollar
and
a
half
a
day
after
learning
how
to
calk
i
sought
my
own
employment
made
my
own
contracts
and
collected
the
money
which
i
earned
my
pathway
became
much
more
smooth
than
before
my
condition
was
now
much
more
comfortable
when
i
could
get
no
calking
to
do
i
did
nothing
during
these
leisure
times
those
old
notions
about
freedom
would
steal
over
me
again
when
in
mr
gardners
employment
i
was
kept
in
such
a
perpetual
whirl
of
excitement
i
could
think
of
nothing
scarcely
but
my
life
and
in
thinking
of
my
life
i
almost
forgot
my
liberty
i
have
observed
this
in
my
experience
of
slaverythat
whenever
my
condition
was
improved
instead
of
its
increasing
my
contentment
it
only
increased
my
desire
to
be
free
and
set
me
to
thinking
of
plans
to
gain
my
freedom
i
have
found
that
to
make
a
contented
slave
it
is
necessary
to
make
a
thoughtless
one
it
is
necessary
to
darken
his
moral
and
mental
vision
and
as
far
as
possible
to
annihilate
the
power
of
reason
he
must
be
able
to
detect
no
inconsistencies
in
slavery
he
must
be
made
to
feel
that
slavery
is
right
and
he
can
be
brought
to
that
only
when
he
ceases
to
be
a
man
i
was
now
getting
as
i
have
said
one
dollar
and
fifty
cents
per
day
i
contracted
for
it
i
earned
it
it
was
paid
to
me
it
was
rightfully
my
own
yet
upon
each
returning
saturday
night
i
was
compelled
to
deliver
every
cent
of
that
money
to
master
hugh
and
why
not
because
he
earned
itnot
because
he
had
any
hand
in
earning
itnot
because
i
owed
it
to
himnor
because
he
possessed
the
slightest
shadow
of
a
right
to
it
but
solely
because
he
had
the
power
to
compel
me
to
give
it
up
the
right
of
the
grimvisaged
pirate
upon
the
high
seas
is
exactly
the
same
chapter
xi
i
now
come
to
that
part
of
my
life
during
which
i
planned
and
finally
succeeded
in
making
my
escape
from
slavery
but
before
narrating
any
of
the
peculiar
circumstances
i
deem
it
proper
to
make
known
my
intention
not
to
state
all
the
facts
connected
with
the
transaction
my
reasons
for
pursuing
this
course
may
be
understood
from
the
following
first
were
i
to
give
a
minute
statement
of
all
the
facts
it
is
not
only
possible
but
quite
probable
that
others
would
thereby
be
involved
in
the
most
embarrassing
difficulties
secondly
such
a


statement
would
most
undoubtedly
induce
greater
vigilance
on
the
part
of
slaveholders
than
has
existed
heretofore
among
them
which
would
of
course
be
the
means
of
guarding
a
door
whereby
some
dear
brother
bondman
might
escape
his
galling
chains
i
deeply
regret
the
necessity
that
impels
me
to
suppress
any
thing
of
importance
connected
with
my
experience
in
slavery
it
would
afford
me
great
pleasure
indeed
as
well
as
materially
add
to
the
interest
of
my
narrative
were
i
at
liberty
to
gratify
a
curiosity
which
i
know
exists
in
the
minds
of
many
by
an
accurate
statement
of
all
the
facts
pertaining
to
my
most
fortunate
escape
but
i
must
deprive
myself
of
this
pleasure
and
the
curious
of
the
gratification
which
such
a
statement
would
afford
i
would
allow
myself
to
suffer
under
the
greatest
imputations
which
evilminded
men
might
suggest
rather
than
exculpate
myself
and
thereby
run
the
hazard
of
closing
the
slightest
avenue
by
which
a
brother
slave
might
clear
himself
of
the
chains
and
fetters
of
slavery
i
have
never
approved
of
the
very
public
manner
in
which
some
of
our
western
friends
have
conducted
what
they
call
the
underground
railroad
but
which
i
think
by
their
open
declarations
has
been
made
most
emphatically
the
upperground
railroad
i
honor
those
good
men
and
women
for
their
noble
daring
and
applaud
them
for
willingly
subjecting
themselves
to
bloody
persecution
by
openly
avowing
their
participation
in
the
escape
of
slaves
i
however
can
see
very
little
good
resulting
from
such
a
course
either
to
themselves
or
the
slaves
escaping
while
upon
the
other
hand
i
see
and
feel
assured
that
those
open
declarations
are
a
positive
evil
to
the
slaves
remaining
who
are
seeking
to
escape
they
do
nothing
towards
enlightening
the
slave
whilst
they
do
much
towards
enlightening
the
master
they
stimulate
him
to
greater
watchfulness
and
enhance
his
power
to
capture
his
slave
we
owe
something
to
the
slave
south
of
the
line
as
well
as
to
those
north
of
it
and
in
aiding
the
latter
on
their
way
to
freedom
we
should
be
careful
to
do
nothing
which
would
be
likely
to
hinder
the
former
from
escaping
from
slavery
i
would
keep
the
merciless
slaveholder
profoundly
ignorant
of
the
means
of
flight
adopted
by
the
slave
i
would
leave
him
to
imagine
himself
surrounded
by
myriads
of
invisible
tormentors
ever
ready
to
snatch
from
his
infernal
grasp
his
trembling
prey
let
him
be
left
to
feel
his
way
in
the
dark
let
darkness
commensurate
with
his
crime
hover
over
him
and
let
him
feel
that
at
every
step
he
takes
in
pursuit
of
the
flying
bondman
he
is
running
the
frightful
risk
of
having
his
hot
brains
dashed
out
by
an
invisible
agency
let
us
render
the
tyrant
no
aid
let
us
not
hold
the
light
by
which
he
can
trace
the
footprints
of
our
flying
brother
but
enough
of
this
i
will
now
proceed
to
the
statement
of
those
facts
connected
with
my
escape
for
which
i
am
alone
responsible
and
for
which
no
one
can
be
made
to
suffer
but
myself
in
the
early
part
of
the
year

i
became
quite
restless
i
could
see
no
reason
why
i
should
at
the
end
of
each
week
pour
the
reward
of
my
toil
into
the
purse
of
my
master
when
i
carried
to
him
my
weekly
wages
he
would
after
counting
the
money
look
me
in
the
face
with
a
robberlike
fierceness
and
ask
is
this
all
he
was
satisfied
with
nothing
less
than
the
last
cent
he
would
however
when
i
made
him
six
dollars
sometimes
give
me
six
cents
to
encourage
me
it
had
the
opposite
effect
i
regarded
it
as
a
sort
of
admission
of
my
right
to
the
whole
the
fact
that
he
gave
me
any
part
of
my
wages
was
proof
to
my
mind
that
he
believed
me
entitled
to
the
whole
of
them
i
always
felt

worse
for
having
received
any
thing
for
i
feared
that
the
giving
me
a
few
cents
would
ease
his
conscience
and
make
him
feel
himself
to
be
a
pretty
honorable
sort
of
robber
my
discontent
grew
upon
me
i
was
ever
on
the
lookout
for
means
of
escape
and
finding
no
direct
means
i
determined
to
try
to
hire
my
time
with
a
view
of
getting
money
with
which
to
make
my
escape
in
the
spring
of

when
master
thomas
came
to
baltimore
to
purchase
his
spring
goods
i
got
an
opportunity
and
applied
to
him
to
allow
me
to
hire
my
time
he
unhesitatingly
refused
my
request
and
told
me
this
was
another
stratagem
by
which
to
escape
he
told
me
i
could
go
nowhere
but
that
he
could
get
me
and
that
in
the
event
of
my
running
away
he
should
spare
no
pains
in
his
efforts
to
catch
me
he
exhorted
me
to
content
myself
and
be
obedient
he
told
me
if
i
would
be
happy
i
must
lay
out
no
plans
for
the
future
he
said
if
i
behaved
myself
properly
he
would
take
care
of
me
indeed
he
advised
me
to
complete
thoughtlessness
of
the
future
and
taught
me
to
depend
solely
upon
him
for
happiness
he
seemed
to
see
fully
the
pressing
necessity
of
setting
aside
my
intellectual
nature
in
order
to
contentment
in
slavery
but
in
spite
of
him
and
even
in
spite
of
myself
i
continued
to
think
and
to
think
about
the
injustice
of
my
enslavement
and
the
means
of
escape
about
two
months
after
this
i
applied
to
master
hugh
for
the
privilege
of
hiring
my
time
he
was
not
acquainted
with
the
fact
that
i
had
applied
to
master
thomas
and
had
been
refused
he
too
at
first
seemed
disposed
to
refuse
but
after
some
reflection
he
granted
me
the
privilege
and
proposed
the
following
terms
i
was
to
be
allowed
all
my
time
make
all
contracts
with
those
for
whom
i
worked
and
find
my
own
employment
and
in
return
for
this
liberty
i
was
to
pay
him
three
dollars
at
the
end
of
each
week
find
myself
in
calking
tools
and
in
board
and
clothing
my
board
was
two
dollars
and
a
half
per
week
this
with
the
wear
and
tear
of
clothing
and
calking
tools
made
my
regular
expenses
about
six
dollars
per
week
this
amount
i
was
compelled
to
make
up
or
relinquish
the
privilege
of
hiring
my
time
rain
or
shine
work
or
no
work
at
the
end
of
each
week
the
money
must
be
forthcoming
or
i
must
give
up
my
privilege
this
arrangement
it
will
be
perceived
was
decidedly
in
my
masters
favor
it
relieved
him
of
all
need
of
looking
after
me
his
money
was
sure
he
received
all
the
benefits
of
slaveholding
without
its
evils
while
i
endured
all
the
evils
of
a
slave
and
suffered
all
the
care
and
anxiety
of
a
freeman
i
found
it
a
hard
bargain
but
hard
as
it
was
i
thought
it
better
than
the
old
mode
of
getting
along
it
was
a
step
towards
freedom
to
be
allowed
to
bear
the
responsibilities
of
a
freeman
and
i
was
determined
to
hold
on
upon
it
i
bent
myself
to
the
work
of
making
money
i
was
ready
to
work
at
night
as
well
as
day
and
by
the
most
untiring
perseverance
and
industry
i
made
enough
to
meet
my
expenses
and
lay
up
a
little
money
every
week
i
went
on
thus
from
may
till
august
master
hugh
then
refused
to
allow
me
to
hire
my
time
longer
the
ground
for
his
refusal
was
a
failure
on
my
part
one
saturday
night
to
pay
him
for
my
weeks
time
this
failure
was
occasioned
by
my
attending
a
camp
meeting
about
ten
miles
from
baltimore
during
the
week
i
had
entered
into
an
engagement
with
a
number
of
young
friends
to
start
from
baltimore
to
the
camp
ground
early
saturday
evening
and
being
detained
by
my
employer
i
was
unable
to
get
down
to
master
hughs
without
disappointing
the
company
i
knew
that
master
hugh
was
in
no
special
need
of
the
money
that
night
i

therefore
decided
to
go
to
camp
meeting
and
upon
my
return
pay
him
the
three
dollars
i
staid
at
the
camp
meeting
one
day
longer
than
i
intended
when
i
left
but
as
soon
as
i
returned
i
called
upon
him
to
pay
him
what
he
considered
his
due
i
found
him
very
angry
he
could
scarce
restrain
his
wrath
he
said
he
had
a
great
mind
to
give
me
a
severe
whipping
he
wished
to
know
how
i
dared
go
out
of
the
city
without
asking
his
permission
i
told
him
i
hired
my
time
and
while
i
paid
him
the
price
which
he
asked
for
it
i
did
not
know
that
i
was
bound
to
ask
him
when
and
where
i
should
go
this
reply
troubled
him
and
after
reflecting
a
few
moments
he
turned
to
me
and
said
i
should
hire
my
time
no
longer
that
the
next
thing
he
should
know
of
i
would
be
running
away
upon
the
same
plea
he
told
me
to
bring
my
tools
and
clothing
home
forthwith
i
did
so
but
instead
of
seeking
work
as
i
had
been
accustomed
to
do
previously
to
hiring
my
time
i
spent
the
whole
week
without
the
performance
of
a
single
stroke
of
work
i
did
this
in
retaliation
saturday
night
he
called
upon
me
as
usual
for
my
weeks
wages
i
told
him
i
had
no
wages
i
had
done
no
work
that
week
here
we
were
upon
the
point
of
coming
to
blows
he
raved
and
swore
his
determination
to
get
hold
of
me
i
did
not
allow
myself
a
single
word
but
was
resolved
if
he
laid
the
weight
of
his
hand
upon
me
it
should
be
blow
for
blow
he
did
not
strike
me
but
told
me
that
he
would
find
me
in
constant
employment
in
future
i
thought
the
matter
over
during
the
next
day
sunday
and
finally
resolved
upon
the
third
day
of
september
as
the
day
upon
which
i
would
make
a
second
attempt
to
secure
my
freedom
i
now
had
three
weeks
during
which
to
prepare
for
my
journey
early
on
monday
morning
before
master
hugh
had
time
to
make
any
engagement
for
me
i
went
out
and
got
employment
of
mr
butler
at
his
shipyard
near
the
drawbridge
upon
what
is
called
the
city
block
thus
making
it
unnecessary
for
him
to
seek
employment
for
me
at
the
end
of
the
week
i
brought
him
between
eight
and
nine
dollars
he
seemed
very
well
pleased
and
asked
why
i
did
not
do
the
same
the
week
before
he
little
knew
what
my
plans
were
my
object
in
working
steadily
was
to
remove
any
suspicion
he
might
entertain
of
my
intent
to
run
away
and
in
this
i
succeeded
admirably
i
suppose
he
thought
i
was
never
better
satisfied
with
my
condition
than
at
the
very
time
during
which
i
was
planning
my
escape
the
second
week
passed
and
again
i
carried
him
my
full
wages
and
so
well
pleased
was
he
that
he
gave
me
twentyfive
cents
quite
a
large
sum
for
a
slaveholder
to
give
a
slave
and
bade
me
to
make
a
good
use
of
it
i
told
him
i
would
things
went
on
without
very
smoothly
indeed
but
within
there
was
trouble
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
describe
my
feelings
as
the
time
of
my
contemplated
start
drew
near
i
had
a
number
of
warmhearted
friends
in
baltimorefriends
that
i
loved
almost
as
i
did
my
lifeand
the
thought
of
being
separated
from
them
forever
was
painful
beyond
expression
it
is
my
opinion
that
thousands
would
escape
from
slavery
who
now
remain
but
for
the
strong
cords
of
affection
that
bind
them
to
their
friends
the
thought
of
leaving
my
friends
was
decidedly
the
most
painful
thought
with
which
i
had
to
contend
the
love
of
them
was
my
tender
point
and
shook
my
decision
more
than
all
things
else
besides
the
pain
of
separation
the
dread
and
apprehension
of
a
failure
exceeded
what
i
had
experienced
at
my
first
attempt
the
appalling
defeat
i
then
sustained
returned
to
torment
me
i
felt
assured
that
if
i
failed
in
this
attempt
my
case
would
be
a
hopeless
oneit
would
seal
my
fate
as
a
slave
forever
i

could
not
hope
to
get
off
with
any
thing
less
than
the
severest
punishment
and
being
placed
beyond
the
means
of
escape
it
required
no
very
vivid
imagination
to
depict
the
most
frightful
scenes
through
which
i
should
have
to
pass
in
case
i
failed
the
wretchedness
of
slavery
and
the
blessedness
of
freedom
were
perpetually
before
me
it
was
life
and
death
with
me
but
i
remained
firm
and
according
to
my
resolution
on
the
third
day
of
september

i
left
my
chains
and
succeeded
in
reaching
new
york
without
the
slightest
interruption
of
any
kind
how
i
did
sowhat
means
i
adoptedwhat
direction
i
travelled
and
by
what
mode
of
conveyancei
must
leave
unexplained
for
the
reasons
before
mentioned
i
have
been
frequently
asked
how
i
felt
when
i
found
myself
in
a
free
state
i
have
never
been
able
to
answer
the
question
with
any
satisfaction
to
myself
it
was
a
moment
of
the
highest
excitement
i
ever
experienced
i
suppose
i
felt
as
one
may
imagine
the
unarmed
mariner
to
feel
when
he
is
rescued
by
a
friendly
manofwar
from
the
pursuit
of
a
pirate
in
writing
to
a
dear
friend
immediately
after
my
arrival
at
new
york
i
said
i
felt
like
one
who
had
escaped
a
den
of
hungry
lions
this
state
of
mind
however
very
soon
subsided
and
i
was
again
seized
with
a
feeling
of
great
insecurity
and
loneliness
i
was
yet
liable
to
be
taken
back
and
subjected
to
all
the
tortures
of
slavery
this
in
itself
was
enough
to
damp
the
ardor
of
my
enthusiasm
but
the
loneliness
overcame
me
there
i
was
in
the
midst
of
thousands
and
yet
a
perfect
stranger
without
home
and
without
friends
in
the
midst
of
thousands
of
my
own
brethrenchildren
of
a
common
father
and
yet
i
dared
not
to
unfold
to
any
one
of
them
my
sad
condition
i
was
afraid
to
speak
to
any
one
for
fear
of
speaking
to
the
wrong
one
and
thereby
falling
into
the
hands
of
moneyloving
kidnappers
whose
business
it
was
to
lie
in
wait
for
the
panting
fugitive
as
the
ferocious
beasts
of
the
forest
lie
in
wait
for
their
prey
the
motto
which
i
adopted
when
i
started
from
slavery
was
thistrust
no
man
i
saw
in
every
white
man
an
enemy
and
in
almost
every
colored
man
cause
for
distrust
it
was
a
most
painful
situation
and
to
understand
it
one
must
needs
experience
it
or
imagine
himself
in
similar
circumstances
let
him
be
a
fugitive
slave
in
a
strange
landa
land
given
up
to
be
the
huntingground
for
slaveholderswhose
inhabitants
are
legalized
kidnapperswhere
he
is
every
moment
subjected
to
the
terrible
liability
of
being
seized
upon
by
his
fellowmen
as
the
hideous
crocodile
seizes
upon
his
preyi
say
let
him
place
himself
in
my
situationwithout

money
or
creditwanting
shelter
and
no
one
to
give
itwanting
bread
and
no
money
to
buy

at
the
same
time
let
him
feel
that
he
is
pursued
by
merciless
menhunters
and
in
total
darkness
as
to
what
to
do
where
to
go
or
where
to
stayperfectly
helpless
both
as
to
the
means
of
defence
and

of
plenty

suffering
the
terrible
gnawings
of
hungerin
the
midst
of
houses
yet
having
no

fellowmen
yet
feeling
as
if
in
the
midst
of
wild
beasts
whose
greediness
to
swallow
up
the
trembling
and
half
famished
fugitive
is
only
equalled
by
that
with
which
the
monsters
of
the
deep
swallow
up
the
helpless
fish
upon
which
they
subsisti

most
trying
situationthe
situation
in
which
i
was
placedthen
and
not

then
will
he
fully
appreciate
the
hardships
of
and
know
how
to
sympathize
with
the
toilworn
and
whipscarred
fugitive
slave

thank
heaven
i
remained
but
a
short
time
in
this
distressed
situation
i
was
relieved
from
it
by
the
humane
hand
of
mr
david
ruggles
whose
vigilance
kindness
and
perseverance
i
shall
never
forget
i
am
glad
of
an
opportunity
to
express
as
far
as
words
can
the
love
and
gratitude
i
bear
him
mr
ruggles
is
now
afflicted
with
blindness
and
is
himself
in
need
of
the
same
kind
offices
which
he
was
once
so
forward
in
the
performance
of
toward
others
i
had
been
in
new
york
but
a
few
days
when
mr
ruggles
sought
me
out
and
very
kindly
took
me
to
his
boardinghouse
at
the
corner
of
church
and
lespenard
streets
mr
ruggles
was
then
very
deeply
engaged
in
the
memorable
darg
case
as
well
as
attending
to
a
number
of
other
fugitive
slaves
devising
ways
and
means
for
their
successful
escape
and
though
watched
and
hemmed
in
on
almost
every
side
he
seemed
to
be
more
than
a
match
for
his
enemies
very
soon
after
i
went
to
mr
ruggles
he
wished
to
know
of
me
where
i
wanted
to
go
as
he
deemed
it
unsafe
for
me
to
remain
in
new
york
i
told
him
i
was
a
calker
and
should
like
to
go
where
i
could
get
work
i
thought
of
going
to
canada
but
he
decided
against
it
and
in
favor
of
my
going
to
new
bedford
thinking
i
should
be
able
to
get
work
there
at
my
trade
at
this
time
anna

intended
wife
came
on
for

wrote
to
her
immediately
after
my
arrival
at
new
york
notwithstanding
my
homeless
houseless
and
helpless
condition
informing
her
of
my
successful
flight
and
wishing
her
to
come
on
forthwith
in
a
few
days
after
her
arrival

passage
on
board
of
the
steamboat
john
w
richmond
for
newport
on
our
way
to
new
bedford
mr
ruggles
gave
me
a
letter
to
a
mr
shaw
in
newport
and
told
me
in
case
my
money
did
not
serve
me
to
new
bedford
to
stop
in
newport
and
obtain
further
assistance
but
upon
our
arrival
at
newport
we
were
so
anxious
to
get
to
a
place
of
safety
that
notwithstanding
she
was
free
i
had
changed
my
name
from
frederick
bailey
to
that
of
johnson

we
lacked
the
necessary
money
to
pay
our
fare
we
decided
to
take
seats
in
the
stage
and
promise
to
pay
when
we
got
to
new
bedford
we
were
encouraged
to
do
this
by
two
excellent
gentlemen
residents
of
new
bedford
whose
names
i
afterward
ascertained
to
be
joseph
ricketson
and
william
c
taber
they
seemed
at
once
to
understand
our
circumstances
and
gave
us
such
assurance
of
their
friendliness
as
put
us
fully
at
ease
in
their
presence
it
was
good
indeed
to
meet
with
such
friends
at
such
a
time
upon
reaching
new
bedford
we
were
directed
to
the
house
of
mr
nathan
johnson
by
whom
we
were
kindly
received
and
hospitably
provided
for
both
mr
and
mrs
johnson
took
a
deep
and
lively
interest
in
our
welfare
they
proved
themselves
quite
worthy
of
the
name
of
abolitionists
when
the
stagedriver
found
us
unable
to
pay
our
fare
he
held
on
upon
our
baggage
as
security
for
the
debt
i
had
but
to
mention
the
fact
to
mr
johnson
and
he
forthwith
advanced
the
money
we
now
began
to
feel
a
degree
of
safety
and
to
prepare
ourselves
for
the
duties
and
responsibilities
of
a
life
of
freedom
on
the
morning
after
our
arrival
at
new
bedford
while
at
the
breakfasttable
the
question
arose
as
to
what
name
i
should
be
called
by
the
name
given
me
by
my
mother
was
frederick
augustus
washington
bailey
i
however
had
dispensed
with
the
two
middle
names
long
before
i
left
maryland
so
that
i
was
generally
known
by
the
name
of
frederick
bailey
i
started
from
baltimore
bearing
the
name
of
stanley
when
i
got
to
new
york
i
again
changed
my
name
to
frederick
johnson
and
thought
that
would
be
the
last
change
but
when
i
got
to
new
bedford
i
found
it
necessary
again
to
change
my
name
the
reason
of
this
necessity
was
that
there
were
so
many
johnsons
in
new
bedford
it
was
already
quite
difficult
to
distinguish
between
them
i
gave
mr
johnson
the
privilege
of
choosing
me
a
name
but
told
him
he
must
not
take
from
me
the
name
of
frederick
i
must
hold
on
to
that
to
preserve
a
sense
of
my
identity
mr
johnson
had
just
been
reading
the
lady
of
the
lake
and
at
once
suggested
that
my
name
be
douglass
from
that
time
until
now
i
have
been
called
frederick
douglass
and
as
i
am
more
widely
known
by
that
name
than
by
either
of
the
others
i
shall
continue
to
use
it
as
my
own
i
was
quite
disappointed
at
the
general
appearance
of
things
in
new
bedford
the
impression
which
i
had
received
respecting
the
character
and
condition
of
the
people
of
the
north
i
found
to
be
singularly
erroneous
i
had
very
strangely
supposed
while
in
slavery
that
few
of
the
comforts
and
scarcely
any
of
the
luxuries
of
life
were
enjoyed
at
the
north
compared
with
what
were
enjoyed
by
the
slaveholders
of
the
south
i
probably
came
to
this
conclusion
from
the
fact
that
northern
people
owned
no
slaves
i
supposed
that
they
were
about
upon
a
level
with
the
nonslaveholding
population
of
the
south
i
knew
they
were
exceedingly
poor
and
i
had
been
accustomed
to
regard
their
poverty
as
the
necessary
consequence
of
their
being
nonslaveholders
i
had
somehow
imbibed
the
opinion
that
in
the
absence
of
slaves
there
could
be
no
wealth
and
very
little
refinement
and
upon
coming
to
the
north
i
expected
to
meet
with
a
rough
hardhanded
and
uncultivated
population
living
in
the
most
spartanlike
simplicity
knowing
nothing
of
the
ease
luxury
pomp
and
grandeur
of
southern
slaveholders
such
being
my
conjectures
any
one
acquainted
with
the
appearance
of
new
bedford
may
very
readily
infer
how
palpably
i
must
have
seen
my
mistake

in
the
afternoon
of
the
day
when
i
reached
new
bedford
i
visited
the
wharves
to
take
a
view
of
the
shipping
here
i
found
myself
surrounded
with
the
strongest
proofs
of
wealth
lying
at
the
wharves
and
riding
in
the
stream
i
saw
many
ships
of
the
finest
model
in
the
best
order
and
of
the
largest
size
upon
the
right
and
left
i
was
walled
in
by
granite
warehouses
of
the
widest
dimensions
stowed
to
their
utmost
capacity
with
the
necessaries
and
comforts
of
life
added
to
this
almost
every
body
seemed
to
be
at
work
but
noiselessly
so
compared
with
what
i
had
been
accustomed
to
in
baltimore
there
were
no
loud
songs
heard
from
those
engaged
in
loading
and
unloading
ships
i
heard
no
deep
oaths
or
horrid
curses
on
the
laborer
i
saw
no
whipping
of
men
but
all
seemed
to
go
smoothly
on
every
man
appeared
to
understand
his
work
and
went
at
it
with
a
sober
yet
cheerful
earnestness
which
betokened
the
deep
interest
which
he
felt
in
what
he
was
doing
as
well
as
a
sense
of
his
own
dignity
as
a
man
to
me
this
looked
exceedingly
strange
from
the
wharves
i
strolled
around
and
over
the
town
gazing
with
wonder
and
admiration
at
the
splendid
churches
beautiful
dwellings
and
finelycultivated
gardens
evincing
an
amount
of
wealth
comfort
taste
and
refinement
such
as
i
had
never
seen
in
any
part
of
slaveholding
maryland
every
thing
looked
clean
new
and
beautiful
i
saw
few
or
no
dilapidated
houses
with
povertystricken
inmates
no
halfnaked
children
and
barefooted
women
such
as
i
had
been
accustomed
to
see
in
hillsborough
easton
st
michaels
and
baltimore
the
people
looked
more
able
stronger
healthier
and
happier
than
those
of
maryland
i
was
for
once
made
glad
by
a
view
of
extreme
wealth
without
being
saddened
by
seeing
extreme
poverty
but
the
most
astonishing
as
well
as
the
most
interesting
thing
to
me
was
the
condition
of
the
colored
people
a
great
many
of
whom
like
myself
had
escaped
thither
as
a
refuge
from
the
hunters
of
men
i
found
many
who
had
not
been
seven
years
out
of
their
chains
living
in
finer
houses
and
evidently
enjoying
more
of
the
comforts
of
life
than
the
average
of
slaveholders
in
maryland
i
will
venture
to
assert
that
my
friend
mr
nathan
johnson
of
whom
i
can
say
with
a
grateful
heart
i
was
hungry
and
he
gave
me
meat
i
was
thirsty
and
he
gave
me
drink
i
was
a
stranger
and
he
took
me
in
lived
in
a
neater
house
dined
at
a
better
table
took
paid
for
and
read
more
newspapers
better
understood
the
moral
religious
and
political
character
of
the
nationthan
nine
tenths
of
the
slaveholders
in
talbot
county
maryland
yet
mr
johnson
was
a
working
man
his
hands
were
hardened
by
toil
and
not
his
alone
but
those
also
of
mrs
johnson
i
found
the
colored
people
much
more
spirited
than
i
had
supposed
they
would
be
i
found
among
them
a
determination
to
protect
each
other
from
the
bloodthirsty
kidnapper
at
all
hazards
soon
after
my
arrival
i
was
told
of
a
circumstance
which
illustrated
their
spirit
a
colored
man
and
a
fugitive
slave
were
on
unfriendly
terms
the
former
was
heard
to
threaten
the
latter
with
informing
his
master
of
his
whereabouts
straightway
a
meeting
was
called
among
the
colored
people
under
the
stereotyped
notice
business
of
importance
the
betrayer
was
invited
to
attend
the
people
came
at
the
appointed
hour
and
organized
the
meeting
by
appointing
a
very
religious
old
gentleman
as
president
who
i
believe
made
a
prayer
after
which
he
addressed
the
meeting
as
follows
friends
we
have
got
him
here
and
i
would
recommend
that
you
young
men
just
take
him
outside
the
door
and
kill
him
with
this
a

number
of
them
bolted
at
him
but
they
were
intercepted
by
some
more
timid
than
themselves
and
the
betrayer
escaped
their
vengeance
and
has
not
been
seen
in
new
bedford
since
i
believe
there
have
been
no
more
such
threats
and
should
there
be
hereafter
i
doubt
not
that
death
would
be
the
consequence
i
found
employment
the
third
day
after
my
arrival
in
stowing
a
sloop
with
a
load
of
oil
it
was
new
dirty
and
hard
work
for
me
but
i
went
at
it
with
a
glad
heart
and
a
willing
hand
i
was
now
my
own
master
it
was
a
happy
moment
the
rapture
of
which
can
be
understood
only
by
those
who
have
been
slaves
it
was
the
first
work
the
reward
of
which
was
to
be
entirely
my
own
there
was
no
master
hugh
standing
ready
the
moment
i
earned
the
money
to
rob
me
of
it
i
worked
that
day
with
a
pleasure
i
had
never
before
experienced
i
was
at
work
for
myself
and
newlymarried
wife
it
was
to
me
the
startingpoint
of
a
new
existence
when
i
got
through
with
that
job
i
went
in
pursuit
of
a
job
of
calking
but
such
was
the
strength
of
prejudice
against
color
among
the
white
calkers
that
they
refused
to
work
with
me
and
of
course
i
could
get
no
employment
finding
my
trade
of
no
immediate
benefit
i
threw
off
my
calking
habiliments
and
prepared
myself
to
do
any
kind
of
work
i
could
get
to
do
mr
johnson
kindly
let
me
have
his
woodhorse
and
saw
and
i
very
soon
found
myself
a
plenty
of
work
there
was
no
work
too
hardnone
too
dirty
i
was
ready
to
saw
wood
shovel
coal
carry
wood
sweep
the
chimney
or
roll
oil
casksall
of
which
i
did
in
about
four
months
after
i
went
to
new
bedford
there
came
a
young
man
to
me
and
inquired
if
i
did
not
wish
to
take
the
liberator
i
told
him
i
did
but
just
having
made
my
escape
from
slavery
i
remarked
that
i
was
unable
to
pay
for
it
then
i
however
finally
became
a
subscriber
to
it
the
paper
came
and
i
read
it
from
week
to
week
with
such
feelings
as
it
would
be
quite
idle
for
me
to
attempt
to
describe
the
paper
became
my
meat
and
my
drink
my
soul
was
set
all
on
fire
its
sympathy
for
my
brethren
in
bondsits
scathing
denunciations
of
slaveholdersits
faithful
exposures
of
slaveryand
its
powerful
attacks
upon
the
upholders
of
the
institutionsent
a
thrill
of
joy
through
my
soul
such
as
i
had
never
felt
before
i
had
not
long
been
a
reader
of
the
liberator
before
i
got
a
pretty
correct
idea
of
the
principles
measures
and
spirit
of
the
antislavery
reform
i
took
right
hold
of
the
cause
i
could
do
but
little
but
what
i
could
i
did
with
a
joyful
heart
and
never
felt
happier
than
when
in
an
antislavery
meeting
i
seldom
had
much
to
say
at
the
meetings
because
what
i
wanted
to
say
was
said
so
much
better
by
others
but
while
attending
an
antislavery
convention
at
nantucket
on
the
th
of
august

i
felt
strongly
moved
to
speak
and
was
at
the
same
time
much
urged
to
do
so
by
mr
william
c
coffin
a
gentleman
who
had
heard
me
speak
in
the
colored
peoples
meeting
at
new
bedford
it
was

i
am
told
that
colored
persons
can
now
get
employment
at
calking
in
new
bedforda
result
of
anti
slavery
effort
this
work
i
did
for
nearly
three
years
in
new
bedford
before
i
became
known
to
the
antislavery
world

a
severe
cross
and
i
took
it
up
reluctantly
the
truth
was
i
felt
myself
a
slave
and
the
idea
of
speaking
to
white
people
weighed
me
down
i
spoke
but
a
few
moments
when
i
felt
a
degree
of
freedom
and
said
what
i
desired
with
considerable
ease
from
that
time
until
now
i
have
been
engaged
in
pleading
the
cause
of
my
brethrenwith
what
success
and
with
what
devotion
i
leave
those
acquainted
with
my
labors
to
decide
appendix
i
find
since
reading
over
the
foregoing
narrative
that
i
have
in
several
instances
spoken
in
such
a
tone
and
manner
respecting
religion
as
may
possibly
lead
those
unacquainted
with
my
religious
views
to
suppose
me
an
opponent
of
all
religion
to
remove
the
liability
of
such
misapprehension
i
deem
it
proper
to
append
the
following
brief
explanation
what
i
have
said
respecting
and
against
religion
i
mean
strictly
to
apply
to
the
slaveholding
religion
of
this
land
and
with
no
possible
reference
to
christianity
proper
for
between
the
christianity
of
this
land
and
the
christianity
of
christ
i
recognize
the
widest
possible
differenceso
wide
that
to
receive
the
one
as
good
pure
and
holy
is
of
necessity
to
reject
the
other
as
bad
corrupt
and
wicked
to
be
the
friend
of
the
one
is
of
necessity
to
be
the
enemy
of
the
other
i
love
the
pure
peaceable
and
impartial
christianity
of
christ
i
therefore
hate
the
corrupt
slaveholding
womenwhipping
cradleplundering
partial
and
hypocritical
christianity
of
this
land
indeed
i
can
see
no
reason
but
the
most
deceitful
one
for
calling
the
religion
of
this
land
christianity
i
look
upon
it
as
the
climax
of
all
misnomers
the
boldest
of
all
frauds
and
the
grossest
of
all
libels
never
was
there
a
clearer
case
of
stealing
the
livery
of
the
court
of
heaven
to
serve
the
devil
in
i
am
filled
with
unutterable
loathing
when
i
contemplate
the
religious
pomp
and
show
together
with
the
horrible
inconsistencies
which
every
where
surround
me
we
have
menstealers
for
ministers
womenwhippers
for
missionaries
and
cradle
plunderers
for

members
the
man
who
wields
the
bloodclotted
cowskin
during
the
week
fills
the
pulpit
on

and
claims
to
be
a
minister
of
the
meek
and
lowly
jesus
the
man
who
robs
me
of
my
earnings
at
the
end
of
each
week
meets
me
as
a
classleader
on
sunday
morning
to
show
me
the
way
of
life
and
the
path
of
salvation
he
who
sells
my
sister
for
purposes
of
prostitution
stands
forth
as
the
pious
advocate
of
purity
he
who
proclaims
it
a
religious
duty
to
read
the
bible
denies
me
the
right
of
learning
to
read
the
name
of
the
god
who
made
me
he
who
is
the
religious
advocate
of
marriage
robs
whole
millions
of
its
sacred
influence
and
leaves
them
to
the
ravages
of
wholesale
pollution
the

have
religion
and
robbery
the
allies
of
each
otherdevils
dressed
in
angels
robes
and
hell
presenting
the
semblance
of
paradise
just
god
and
these
are
they
who
minister
at
thine
altar
god
of
right
men
who
their
hands
with
prayer
and
blessing
lay
on
israels
ark
of
light
what
preach
and
kidnap
men
give
thanks
and
rob
thy
own
afflicted
poor
talk
of
thy
glorious
liberty
and
then
bolt
hard
the
captives
door
what
servants
of
thy
own
merciful
son
who
came
to
seek
and
save
the
homeless
and
the
outcast
fettering
down
the
tasked
and
plundered
slave
pilate
and
herod
friends
chief
priests
and
rulers
as
of
old
combine
just
god
and
holy
is
that
church
which
lends
strength
to
the
spoiler
thine
the
christianity
of
america
is
a
christianity
of
whose
votaries
it
may
be
as
truly
said
as
it
was
of
the
ancient
scribes
and
pharisees
they
bind
heavy
burdens
and
grievous
to
be
borne
and
lay
them
on
mens
shoulders
but
they
themselves
will
not
move
them
with
one
of
their
fingers
all
their
works
they
do
for
to
be
seen
of
menthey
love
the
uppermost
rooms
at
feasts
and
the
chief
seats
in
the
synagogues






and
to
be
called
of
men
rabbi
rabbibut
woe
unto
you
scribes
and
pharisees
hypocrites
for
ye
shut
up
the
kingdom
of
heaven
against
men
for
ye
neither
go
in
yourselves
neither
suffer
ye
them
that
are
entering
to
go
in
ye
devour
widows
houses
and
for
a
pretence
make
long
prayers
therefore
ye
shall
receive
the
greater
damnation
ye
compass
sea
and
land
to
make
one
proselyte
and
when
he
is
made
ye
make
him
twofold
more
the
child
of
hell
than
yourselveswoe
unto
you
scribes
and
pharisees
hypocrites
for
ye
pay
tithe
of
mint
and
anise
and
cumin
and
have
omitted
the
weightier
matters
of
the
law
judgment
mercy
and
faith
these
ought
ye
to
have
done
and
not
to
leave
the
other
undone
ye
blind
guides
which
strain
at
a
gnat
and
swallow
a
camel
woe
unto
you
scribes
and
pharisees
hypocrites
for
ye
make
clean
the
outside
of
the
cup
and
of
the
platter
but
within
they
are
full
of
extortion
and
excesswoe
unto
you
scribes
and
pharisees
hypocrites
for
ye
are
like
unto
whited
sepulchres
which
indeed
appear
beautiful
outward
but
are
within
full
of
dead
mens
bones
and
of
all
uncleanness
even
so
ye
also
outwardly
appear
righteous
unto
men
but
within
ye
are
full
of
hypocrisy
and
iniquity
dark
and
terrible
as
is
this
picture
i
hold
it
to
be
strictly
true
of
the
overwhelming
mass
of
professed
christians
in
america
they
strain
at
a
gnat
and
swallow
a
camel
could
any
thing
be
more
true
of
our
churches
they
would
be
shocked
at
the
proposition
of
fellowshipping
a
sheepstealer
and
at
the
same
time
they
hug
to
their
communion
a
manstealer
and
brand
me
with
being
an
infidel
if
i
find
fault
with
them
for
it
they
attend
with
pharisaical
strictness
to
the
outward
forms
of
religion
and
at
the
same
time
neglect
the
weightier
matters
of
the
law
judgment
mercy
and
faith
they
are
always
ready

to
sacrifice
but
seldom
to
show
mercy
they
are
they
who
are
represented
as
professing
to
love
god
whom
they
have
not
seen
whilst
they
hate
their
brother
whom
they
have
seen
they
love
the
heathen
on
the
other
side
of
the
globe
they
can
pray
for
him
pay
money
to
have
the
bible
put
into
his
hand
and
missionaries
to
instruct
him
while
they
despise
and
totally
neglect
the
heathen
at
their
own
doors
such
is
very
briefly
my
view
of
the
religion
of
this
land
and
to
avoid
any
misunderstanding
growing
out
of
the
use
of
general
terms
i
mean
by
the
religion
of
this
land
that
which
is
revealed
in
the
words
deeds
and
actions
of
those
bodies
north
and
south
calling
themselves
christian
churches
and
yet
in
union
with
slaveholders
it
is
against
religion
as
presented
by
these
bodies
that
i
have
felt
it
my
duty
to
testify
i
conclude
these
remarks
by
copying
the
following
portrait
of
the
religion
of
the
south
which
is
by
communion
and
fellowship
the
religion
of
the
north
which
i
soberly
affirm
is
true
to
the
life
and
without
caricature
or
the
slightest
exaggeration
it
is
said
to
have
been
drawn
several
years
before
the
present
antislavery
agitation
began
by
a
northern
methodist
preacher
who
while
residing
at
the
south
had
an
opportunity
to
see
slaveholding
morals
manners
and
piety
with
his
own
eyes
shall
i
not
visit
for
these
things
saith
the
lord
shall
not
my
soul
be
avenged
on
such
a
nation
as
this
a
parody
come
saints
and
sinners
hear
me
tell
how
pious
priests
whip
jack
and
nell
and
women
buy
and
children
sell
and
preach
all
sinners
down
to
hell
and
sing
of
heavenly
union
theyll
bleat
and
baa
dona
like
goats
gorge
down
black
sheep
and
strain
at
motes
array
their
backs
in
fine
black
coats
then
seize
their
negroes
by
their
throats
and
choke
for
heavenly
union
theyll
church
you
if
you
sip
a
dram
and
damn
you
if
you
steal
a
lamb
yet
rob
old
tony
doll
and
sam
of
human
rights
and
bread
and
ham
kidnappers
heavenly
union
theyll
loudly
talk
of
christs
reward
and
bind
his
image
with
a
cord
and
scold
and
swing
the
lash
abhorred
and
sell
their
brother
in
the
lord
to
handcuffed
heavenly
union
theyll
read
and
sing
a
sacred
song
and
make
a
prayer
both
loud
and
long
and
teach
the
right
and
do
the
wrong
hailing
the
brother
sister
throng
with
words
of
heavenly
union
we
wonder
how
such
saints
can
sing
or
praise
the
lord
upon
the
wing
who
roar
and
scold
and
whip
and
sting
and
to
their
slaves
and
mammon
cling
in
guilty
conscience
union
theyll
raise
tobacco
corn
and
rye
and
drive
and
thieve
and
cheat
and
lie
and
lay
up
treasures
in
the
sky
by
making
switch
and
cowskin
fly
in
hope
of
heavenly
union
theyll
crack
old
tony
on
the
skull
and
preach
and
roar
like
bashan
bull
or
braying
ass
of
mischief
full
then
seize
old
jacob
by
the
wool
and
pull
for
heavenly
union

a
roaring
ranting
sleek
manthief
who
lived
on
mutton
veal
and
beef
yet
never
would
afford
relief
to
needy
sable
sons
of
grief
was
big
with
heavenly
union
love
not
the
world
the
preacher
said
and
winked
his
eye
and
shook
his
head
he
seized
on
tom
and
dick
and
ned
cut
short
their
meat
and
clothes
and
bread
yet
still
loved
heavenly
union
another
preacher
whining
spoke
of
one
whose
heart
for
sinners
broke
he
tied
old
nanny
to
an
oak
and
drew
the
blood
at
every
stroke
and
prayed
for
heavenly
union
two
others
oped
their
iron
jaws
and
waved
their
childrenstealing
paws
there
sat
their
children
in
gewgaws
by
stinting
negroes
backs
and
maws
they
kept
up
heavenly
union
all
good
from
jack
another
takes
and
entertains
their
flirts
and
rakes
who
dress
as
sleek
as
glossy
snakes
and
cram
their
mouths
with
sweetened
cakes
and
this
goes
down
for
union
sincerely
and
earnestly
hoping
that
this
little
book
may
do
something
toward
throwing
light
on
the
american
slave
system
and
hastening
the
glad
day
of
deliverance
to
the
millions
of
my
brethren

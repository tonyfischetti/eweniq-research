chapter
i
the
day
broke
gray
and
dull
the
clouds
hung
heavily
and
there
was
a
rawness
in
the
air
that
suggested
snow
a
woman
servant
came
into
a
room
in
which
a
child
was
sleeping
and
drew
the
curtains
she
glanced
mechanically
at
the
house
opposite
a
stucco
house
with
a
portico
and
went
to
the
childs
bed
wake
up
philip
she
said
she
pulled
down
the
bedclothes
took
him
in
her
arms
and
carried
him
downstairs
he
was
only
half
awake
your
mother
wants
you
she
said
she
opened
the
door
of
a
room
on
the
floor
below
and
took
the
child
over
to
a
bed
in
which
a
woman
was
lying
it
was
his
mother
she
stretched
out
her
arms
and
the
child
nestled
by
her
side
he
did
not
ask
why
he
had
been
awakened
the
woman
kissed
his
eyes
and
with
thin
small
hands
felt
the
warm
body
through
his
white
flannel
nightgown
she
pressed
him
closer
to
herself
are
you
sleepy
darling
she
said
her
voice
was
so
weak
that
it
seemed
to
come
already
from
a
great
distance
the
child
did
not
answer
but
smiled
comfortably
he
was
very
happy
in
the
large
warm
bed
with
those
soft
arms
about
him
he
tried
to
make
himself
smaller
still
as
he
cuddled
up
against
his
mother
and
he
kissed
her
sleepily
in
a
moment
he
closed
his
eyes
and
was
fast
asleep
the
doctor
came
forwards
and
stood
by
the
bedside
oh
dont
take
him
away
yet
she
moaned
the
doctor
without
answering
looked
at
her
gravely
knowing
she
would
not
be
allowed
to
keep
the
child
much
longer
the
woman
kissed
him
again
and
she
passed
her
hand
down
his
body
till
she
came
to
his
feet
she
held
the
right
foot
in
her
hand
and
felt
the
five
small
toes
and
then
slowly
passed
her
hand
over
the
left
one
she
gave
a
sob
whats
the
matter
said
the
doctor
youre
tired
she
shook
her
head
unable
to
speak
and
the
tears
rolled
down
her
cheeks
the
doctor
bent
down
let
me
take
him
she
was
too
weak
to
resist
his
wish
and
she
gave
the
child
up
the
doctor
handed
him
back
to
his
nurse
youd
better
put
him
back
in
his
own
bed
very
well
sir
the
little
boy
still
sleeping
was
taken
away
his
mother
sobbed
now
brokenheartedly
what
will
happen
to
him
poor
child
the
monthly
nurse
tried
to
quiet
her
and
presently
from
exhaustion
the
crying
ceased
the
doctor
walked
to
a
table
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
upon
which
under
a
towel
lay
the
body
of
a
stillborn
child
he
lifted
the
towel
and
looked
he
was
hidden
from
the
bed
by
a
screen
but
the
woman
guessed
what
he
was
doing
was
it
a
girl
or
a
boy
she
whispered
to
the
nurse
another
boy
the
woman
did
not
answer
in
a
moment
the
childs
nurse
came
back
she
approached
the
bed
master
philip
never
woke
up
she
said
there
was
a
pause
then
the
doctor
felt
his
patients
pulse
once
more

said

the

shook
his
head
chapter
ii
it
was
a
week
later
philip
was
sitting
on
the
floor
in
the
drawingroom
at
miss
watkins
house
in
onslow
gardens
he
was
an
only
child
and
used
to
amusing
himself
the
room
was
filled
with
massive
furniture
and
on
each
of
the
sofas
were
three
big
cushions
there
was
a
cushion
too
in
each
armchair
all
these
he
had
taken
and
with
the
help
of
the
gilt
rout
chairs
light
and
easy
to
move
had
made
an
elaborate
cave
in
which
he
could
hide
himself
from
the
red
indians
who
were
lurking
behind
the
curtains
he
put
his
ear
to
the
floor
and
listened
to
the
herd
of
buffaloes
that
raced
across
the
prairie
presently
hearing
the
door
open
he
held
his
breath
so
that
he
might
not
be
discovered
but
a
violent
hand
piled
away
a
chair
and
the
cushions
fell
down
you
naughty
boy
miss
watkin
will
be
cross
with
you
hulloa
emma
he
said
the
nurse
bent
down
and
kissed
him
then
began
to
shake
out
the
cushions
and
put
them
back
in
their
places
am
i
to
come
home
he
asked
yes
ive
come
to
fetch
you
youve
got
a
new
dress
on
it
was
in
eighteeneightyfive
and
she
wore
a
bustle
her
gown
was
of
black
velvet
with
tight
sleeves
and
sloping
shoulders
and
the
skirt
had
three
large
flounces
she
wore
a
black
bonnet
with
velvet
strings
she
hesitated
the
question
she
had
expected
did
not
come
and
so
she
could
not
give
the
answer
she
had
prepared
arent
you
going
to
ask
how
your
mamma
is
she
said
at
length
oh
i
forgot
how
is
mamma
now
she
was
ready
your
mamma
is
quite
well
and
happy
oh
i
am
glad

mammas

wont
ever
see
her
any
more
philip
did
not
know
what
she
meant
why
not
your
mammas
in
heaven
she
began
to
cry
and
philip
though
he
did
not
quite
under
stand
cried
too
emma
was
a
tall
bigboned
woman
with
fair
hair
and
large
features
she
came
from
devonshire
and
notwithstanding
her
many
years
of
service
in
london
had
never
lost
the
breadth
of
her
accent
her
tears
increased
her
emotion
and
she
pressed
the
little
boy
to
her
heart
she
felt
vaguely
the
pity
of
that
child
deprived
of
the
only
love
in
the
world
that
is
quite
unselfish
it
seemed
dreadful
that
he
must
be
handed
over
to
strangers
but
in
a
little
while
she
pulled
herself
together
your
uncle
william
is
waiting
in
to
see
you
she
said
go
and
say
goodbye
to
miss
watkin
and
well
go
home
i
dont
want
to
say
goodbye
he
answered
instinctively
anxious
to
hide
his
tears
very
well
run
upstairs
and
get
your
hat
he
fetched
it
and
when
he
came
down
emma
was
waiting
for
him
in
the
hall
he
heard
the
sound
of
voices
in
the
study
behind
the
diningroom
he
paused
he
knew
that
miss
watkin
and
her
sister
were
talking
to
friends
and
it
seemed
to
himhe
was
nine
years
oldthat
if
he
went
in
they
would
be
sorry
for
him
i
think
ill
go
and
say
goodbye
to
miss
watkin
i
think
youd
better
said
emma
go
in
and
tell
them
im
coming
he
said
he
wished
to
make
the
most
of
his
opportunity
emma
knocked
at
the
door
and
walked
in
he
heard
her
speak
master
philip
wants
to
say
goodbye
to
you
miss
there
was
a
sudden
hush
of
the
conversation
and
philip
limped
in
henrietta
watkin
was
a
stout
woman
with
a
red
face
and
dyed
hair
in
those
days
to
dye
the
hair
excited
comment
and
philip
had
heard
much
gossip
at
home
when
his
godmothers
changed
colour
she
lived
with
an
elder
sister
who
had
resigned
herself
contentedly
to
old
age
two
ladies
whom
philip
did
not
know
were
calling
and
they
looked
at
him
curiously
my
poor
child
said
miss
watkin
opening
her
arms
she
began
to
cry
philip
understood
now
why
she
had
not
been
in
to
luncheon
and
why
she
wore
a
black
dress
she
could
not
speak
ive
got
to
go
home
said
philip
at
last
he
disengaged
himself
from
miss
watkins
arms
and
she
kissed
him
again
then
he
went
to
her
sister
and
bade
her
goodbye
too
one
of
the
strange
ladies
asked
if
she
might
kiss
him
and
he
gravely
gave
her
permission
though
crying
he
keenly
enjoyed
the
sensation
he
was
causing
he
would
have
been
glad
to
stay
a
little
longer
to
be
made
much
of
but
felt
they
expected
him
to
go
so
he
said
that
emma
was
waiting
for
him
he
went
out
of
the
room
emma
had
gone
downstairs
to
speak
with
a
friend
in
the
basement
and
he
waited
for
her
on
the
landing
he
heard
henrietta
watkins
voice
his
mother
was
my
greatest
friend
i
cant
bear
to
think
that
shes
dead
you
oughtnt
to
have
gone
to
the
funeral
henrietta
said
her
sister
i
knew
it
would
upset
you
then
one
of
the
strangers
spoke
poor
little
boy
its
dreadful
to
think
of
him
quite
alone
in
the
world
i
see
he
limps
yes
hes
got
a
clubfoot
it
was
such
a
grief
to
his
mother
then
emma
came
back
they
called
a
hansom
and
she
told
the
driver
where
to
go
chapter
iii
when
they
reached
the
house
mrs
carey
had
died
init
was
in
a
dreary
respectable
street
between
notting
hill
gate
and
high
street
kensingtonemma
led
philip
into
the
drawingroom
his
uncle
was
writing
letters
of
thanks
for
the
wreaths
which
had
been
sent
one
of
them
which
had
arrived
too
late
for
the
funeral
lay
in
its
cardboard
box
on
the
halltable
heres
master
philip
said
emma
mr
carey
stood
up
slowly
and
shook
hands
with
the
little
boy
then
on
second
thoughts
he
bent
down
and
kissed
his
forehead
he
was
a
man
of
somewhat
less
than
average
height
inclined
to
corpulence
with
his
hair
worn
long
arranged
over
the
scalp
so
as
to
conceal
his
baldness
he
was
cleanshaven
his
features
were
regular
and
it
was
possible
to
imagine
that
in
his
youth
he
had
been
goodlooking
on
his
watchchain
he
wore
a
gold
cross
youre
going
to
live
with
me
now
philip
said
mr
carey
shall
you
like
that
two
years
before
philip
had
been
sent
down
to
stay
at
the
vicarage
after
an
attack
of
chickenpox
but
there
remained
with
him
a
recollection
of
an
attic
and
a
large
garden
rather
than
of
his
uncle
and
aunt
yes
you
must
look
upon
me
and
your
aunt
louisa
as
your
father
and
mother
the
childs
mouth
trembled
a
little
he
reddened
but
did
not
answer
your
dear
mother
left
you
in
my
charge
mr
carey
had
no
great
ease
in
expressing
himself
when
the
news
came
that
his
sisterinlaw
was
dying
he
set
off
at
once
for
london
but
on
the
way
thought
of
nothing
but
the
disturbance
in
his
life
that
would
be
caused
if
her
death
forced
him
to
undertake
the
care
of
her
son
he
was
well
over
fifty
and
his
wife
to
whom
he
had
been
married
for
thirty
years
was
childless
he
did
not
look
forward
with
any
pleasure
to
the
presence
of
a
small
boy
who
might
be
noisy
and
rough
he
had
never
much
liked
his
sisterinlaw
im
going
to
take
you
down
to
blackstable
tomorrow
he
said
with
emma
the
child
put
his
hand
in
hers
and
she
pressed
it
im
afraid
emma
must
go
away
said
mr
carey
but
i
want
emma
to
come
with
me
philip
began
to
cry
and
the
nurse
could
not
help
crying
too
mr
carey
looked
at
them
helplessly
i
think
youd
better
leave
me
alone
with
master
philip
for
a
moment
very
good
sir
though
philip
clung
to
her
she
released
herself
gently
mr
carey
took
the
boy
on
his
knee
and
put
his
arm
round
him
you
mustnt
cry
he
said
youre
too
old
to
have
a
nurse
now
we
must
see
about
sending
you
to
school
i
want
emma
to
come
with
me
the
child
repeated
it
costs
too
much
money
philip
your
father
didnt
leave
very
much
and
i
dont
know
whats
become
of
it
you
must
look
at
every
penny
you
spend
mr
carey
had
called
the
day
before
on
the
family
solicitor
philips
father
was
a
surgeon
in
good
practice
and
his
hospital
appointments
suggested
an
established
position
so
that
it
was
a
surprise
on
his
sudden
death
from
bloodpoisoning
to
find
that
he
had
left
his
widow
little
more
than
his
life
insurance
and
what
could
be
got
for
the
lease
of
their
house
in
bruton
street
this
was
six
months
ago
and
mrs
carey
already
in
delicate
health
finding
herself
with
child
had
lost
her
head
and
accepted
for
the
lease
the
first
offer
that
was
made
she
stored
her
furniture
and
at
a
rent
which
the
parson
thought
outrageous
took
a
furnished
house
for
a
year
so
that
she
might
suffer
from
no
inconvenience
till
her
child
was
born
but
she
had
never
been
used
to
the
management
of
money
and
was
unable
to
adapt
her
expenditure
to
her
altered
circumstances
the
little
she
had
slipped
through
her
fingers
in
one
way
and
another
so
that
now
when
all
expenses
were
paid
not
much
more
than
two
thousand
pounds
remained
to
support
the
boy
till
he
was
able
to
earn
his
own
living
it
was
impossible
to
explain
all
this
to
philip
and
he
was
sobbing
still
youd
better
go
to
emma
mr
carey
said
feeling
that
she
could
console
the
child
better
than
anyone
without
a
word
philip
slipped
off
his
uncles
knee
but
mr
carey
stopped
him
we
must
go
tomorrow
because
on
saturday
ive
got
to
prepare
my
sermon
and
you
must
tell
emma
to
get
your
things
ready
today
you
can
bring
all
your
toys
and
if
you
want
anything
to
remember
your
father
and
mother
by
you
can
take
one
thing
for
each
of
them
everything
else
is
going
to
be
sold
the
boy
slipped
out
of
the
room
mr
carey
was
unused
to
work
and
he
turned
to
his
correspondence
with
resentment
on
one
side
of
the
desk
was
a
bundle
of
bills
and
these
filled
him
with
irritation
one
especially
seemed
preposterous
immediately
after
mrs
careys
death
emma
had
ordered
from
the
florist
masses
of
white
flowers
for
the
room
in
which
the
dead
woman
lay
it
was
sheer
waste
of
money
emma
took
far
too
much
upon
herself
even
if
there
had
been
no
financial
necessity
he
would
have
dismissed
her
but
philip
went
to
her
and
hid
his
face
in
her
bosom
and
wept
as
though
his
heart
would
break
and
she
feeling
that
he
was
almost
her
own
sonshe
had
taken
him
when
he
was
a
month
oldconsoled
him
with
soft
words
she
promised
that
she
would
come
and
see
him
sometimes
and
that
she
would
never
forget
him
and
she
told
him
about
the
country
he
was
going
to
and
about
her
own
home
in
devonshireher
father
kept
a
turnpike
on
the
highroad
that
led
to
exeter
and
there
were
pigs
in
the
sty
and
there
was
a
cow
and
the
cow
had
just
had
a
calftill
philip
forgot
his
tears
and
grew
excited
at
the
thought
of
his
approaching
journey
presently
she
put
him
down
for
there
was
much
to
be
done
and
he
helped
her
to
lay
out
his
clothes
on
the
bed
she
sent
him
into
the
nursery
to
gather
up
his
toys
and
in
a
little
while
he
was
playing
happily
but
at
last
he
grew
tired
of
being
alone
and
went
back
to
the
bedroom
in
which
emma
was
now
putting
his
things
into
a
big
tin
box
he
remembered
then
that
his
uncle
had
said
he
might
take
something
to
remember
his
father
and
mother
by
he
told
emma
and
asked
her
what
he
should
take
youd
better
go
into
the
drawingroom
and
see
what
you
fancy
uncle
williams
there
never
mind
that
theyre
your
own
things
now
philip
went
downstairs
slowly
and
found
the
door
open
mr
carey
had
left
the
room
philip
walked
slowly
round
they
had
been
in
the
house
so
short
a
time
that
there
was
little
in
it
that
had
a
particular
interest
to
him
it
was
a
strangers
room
and
philip
saw
nothing
that
struck
his
fancy
but
he
knew
which
were
his
mothers
things
and
which
belonged
to
the
landlord
and
presently
fixed
on
a
little
clock
that
he
had
once
heard
his
mother
say
she
liked
with
this
he
walked
again
rather
disconsolately
upstairs
outside
the
door
of
his
mothers
bedroom
he
stopped
and
listened
though
no
one
had
told
him
not
to
go
in
he
had
a
feeling
that
it
would
be
wrong
to
do
so
he
was
a
little
frightened
and
his
heart
beat
uncomfortably
but
at
the
same
time
something
impelled
him
to
turn
the
handle
he
turned
it
very
gently
as
if
to
prevent
anyone
within
from
hearing
and
then
slowly
pushed
the
door
open
he
stood
on
the
threshold
for
a
moment
before
he
had
the
courage
to
enter
he
was
not
frightened
now
but
it
seemed
strange
he
closed
the
door
behind
him
the
blinds
were
drawn
and
the
room
in
the
cold
light
of
a
january
afternoon
was
dark
on
the
dressingtable
were
mrs
careys
brushes
and
the
hand
mirror
in
a
little
tray
were
hairpins
there
was
a
photograph
of
himself
on
the
chimneypiece
and
one
of
his
father
he
had
often
been
in
the
room
when
his
mother
was
not
in
it
but
now
it
seemed
different
there
was
something
curious
in
the
look
of
the
chairs
the
bed
was
made
as
though
someone
were
going
to
sleep
in
it
that
night
and
in
a
case
on
the
pillow
was
a
nightdress
philip
opened
a
large
cupboard
filled
with
dresses
and
stepping
in
took
as
many
of
them
as
he
could
in
his
arms
and
buried
his
face
in
them
they
smelt
of
the
scent
his
mother
used
then
he
pulled
open
the
drawers
filled
with
his
mothers
things
and
looked
at
them
there
were
lavender
bags
among
the
linen
and
their
scent
was
fresh
and
pleasant
the
strangeness
of
the
room
left
it
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
his
mother
had
just
gone
out
for
a
walk
she
would
be
in
presently
and
would
come
upstairs
to
have
nursery
tea
with
him
and
he
seemed
to
feel
her
kiss
on
his
lips
it
was
not
true
that
he
would
never
see
her
again
it
was
not
true
simply
because
it
was
impossible
he
climbed
up
on
the
bed
and
put
his
head
on
the
pillow
he
lay
there
quite
still
chapter
iv
philip
parted
from
emma
with
tears
but
the
journey
to
blackstable
amused
him
and
when
they
arrived
he
was
resigned
and
cheerful
blackstable
was
sixty
miles
from
london
giving
their
luggage
to
a
porter
mr
carey
set
out
to
walk
with
philip
to
the
vicarage
it
took
them
little
more
than
five
minutes
and
when
they
reached
it
philip
suddenly
remembered
the
gate
it
was
red
and
fivebarred
it
swung
both
ways
on
easy
hinges
and
it
was
possible
though
forbidden
to
swing
backwards
and
forwards
on
it
they
walked
through
the
garden
to
the
frontdoor
this
was
only
used
by
visitors
and
on
sundays
and
on
special
occasions
as
when
the
vicar
went
up
to
london
or
came
back
the
traffic
of
the
house
took
place
through
a
sidedoor
and
there
was
a
back
door
as
well
for
the
gardener
and
for
beggars
and
tramps
it
was
a
fairly
large
house
of
yellow
brick
with
a
red
roof
built
about
five
and
twenty
years
before
in
an
ecclesiastical
style
the
frontdoor
was
like
a
church
porch
and
the
drawingroom
windows
were
gothic
mrs
carey
knowing
by
what
train
they
were
coming
waited
in
the
drawingroom
and
listened
for
the
click
of
the
gate
when
she
heard
it
she
went
to
the
door
theres
aunt
louisa
said
mr
carey
when
he
saw
her
run
and
give
her
a
kiss
philip
started
to
run
awkwardly
trailing
his
clubfoot
and
then
stopped
mrs
carey
was
a
little
shrivelled
woman
of
the
same
age
as
her
husband
with
a
face
extraordinarily
filled
with
deep
wrinkles
and
pale
blue
eyes
her
gray
hair
was
arranged
in
ringlets
according
to
the
fashion
of
her
youth
she
wore
a
black
dress
and
her
only
ornament
was
a
gold
chain
from
which
hung
a
cross
she
had
a
shy
manner
and
a
gentle
voice
did
you
walk
william
she
said
almost
reproachfully
as
she
kissed
her
husband
i
didnt
think
of
it
he
answered
with
a
glance
at
his
nephew
it
didnt
hurt
you
to
walk
philip
did
it
she
asked
the
child
no
i
always
walk
he
was
a
little
surprised
at
their
conversation
aunt
louisa
told
him
to
come
in
and
they
entered
the
hall
it
was
paved
with
red
and
yellow
tiles
on
which
alternately
were
a
greek
cross
and
the
lamb
of
god
an
imposing
staircase
led
out
of
the
hall
it
was
of
polished
pine
with
a
peculiar
smell
and
had
been
put
in
because
fortunately
when
the
church
was
reseated
enough
wood
remained
over
the
balusters
were
decorated
with
emblems
of
the
four
evangelists
ive
had
the
stove
lighted
as
i
thought
youd
be
cold
after
your
journey
said
mrs
carey
it
was
a
large
black
stove
that
stood
in
the
hall
and
was
only
lighted
if
the
weather
was
very
bad
and
the
vicar
had
a
cold
it
was
not
lighted
if
mrs
carey
had
a
cold
coal
was
expensive
besides
mary
ann
the
maid
didnt
like
fires
all
over
the
place
if
they
wanted
all
them
fires
they
must
keep
a
second
girl
in
the
winter
mr
and
mrs
carey
lived
in
the
diningroom
so
that
one
fire
should
do
and
in
the
summer
they
could
not
get
out
of
the
habit
so
the
drawingroom
was
used
only
by
mr
carey
on
sunday
afternoons
for
his
nap
but
every
saturday
he
had
a
fire
in
the
study
so
that
he
could
write
his
sermon
aunt
louisa
took
philip
upstairs
and
showed
him
into
a
tiny
bedroom
that
looked
out
on
the
drive
immediately
in
front
of
the
window
was
a
large
tree
which
philip
remembered
now
because
the
branches
were
so
low
that
it
was
possible
to
climb
quite
high
up
it
a
small
room
for
a
small
boy
said
mrs
carey
you
wont
be
frightened
at
sleeping
alone
oh
no
on
his
first
visit
to
the
vicarage
he
had
come
with
his
nurse
and
mrs
carey
had
had
little
to
do
with
him
she
looked
at
him
now
with
some
uncertainty
can
you
wash
your
own
hands
or
shall
i
wash
them
for
you
i
can
wash
myself
he
answered
firmly
well
i
shall
look
at
them
when
you
come
down
to
tea
said
mrs
carey
she
knew
nothing
about
children
after
it
was
settled
that
philip
should
come
down
to
blackstable
mrs
carey
had
thought
much
how
she
should
treat
him
she
was
anxious
to
do
her
duty
but
now
he
was
there
she
found
herself
just
as
shy
of
him
as
he
was
of
her
she
hoped
he
would
not
be
noisy
and
rough
because
her
husband
did
not
like
rough
and
noisy
boys
mrs
carey
made
an
excuse
to
leave
philip
alone
but
in
a
moment
came
back
and
knocked
at
the
door
she
asked
him
without
coming
in
if
he
could
pour
out
the
water
himself
then
she
went
downstairs
and
rang
the
bell
for
tea
the
diningroom
large
and
wellproportioned
had
windows
on
two
sides
of
it
with
heavy
curtains
of
red
rep
there
was
a
big
table
in
the
middle
and
at
one
end
an
imposing
mahogany
sideboard
with
a
lookingglass
in
it
in
one
corner
stood
a
harmonium
on
each
side
of
the
fireplace
were
chairs
covered
in
stamped
leather
each
with
an
antimacassar
one
had
arms
and
was
called
the
husband
and
the
other
had
none
and
was
called
the
wife
mrs
carey
never
sat
in
the
armchair
she
said
she
preferred
a
chair
that
was
not
too
comfortable
there
was
always
a
lot
to
do
and
if
her
chair
had
had
arms
she
might
not
be
so
ready
to
leave
it
mr
carey
was
making
up
the
fire
when
philip
came
in
and
he
pointed
out
to
his
nephew
that
there
were
two
pokers
one
was
large
and
bright
and
polished
and
unused
and
was
called
the
vicar
and
the
other
which
was
much
smaller
and
had
evidently
passed
through
many
fires
was
called
the
curate
what
are
we
waiting
for
said
mr
carey
i
told
mary
ann
to
make
you
an
egg
i
thought
youd
be
hungry
after
your
journey
mrs
carey
thought
the
journey
from
london
to
blackstable
very
tiring
she
seldom
travelled
herself
for
the
living
was
only
three
hundred
a
year
and
when
her
husband
wanted
a
holiday
since
there
was
not
money
for
two
he
went
by
himself
he
was
very
fond
of
church
congresses
and
usually
managed
to
go
up
to
london
once
a
year
and
once
he
had
been
to
paris
for
the
exhibition
and
two
or
three
times
to
switzerland
mary
ann
brought
in
the
egg
and
they
sat
down
the
chair
was
much
too
low
for
philip
and
for
a
moment
neither
mr
carey
nor
his
wife
knew
what
to
do
ill
put
some
books
under
him
said
mary
ann
she
took
from
the
top
of
the
harmonium
the
large
bible
and
the
prayerbook
from
which
the
vicar
was
accustomed
to
read
prayers
and
put
them
on
philips
chair
oh
william
he
cant
sit
on
the
bible
said
mrs
carey
in
a
shocked
tone
couldnt
you
get
him
some
books
out
of
the
study
mr
carey
considered
the
question
for
an
instant
i
dont
think
it
matters
this
once
if
you
put
the
prayerbook
on
the
top
mary
ann
he
said
the
book
of
common
prayer
is
the
composition
of
men
like
ourselves
it
has
no
claim
to
divine
authorship
i
hadnt
thought
of
that
william
said
aunt
louisa
philip
perched
himself
on
the
books
and
the
vicar
having
said
grace
cut
the
top
off
his
egg
there
he
said
handing
it
to
philip
you
can
eat
my
top
if
you
like
philip
would
have
liked
an
egg
to
himself
but
he
was
not
offered
one
so
took
what
he
could
how
have
the
chickens
been
laying
since
i
went
away
asked
the
vicar
oh
theyve
been
dreadful
only
one
or
two
a
day
how
did
you
like
that
top
philip
asked
his
uncle
very
much
thank
you
you
shall
have
another
one
on
sunday
afternoon
mr
carey
always
had
a
boiled
egg
at
tea
on
sunday
so
that
he
might
be
fortified
for
the
evening
service
chapter
v
philip
came
gradually
to
know
the
people
he
was
to
live
with
and
by
fragments
of
conversation
some
of
it
not
meant
for
his
ears
learned
a
good
deal
both
about
himself
and
about
his
dead
parents
philips
father
had
been
much
younger
than
the
vicar
of
blackstable
after
a
brilliant
career
at
st
lukes
hospital
he
was
put
on
the
staff
and
presently
began
to
earn
money
in
considerable
sums
he
spent
it
freely
when
the
parson
set
about
restoring
his
church
and
asked
his
brother
for
a
subscription
he
was
surprised
by
receiving
a
couple
of
hundred
pounds
mr
carey
thrifty
by
inclination
and
economical
by
necessity
accepted
it
with
mingled
feelings
he
was
envious
of
his
brother
because
he
could
afford
to
give
so
much
pleased
for
the
sake
of
his
church
and
vaguely
irritated
by
a
generosity
which
seemed
almost
ostentatious
then
henry
carey
married
a
patient
a
beautiful
girl
but
penniless
an
orphan
with
no
near
relations
but
of
good
family
and
there
was
an
array
of
fine
friends
at
the
wedding
the
parson
on
his
visits
to
her
when
he
came
to
london
held
himself
with
reserve
he
felt
shy
with
her
and
in
his
heart
he
resented
her
great
beauty
she
dressed
more
magnificently
than
became
the
wife
of
a
hardworking
surgeon
and
the
charming
furniture
of
her
house
the
flowers
among
which
she
lived
even
in
winter
suggested
an
extravagance
which
he
deplored
he
heard
her
talk
of
entertainments
she
was
going
to
and
as
he
told
his
wife
on
getting
home
again
it
was
impossible
to
accept
hospitality
without
making
some
return
he
had
seen
grapes
in
the
diningroom
that
must
have
cost
at
least
eight
shillings
a
pound
and
at
luncheon
he
had
been
given
asparagus
two
months
before
it
was
ready
in
the
vicarage
garden
now
all
he
had
anticipated
was
come
to
pass
the
vicar
felt
the
satisfaction
of
the
prophet
who
saw
fire
and
brimstone
consume
the
city
which
would
not
mend
its
way
to
his
warning
poor
philip
was
practically
penniless
and
what
was
the
good
of
his
mothers
fine
friends
now
he
heard
that
his
fathers
extravagance
was
really
criminal
and
it
was
a
mercy
that
providence
had
seen
fit
to
take
his
dear
mother
to
itself
she
had
no
more
idea
of
money
than
a
child
when
philip
had
been
a
week
at
blackstable
an
incident
happened
which
seemed
to
irritate
his
uncle
very
much
one
morning
he
found
on
the
breakfast
table
a
small
packet
which
had
been
sent
on
by
post
from
the
late
mrs
careys
house
in
london
it
was
addressed
to
her
when
the
parson
opened
it
he
found
a
dozen
photographs
of
mrs
carey
they
showed
the
head
and
shoulders
only
and
her
hair
was
more
plainly
done
than
usual
low
on
the
forehead
which
gave
her
an
unusual
look
the
face
was
thin
and
worn
but
no
illness
could
impair
the
beauty
of
her
features
there
was
in
the
large
dark
eyes
a
sadness
which
philip
did
not
remember
the
first
sight
of
the
dead
woman
gave
mr
carey
a
little
shock
but
this
was
quickly
followed
by
perplexity
the
photographs
seemed
quite
recent
and
he
could
not
imagine
who
had
ordered
them
dyou
know
anything
about
these
philip
he
asked
i
remember
mamma
said
shed
been
taken
he
answered
miss
watkin
scolded
her
she
said
i
wanted
the
boy
to
have
something
to
remember
me
by
when
he
grows
up
mr
carey
looked
at
philip
for
an
instant
the
child
spoke
in
a
clear
treble
he
recalled
the
words
but
they
meant
nothing
to
him
youd
better
take
one
of
the
photographs
and
keep
it
in
your
room
said
mr
carey
ill
put
the
others
away
he
sent
one
to
miss
watkin
and
she
wrote
and
explained
how
they
came
to
be
taken
one
day
mrs
carey
was
lying
in
bed
but
she
was
feeling
a
little
better
than
usual
and
the
doctor
in
the
morning
had
seemed
hopeful
emma
had
taken
the
child
out
and
the
maids
were
downstairs
in
the
basement
suddenly
mrs
carey
felt
desperately
alone
in
the
world
a
great
fear
seized
her
that
she
would
not
recover
from
the
confinement
which
she
was
expecting
in
a
fortnight
her
son
was
nine
years
old
how
could
he
be
expected
to
remember
her
she
could
not
bear
to
think
that
he
would
grow
up
and
forget
forget
her
utterly
and
she
had
loved
him
so
passionately
because
he
was
weakly
and
deformed
and
because
he
was
her
child
she
had
no
photographs
of
herself
taken
since
her
marriage
and
that
was
ten
years
before
she
wanted
her
son
to
know
what
she
looked
like
at
the
end
he
could
not
forget
her
then
not
forget
utterly
she
knew
that
if
she
called
her
maid
and
told
her
she
wanted
to
get
up
the
maid
would
prevent
her
and
perhaps
send
for
the
doctor
and
she
had
not
the
strength
now
to
struggle
or
argue
she
got
out
of
bed
and
began
to
dress
herself
she
had
been
on
her
back
so
long
that
her
legs
gave
way
beneath
her
and
then
the
soles
of
her
feet
tingled
so
that
she
could
hardly
bear
to
put
them
to
the
ground
but
she
went
on
she
was
unused
to
doing
her
own
hair
and
when
she
raised
her
arms
and
began
to
brush
it
she
felt
faint
she
could
never
do
it
as
her
maid
did
it
was
beautiful
hair
very
fine
and
of
a
deep
rich
gold
her
eyebrows
were
straight
and
dark
she
put
on
a
black
skirt
but
chose
the
bodice
of
the
evening
dress
which
she
liked
best
it
was
of
a
white
damask
which
was
fashionable
in
those
days
she
looked
at
herself
in
the
glass
her
face
was
very
pale
but
her
skin
was
clear
she
had
never
had
much
colour
and
this
had
always
made
the
redness
of
her
beautiful
mouth
emphatic
she
could
not
restrain
a
sob
but
she
could
not
afford
to
be
sorry
for
herself
she
was
feeling
already
desperately
tired
and
she
put
on
the
furs
which
henry
had
given
her
the
christmas
beforeshe
had
been
so
proud
of
them
and
so
happy
thenand
slipped
downstairs
with
beating
heart
she
got
safely
out
of
the
house
and
drove
to
a
photographer
she
paid
for
a
dozen
photographs
she
was
obliged
to
ask
for
a
glass
of
water
in
the
middle
of
the
sitting
and
the
assistant
seeing
she
was
ill
suggested
that
she
should
come
another
day
but
she
insisted
on
staying
till
the
end
at
last
it
was
finished
and
she
drove
back
again
to
the
dingy
little
house
in
kensington
which
she
hated
with
all
her
heart
it
was
a
horrible
house
to
die
in
she
found
the
front
door
open
and
when
she
drove
up
the
maid
and
emma
ran
down
the
steps
to
help
her
they
had
been
frightened
when
they
found
her
room
empty
at
first
they
thought
she
must
have
gone
to
miss
watkin
and
the
cook
was
sent
round
miss
watkin
came
back
with
her
and
was
waiting
anxiously
in
the
drawingroom
she
came
downstairs
now
full
of
anxiety
and
reproaches
but
the
exertion
had
been
more
than
mrs
carey
was
fit
for
and
when
the
occasion
for
firmness
no
longer
existed
she
gave
way
she
fell
heavily
into
emmas
arms
and
was
carried
upstairs
she
remained
unconscious
for
a
time
that
seemed
incredibly
long
to
those
that
watched
her
and
the
doctor
hurriedly
sent
for
did
not
come
it
was
next
day
when
she
was
a
little
better
that
miss
watkin
got
some
explanation
out
of
her
philip
was
playing
on
the
floor
of
his
mothers
bedroom
and
neither
of
the
ladies
paid
attention
to
him
he
only
understood
vaguely
what
they
were
talking
about
and
he
could
not
have
said
why
those
words
remained
in
his
memory
i
wanted
the
boy
to
have
something
to
remember
me
by
when
he
grows
up
i
cant
make
out
why
she
ordered
a
dozen
said
mr
carey
two
would
have
done
chapter
vi
one
day
was
very
like
another
at
the
vicarage
soon
after
breakfast
mary
ann
brought
in
the
times
mr
carey
shared
it
with
two
neighbours
he
had
it
from
ten
till
one
when
the
gardener
took
it
over
to
mr
ellis
at
the
limes
with
whom
it
remained
till
seven
then
it
was
taken
to
miss
brooks
at
the
manor
house
who
since
she
got
it
late
had
the
advantage
of
keeping
it
in
summer
mrs
carey
when
she
was
making
jam
often
asked
her
for
a
copy
to
cover
the
pots
with
when
the
vicar
settled
down
to
his
paper
his
wife
put
on
her
bonnet
and
went
out
to
do
the
shopping
philip
accompanied
her
blackstable
was
a
fishing
village
it
consisted
of
a
high
street
in
which
were
the
shops
the
bank
the
doctors
house
and
the
houses
of
two
or
three
coalship
owners
round
the
little
harbor
were
shabby
streets
in
which
lived
fishermen
and
poor
people
but
since
they
went
to
chapel
they
were
of
no
account
when
mrs
carey
passed
the
dissenting
ministers
in
the
street
she
stepped
over
to
the
other
side
to
avoid
meeting
them
but
if
there
was
not
time
for
this
fixed
her
eyes
on
the
pavement
it
was
a
scandal
to
which
the
vicar
had
never
resigned
himself
that
there
were
three
chapels
in
the
high
street
he
could
not
help
feeling
that
the
law
should
have
stepped
in
to
prevent
their
erection
shopping
in
blackstable
was
not
a
simple
matter
for
dissent
helped
by
the
fact
that
the
parish
church
was
two
miles
from
the
town
was
very
common
and
it
was
necessary
to
deal
only
with
churchgoers
mrs
carey
knew
perfectly
that
the
vicarage
custom
might
make
all
the
difference
to
a
tradesmans
faith
there
were
two
butchers
who
went
to
church
and
they
would
not
understand
that
the
vicar
could
not
deal
with
both
of
them
at
once
nor
were
they
satisfied
with
his
simple
plan
of
going
for
six
months
to
one
and
for
six
months
to
the
other
the
butcher
who
was
not
sending
meat
to
the
vicarage
constantly
threatened
not
to
come
to
church
and
the
vicar
was
sometimes
obliged
to
make
a
threat
it
was
very
wrong
of
him
not
to
come
to
church
but
if
he
carried
iniquity
further
and
actually
went
to
chapel
then
of
course
excellent
as
his
meat
was
mr
carey
would
be
forced
to
leave
him
for
ever
mrs
carey
often
stopped
at
the
bank
to
deliver
a
message
to
josiah
graves
the
manager
who
was
choirmaster
treasurer
and
churchwarden
he
was
a
tall
thin
man
with
a
sallow
face
and
a
long
nose
his
hair
was
very
white
and
to
philip
he
seemed
extremely
old
he
kept
the
parish
accounts
arranged
the
treats
for
the
choir
and
the
schools
though
there
was
no
organ
in
the
parish
church
it
was
generally
considered
in
blackstable
that
the
choir
he
led
was
the
best
in
kent
and
when
there
was
any
ceremony
such
as
a
visit
from
the
bishop
for
confirmation
or
from
the
rural
dean
to
preach
at
the
harvest
thanksgiving
he
made
the
necessary
preparations
but
he
had
no
hesitation
in
doing
all
manner
of
things
without
more
than
a
perfunctory
consultation
with
the
vicar
and
the
vicar
though
always
ready
to
be
saved
trouble
much
resented
the
churchwardens
managing
ways
he
really
seemed
to
look
upon
himself
as
the
most
important
person
in
the
parish
mr
carey
constantly
told
his
wife
that
if
josiah
graves
did
not
take
care
he
would
give
him
a
good
rap
over
the
knuckles
one
day
but
mrs
carey
advised
him
to
bear
with
josiah
graves
he
meant
well
and
it
was
not
his
fault
if
he
was
not
quite
a
gentleman
the
vicar
finding
his
comfort
in
the
practice
of
a
christian
virtue
exercised
forbearance
but
he
revenged
himself
by
calling
the
churchwarden
bismarck
behind
his
back
once
there
had
been
a
serious
quarrel
between
the
pair
and
mrs
carey
still
thought
of
that
anxious
time
with
dismay
the
conservative
candidate
had
announced
his
intention
of
addressing
a
meeting
at
blackstable
and
josiah
graves
having
arranged
that
it
should
take
place
in
the
mission
hall
went
to
mr
carey
and
told
him
that
he
hoped
he
would
say
a
few
words
it
appeared
that
the
candidate
had
asked
josiah
graves
to
take
the
chair
this
was
more
than
mr
carey
could
put
up
with
he
had
firm
views
upon
the
respect
which
was
due
to
the
cloth
and
it
was
ridiculous
for
a
churchwarden
to
take
the
chair
at
a
meeting
when
the
vicar
was
there
he
reminded
josiah
graves
that
parson
meant
person
that
is
the
vicar
was
the
person
of
the
parish
josiah
graves
answered
that
he
was
the
first
to
recognise
the
dignity
of
the
church
but
this
was
a
matter
of
politics
and
in
his
turn
he
reminded
the
vicar
that
their
blessed
saviour
had
enjoined
upon
them
to
render
unto
caesar
the
things
that
were
caesars
to
this
mr
carey
replied
that
the
devil
could
quote
scripture
to
his
purpose
himself
had
sole
authority
over
the
mission
hall
and
if
he
were
not
asked
to
be
chairman
he
would
refuse
the
use
of
it
for
a
political
meeting
josiah
graves
told
mr
carey
that
he
might
do
as
he
chose
and
for
his
part
he
thought
the
wesleyan
chapel
would
be
an
equally
suitable
place
then
mr
carey
said
that
if
josiah
graves
set
foot
in
what
was
little
better
than
a
heathen
temple
he
was
not
fit
to
be
churchwarden
in
a
christian
parish
josiah
graves
thereupon
resigned
all
his
offices
and
that
very
evening
sent
to
the
church
for
his
cassock
and
surplice
his
sister
miss
graves
who
kept
house
for
him
gave
up
her
secretaryship
of
the
maternity
club
which
provided
the
pregnant
poor
with
flannel
baby
linen
coals
and
five
shillings
mr
carey
said
he
was
at
last
master
in
his
own
house
but
soon
he
found
that
he
was
obliged
to
see
to
all
sorts
of
things
that
he
knew
nothing
about
and
josiah
graves
after
the
first
moment
of
irritation
discovered
that
he
had
lost
his
chief
interest
in
life
mrs
carey
and
miss
graves
were
much
distressed
by
the
quarrel
they
met
after
a
discreet
exchange
of
letters
and
made
up
their
minds
to
put
the
matter
right
they
talked
one
to
her
husband
the
other
to
her
brother
from
morning
till
night
and
since
they
were
persuading
these
gentlemen
to
do
what
in
their
hearts
they
wanted
after
three
weeks
of
anxiety
a
reconciliation
was
effected
it
was
to
both
their
interests
but
they
ascribed
it
to
a
common
love
for
their
redeemer
the
meeting
was
held
at
the
mission
hall
and
the
doctor
was
asked
to
be
chairman
mr
carey
and
josiah
graves
both
made
speeches
when
mrs
carey
had
finished
her
business
with
the
banker
she
generally
went
upstairs
to
have
a
little
chat
with
his
sister
and
while
the
ladies
talked
of
parish
matters
the
curate
or
the
new
bonnet
of
mrs
wilsonmr
wilson
was
the
richest
man
in
blackstable
he
was
thought
to
have
at
least
five
hundred
a
year
and
he
had
married
his
cookphilip
sat
demurely
in
the
stiff
parlour
used
only
to
receive
visitors
and
busied
himself
with
the
restless
movements
of
goldfish
in
a
bowl
the
windows
were
never
opened
except
to
air
the
room
for
a
few
minutes
in
the
morning
and
it
had
a
stuffy
smell
which
seemed
to
philip
to
have
a
mysterious
connection
with
banking
then
mrs
carey
remembered
that
she
had
to
go
to
the
grocer
and
they
continued
their
way
when
the
shopping
was
done
they
often
went
down
a
side
street
of
little
houses
mostly
of
wood
in
which
fishermen
dwelt
and
here
and
there
a
fisherman
sat
on
his
doorstep
mending
his
nets
and
nets
hung
to
dry
upon
the
doors
till
they
came
to
a
small
beach
shut
in
on
each
side
by
warehouses
but
with
a
view
of
the
sea
mrs
carey
stood
for
a
few
minutes
and
looked
at
it
it
was
turbid
and
yellow
and
who
knows
what
thoughts
passed
through
her
mind
while
philip
searched
for
flat
stones
to
play
ducks
and
drakes
then
they
walked
slowly
back
they
looked
into
the
post
office
to
get
the
right
time
nodded
to
mrs
wigram
the
doctors
wife
who
sat
at
her
window
sewing
and
so
got
home
dinner
was
at
one
oclock
and
on
monday
tuesday
and
wednesday
it
consisted
of
beef
roast
hashed
and
minced
and
on
thursday
friday
and
saturday
of
mutton
on
sunday
they
ate
one
of
their
own
chickens
in
the
afternoon
philip
did
his
lessons
he
was
taught
latin
and
mathematics
by
his
uncle
who
knew
neither
and
french
and
the
piano
by
his
aunt
of
french
she
was
ignorant
but
she
knew
the
piano
well
enough
to
accompany
the
oldfashioned
songs
she
had
sung
for
thirty
years
uncle
william
used
to
tell
philip
that
when
he
was
a
curate
his
wife
had
known
twelve
songs
by
heart
which
she
could
sing
at
a
moments
notice
whenever
she
was
asked
she
often
sang
still
when
there
was
a
teaparty
at
the
vicarage
there
were
few
people
whom
the
careys
cared
to
ask
there
and
their
parties
consisted
always
of
the
curate
josiah
graves
with
his
sister
dr
wigram
and
his
wife
after
tea
miss
graves
played
one
or
two
of
mendelssohns
songs
without
words
and
mrs
carey
sang
when
the
swallows
homeward
fly
or
trot
trot
my
pony
but
the
careys
did
not
give
teaparties
often
the
preparations
upset
them
and
when
their
guests
were
gone
they
felt
themselves
exhausted
they
preferred
to
have
tea
by
themselves
and
after
tea
they
played
backgammon
mrs
carey
arranged
that
her
husband
should
win
because
he
did
not
like
losing
they
had
cold
supper
at
eight
it
was
a
scrappy
meal
because
mary
ann
resented
getting
anything
ready
after
tea
and
mrs
carey
helped
to
clear
away
mrs
carey
seldom
eatsic
more
than
bread
and
butter
with
a
little
stewed
fruit
to
follow
but
the
vicar
had
a
slice
of
cold
meat
immediately
after
supper
mrs
carey
rang
the
bell
for
prayers
and
then
philip
went
to
bed
he
rebelled
against
being
undressed
by
mary
ann
and
after
a
while
succeeded
in
establishing
his
right
to
dress
and
undress
himself
at
nine
oclock
mary
ann
brought
in
the
eggs
and
the
plate
mrs
carey
wrote
the
date
on
each
egg
and
put
the
number
down
in
a
book
she
then
took
the
platebasket
on
her
arm
and
went
upstairs
mr
carey
continued
to
read
one
of
his
old
books
but
as
the
clock
struck
ten
he
got
up
put
out
the
lamps
and
followed
his
wife
to
bed
when
philip
arrived
there
was
some
difficulty
in
deciding
on
which
evening
he
should
have
his
bath
it
was
never
easy
to
get
plenty
of
hot
water
since
the
kitchen
boiler
did
not
work
and
it
was
impossible
for
two
persons
to
have
a
bath
on
the
same
day
the
only
man
who
had
a
bathroom
in
blackstable
was
mr
wilson
and
it
was
thought
ostentatious
of
him
mary
ann
had
her
bath
in
the
kitchen
on
monday
night
because
she
liked
to
begin
the
week
clean
uncle
william
could
not
have
his
on
saturday
because
he
had
a
heavy
day
before
him
and
he
was
always
a
little
tired
after
a
bath
so
he
had
it
on
friday
mrs
carey
had
hers
on
thursday
for
the
same
reason
it
looked
as
though
saturday
were
naturally
indicated
for
philip
but
mary
ann
said
she
couldnt
keep
the
fire
up
on
saturday
night
what
with
all
the
cooking
on
sunday
having
to
make
pastry
and
she
didnt
know
what
all
she
did
not
feel
up
to
giving
the
boy
his
bath
on
saturday
night
and
it
was
quite
clear
that
he
could
not
bath
himself
mrs
carey
was
shy
about
bathing
a
boy
and
of
course
the
vicar
had
his
sermon
but
the
vicar
insisted
that
philip
should
be
clean
and
sweet
for
the
lords
day
mary
ann
said
she
would
rather
go
than
be
put
uponand
after
eighteen
years
she
didnt
expect
to
have
more
work
given
her
and
they
might
show
some
considerationand
philip
said
he
didnt
want
anyone
to
bath
him
but
could
very
well
bath
himself
this
settled
it
mary
ann
said
she
was
quite
sure
he
wouldnt
bath
himself
properly
and
rather
than
he
should
go
dirtyand
not
because
he
was
going
into
the
presence
of
the
lord
but
because
she
couldnt
abide
a
boy
who
wasnt
properly
washedshed
work
herself
to
the
bone
even
if
it
was
saturday
night
chapter
vii
sunday
was
a
day
crowded
with
incident
mr
carey
was
accustomed
to
say
that
he
was
the
only
man
in
his
parish
who
worked
seven
days
a
week
the
household
got
up
half
an
hour
earlier
than
usual
no
lying
abed
for
a
poor
parson
on
the
day
of
rest
mr
carey
remarked
as
mary
ann
knocked
at
the
door
punctually
at
eight
it
took
mrs
carey
longer
to
dress
and
she
got
down
to
breakfast
at
nine
a
little
breathless
only
just
before
her
husband
mr
careys
boots
stood
in
front
of
the
fire
to
warm
prayers
were
longer
than
usual
and
the
breakfast
more
substantial
after
breakfast
the
vicar
cut
thin
slices
of
bread
for
the
communion
and
philip
was
privileged
to
cut
off
the
crust
he
was
sent
to
the
study
to
fetch
a
marble
paperweight
with
which
mr
carey
pressed
the
bread
till
it
was
thin
and
pulpy
and
then
it
was
cut
into
small
squares
the
amount
was
regulated
by
the
weather
on
a
very
bad
day
few
people
came
to
church
and
on
a
very
fine
one
though
many
came
few
stayed
for
communion
there
were
most
when
it
was
dry
enough
to
make
the
walk
to
church
pleasant
but
not
so
fine
that
people
wanted
to
hurry
away
then
mrs
carey
brought
the
communion
plate
out
of
the
safe
which
stood
in
the
pantry
and
the
vicar
polished
it
with
a
chamois
leather
at
ten
the
fly
drove
up
and
mr
carey
got
into
his
boots
mrs
carey
took
several
minutes
to
put
on
her
bonnet
during
which
the
vicar
in
a
voluminous
cloak
stood
in
the
hall
with
just
such
an
expression
on
his
face
as
would
have
become
an
early
christian
about
to
be
led
into
the
arena
it
was
extraordinary
that
after
thirty
years
of
marriage
his
wife
could
not
be
ready
in
time
on
sunday
morning
at
last
she
came
in
black
satin
the
vicar
did
not
like
colours
in
a
clergymans
wife
at
any
time
but
on
sundays
he
was
determined
that
she
should
wear
black
now
and
then
in
conspiracy
with
miss
graves
she
ventured
a
white
feather
or
a
pink
rose
in
her
bonnet
but
the
vicar
insisted
that
it
should
disappear
he
said
he
would
not
go
to
church
with
the
scarlet
woman
mrs
carey
sighed
as
a
woman
but
obeyed
as
a
wife
they
were
about
to
step
into
the
carriage
when
the
vicar
remembered
that
no
one
had
given
him
his
egg
they
knew
that
he
must
have
an
egg
for
his
voice
there
were
two
women
in
the
house
and
no
one
had
the
least
regard
for
his
comfort
mrs
carey
scolded
mary
ann
and
mary
ann
answered
that
she
could
not
think
of
everything
she
hurried
away
to
fetch
an
egg
and
mrs
carey
beat
it
up
in
a
glass
of
sherry
the
vicar
swallowed
it
at
a
gulp
the
communion
plate
was
stowed
in
the
carriage
and
they
set
off
the
fly
came
from
the
red
lion
and
had
a
peculiar
smell
of
stale
straw
they
drove
with
both
windows
closed
so
that
the
vicar
should
not
catch
cold
the
sexton
was
waiting
at
the
porch
to
take
the
communion
plate
and
while
the
vicar
went
to
the
vestry
mrs
carey
and
philip
settled
themselves
in
the
vicarage
pew
mrs
carey
placed
in
front
of
her
the
sixpenny
bit
she
was
accustomed
to
put
in
the
plate
and
gave
philip
threepence
for
the
same
purpose
the
church
filled
up
gradually
and
the
service
began
philip
grew
bored
during
the
sermon
but
if
he
fidgetted
mrs
carey
put
a
gentle
hand
on
his
arm
and
looked
at
him
reproachfully
he
regained
interest
when
the
final
hymn
was
sung
and
mr
graves
passed
round
with
the
plate
when
everyone
had
gone
mrs
carey
went
into
miss
graves
pew
to
have
a
few
words
with
her
while
they
were
waiting
for
the
gentlemen
and
philip
went
to
the
vestry
his
uncle
the
curate
and
mr
graves
were
still
in
their
surplices
mr
carey
gave
him
the
remains
of
the
consecrated
bread
and
told
him
he
might
eat
it
he
had
been
accustomed
to
eat
it
himself
as
it
seemed
blasphemous
to
throw
it
away
but
philips
keen
appetite
relieved
him
from
the
duty
then
they
counted
the
money
it
consisted
of
pennies
sixpences
and
threepenny
bits
there
were
always
two
single
shillings
one
put
in
the
plate
by
the
vicar
and
the
other
by
mr
graves
and
sometimes
there
was
a
florin
mr
graves
told
the
vicar
who
had
given
this
it
was
always
a
stranger
to
blackstable
and
mr
carey
wondered
who
he
was
but
miss
graves
had
observed
the
rash
act
and
was
able
to
tell
mrs
carey
that
the
stranger
came
from
london
was
married
and
had
children
during
the
drive
home
mrs
carey
passed
the
information
on
and
the
vicar
made
up
his
mind
to
call
on
him
and
ask
for
a
subscription
to
the
additional
curates
society
mr
carey
asked
if
philip
had
behaved
properly
and
mrs
carey
remarked
that
mrs
wigram
had
a
new
mantle
mr
cox
was
not
in
church
and
somebody
thought
that
miss
phillips
was
engaged
when
they
reached
the
vicarage
they
all
felt
that
they
deserved
a
substantial
dinner
when
this
was
over
mrs
carey
went
to
her
room
to
rest
and
mr
carey
lay
down
on
the
sofa
in
the
drawingroom
for
forty
winks
they
had
tea
at
five
and
the
vicar
ate
an
egg
to
support
himself
for
evensong
mrs
carey
did
not
go
to
this
so
that
mary
ann
might
but
she
read
the
service
through
and
the
hymns
mr
carey
walked
to
church
in
the
evening
and
philip
limped
along
by
his
side
the
walk
through
the
darkness
along
the
country
road
strangely
impressed
him
and
the
church
with
all
its
lights
in
the
distance
coming
gradually
nearer
seemed
very
friendly
at
first
he
was
shy
with
his
uncle
but
little
by
little
grew
used
to
him
and
he
would
slip
his
hand
in
his
uncles
and
walk
more
easily
for
the
feeling
of
protection
they
had
supper
when
they
got
home
mr
careys
slippers
were
waiting
for
him
on
a
footstool
in
front
of
the
fire
and
by
their
side
philips
one
the
shoe
of
a
small
boy
the
other
misshapen
and
odd
he
was
dreadfully
tired
when
he
went
up
to
bed
and
he
did
not
resist
when
mary
ann
undressed
him
she
kissed
him
after
she
tucked
him
up
and
he
began
to
love
her
chapter
viii
philip
had
led
always
the
solitary
life
of
an
only
child
and
his
loneliness
at
the
vicarage
was
no
greater
than
it
had
been
when
his
mother
lived
he
made
friends
with
mary
ann
she
was
a
chubby
little
person
of
thirtyfive
the
daughter
of
a
fisherman
and
had
come
to
the
vicarage
at
eighteen
it
was
her
first
place
and
she
had
no
intention
of
leaving
it
but
she
held
a
possible
marriage
as
a
rod
over
the
timid
heads
of
her
master
and
mistress
her
father
and
mother
lived
in
a
little
house
off
harbour
street
and
she
went
to
see
them
on
her
evenings
out
her
stories
of
the
sea
touched
philips
imagination
and
the
narrow
alleys
round
the
harbour
grew
rich
with
the
romance
which
his
young
fancy
lent
them
one
evening
he
asked
whether
he
might
go
home
with
her
but
his
aunt
was
afraid
that
he
might
catch
something
and
his
uncle
said
that
evil
communications
corrupted
good
manners
he
disliked
the
fisher
folk
who
were
rough
uncouth
and
went
to
chapel
but
philip
was
more
comfortable
in
the
kitchen
than
in
the
diningroom
and
whenever
he
could
he
took
his
toys
and
played
there
his
aunt
was
not
sorry
she
did
not
like
disorder
and
though
she
recognised
that
boys
must
be
expected
to
be
untidy
she
preferred
that
he
should
make
a
mess
in
the
kitchen
if
he
fidgeted
his
uncle
was
apt
to
grow
restless
and
say
it
was
high
time
he
went
to
school
mrs
carey
thought
philip
very
young
for
this
and
her
heart
went
out
to
the
motherless
child
but
her
attempts
to
gain
his
affection
were
awkward
and
the
boy
feeling
shy
received
her
demonstrations
with
so
much
sullenness
that
she
was
mortified
sometimes
she
heard
his
shrill
voice
raised
in
laughter
in
the
kitchen
but
when
she
went
in
he
grew
suddenly
silent
and
he
flushed
darkly
when
mary
ann
explained
the
joke
mrs
carey
could
not
see
anything
amusing
in
what
she
heard
and
she
smiled
with
constraint
he
seems
happier
with
mary
ann
than
with
us
william
she
said
when
she
returned
to
her
sewing
one
can
see
hes
been
very
badly
brought
up
he
wants
licking
into
shape
on
the
second
sunday
after
philip
arrived
an
unlucky
incident
occurred
mr
carey
had
retired
as
usual
after
dinner
for
a
little
snooze
in
the
drawingroom
but
he
was
in
an
irritable
mood
and
could
not
sleep
josiah
graves
that
morning
had
objected
strongly
to
some
candlesticks
with
which
the
vicar
had
adorned
the
altar
he
had
bought
them
secondhand
in
tercanbury
and
he
thought
they
looked
very
well
but
josiah
graves
said
they
were
popish
this
was
a
taunt
that
always
aroused
the
vicar
he
had
been
at
oxford
during
the
movement
which
ended
in
the
secession
from
the
established
church
of
edward
manning
and
he
felt
a
certain
sympathy
for
the
church
of
rome
he
would
willingly
have
made
the
service
more
ornate
than
had
been
usual
in
the
lowchurch
parish
of
blackstable
and
in
his
secret
soul
he
yearned
for
processions
and
lighted
candles
he
drew
the
line
at
incense
he
hated
the
word
protestant
he
called
himself
a
catholic
he
was
accustomed
to
say
that
papists
required
an
epithet
they
were
roman
catholic
but
the
church
of
england
was
catholic
in
the
best
the
fullest
and
the
noblest
sense
of
the
term
he
was
pleased
to
think
that
his
shaven
face
gave
him
the
look
of
a
priest
and
in
his
youth
he
had
possessed
an
ascetic
air
which
added
to
the
impression
he
often
related
that
on
one
of
his
holidays
in
boulogne
one
of
those
holidays
upon
which
his
wife
for
economys
sake
did
not
accompany
him
when
he
was
sitting
in
a
church
the
cure
had
come
up
to
him
and
invited
him
to
preach
a
sermon
he
dismissed
his
curates
when
they
married
having
decided
views
on
the
celibacy
of
the
unbeneficed
clergy
but
when
at
an
election
the
liberals
had
written
on
his
garden
fence
in
large
blue
letters
this
way
to
rome
he
had
been
very
angry
and
threatened
to
prosecute
the
leaders
of
the
liberal
party
in
blackstable
he
made
up
his
mind
now
that
nothing
josiah
graves
said
would
induce
him
to
remove
the
candlesticks
from
the
altar
and
he
muttered
bismarck
to
himself
once
or
twice
irritably
suddenly
he
heard
an
unexpected
noise
he
pulled
the
handkerchief
off
his
face
got
up
from
the
sofa
on
which
he
was
lying
and
went
into
the
diningroom
philip
was
seated
on
the
table
with
all
his
bricks
around
him
he
had
built
a
monstrous
castle
and
some
defect
in
the
foundation
had
just
brought
the
structure
down
in
noisy
ruin
what
are
you
doing
with
those
bricks
philip
you
know
youre
not
allowed
to
play
games
on
sunday
philip
stared
at
him
for
a
moment
with
frightened
eyes
and
as
his
habit
was
flushed
deeply
i
always
used
to
play
at
home
he
answered
im
sure
your
dear
mamma
never
allowed
you
to
do
such
a
wicked
thing
as
that
philip
did
not
know
it
was
wicked
but
if
it
was
he
did
not
wish
it
to
be
supposed
that
his
mother
had
consented
to
it
he
hung
his
head
and
did
not
answer
dont
you
know
its
very
very
wicked
to
play
on
sundays
what
dyou
suppose
its
called
the
day
of
rest
for
youre
going
to
church
tonight
and
how
can
you
face
your
maker
when
youve
been
breaking
one
of
his
laws
in
the
afternoon
mr
carey
told
him
to
put
the
bricks
away
at
once
and
stood
over
him
while
philip
did
so
youre
a
very
naughty
boy
he
repeated
think
of
the
grief
youre
causing
your
poor
mother
in
heaven
philip
felt
inclined
to
cry
but
he
had
an
instinctive
disinclination
to
letting
other
people
see
his
tears
and
he
clenched
his
teeth
to
prevent
the
sobs
from
escaping
mr
carey
sat
down
in
his
armchair
and
began
to
turn
over
the
pages
of
a
book
philip
stood
at
the
window
the
vicarage
was
set
back
from
the
highroad
to
tercanbury
and
from
the
diningroom
one
saw
a
semicircular
strip
of
lawn
and
then
as
far
as
the
horizon
green
fields
sheep
were
grazing
in
them
the
sky
was
forlorn
and
gray
philip
felt
infinitely
unhappy
presently
mary
ann
came
in
to
lay
the
tea
and
aunt
louisa
descended
the
stairs
have
you
had
a
nice
little
nap
william
she
asked
no
he
answered
philip
made
so
much
noise
that
i
couldnt
sleep
a
wink
this
was
not
quite
accurate
for
he
had
been
kept
awake
by
his
own
thoughts
and
philip
listening
sullenly
reflected
that
he
had
only
made
a
noise
once
and
there
was
no
reason
why
his
uncle
should
not
have
slept
before
or
after
when
mrs
carey
asked
for
an
explanation
the
vicar
narrated
the
facts
he
hasnt
even
said
he
was
sorry
he
finished
oh
philip
im
sure
youre
sorry
said
mrs
carey
anxious
that
the
child
should
not
seem
wickeder
to
his
uncle
than
need
be
philip
did
not
reply
he
went
on
munching
his
bread
and
butter
he
did
not
know
what
power
it
was
in
him
that
prevented
him
from
making
any
expression
of
regret
he
felt
his
ears
tingling
he
was
a
little
inclined
to
cry
but
no
word
would
issue
from
his
lips
you
neednt
make
it
worse
by
sulking
said
mr
carey
tea
was
finished
in
silence
mrs
carey
looked
at
philip
surreptitiously
now
and
then
but
the
vicar
elaborately
ignored
him
when
philip
saw
his
uncle
go
upstairs
to
get
ready
for
church
he
went
into
the
hall
and
got
his
hat
and
coat
but
when
the
vicar
came
downstairs
and
saw
him
he
said
i
dont
wish
you
to
go
to
church
tonight
philip
i
dont
think
youre
in
a
proper
frame
of
mind
to
enter
the
house
of
god
philip
did
not
say
a
word
he
felt
it
was
a
deep
humiliation
that
was
placed
upon
him
and
his
cheeks
reddened
he
stood
silently
watching
his
uncle
put
on
his
broad
hat
and
his
voluminous
cloak
mrs
carey
as
usual
went
to
the
door
to
see
him
off
then
she
turned
to
philip
never
mind
philip
you
wont
be
a
naughty
boy
next
sunday
will
you
and
then
your
uncle
will
take
you
to
church
with
him
in
the
evening
she
took
off
his
hat
and
coat
and
led
him
into
the
diningroom
shall
you
and
i
read
the
service
together
philip
and
well
sing
the
hymns
at
the
harmonium
would
you
like
that
philip
shook
his
head
decidedly
mrs
carey
was
taken
aback
if
he
would
not
read
the
evening
service
with
her
she
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
him
then
what
would
you
like
to
do
until
your
uncle
comes
back
she
asked
helplessly
philip
broke
his
silence
at
last
i
want
to
be
left
alone
he
said
philip
how
can
you
say
anything
so
unkind
dont
you
know
that
your
uncle
and
i
only
want
your
good
dont
you
love
me
at
all
i
hate
you
i
wish
you
was
dead
mrs
carey
gasped
he
said
the
words
so
savagely
that
it
gave
her
quite
a
start
she
had
nothing
to
say
she
sat
down
in
her
husbands
chair
and
as
she
thought
of
her
desire
to
love
the
friendless
crippled
boy
and
her
eager
wish
that
he
should
love
hershe
was
a
barren
woman
and
even
though
it
was
clearly
gods
will
that
she
should
be
childless
she
could
scarcely
bear
to
look
at
little
children
sometimes
her
heart
ached
sothe
tears
rose
to
her
eyes
and
one
by
one
slowly
rolled
down
her
cheeks
philip
watched
her
in
amazement
she
took
out
her
handkerchief
and
now
she
cried
without
restraint
suddenly
philip
realised
that
she
was
crying
because
of
what
he
had
said
and
he
was
sorry
he
went
up
to
her
silently
and
kissed
her
it
was
the
first
kiss
he
had
ever
given
her
without
being
asked
and
the
poor
lady
so
small
in
her
black
satin
shrivelled
up
and
sallow
with
her
funny
corkscrew
curls
took
the
little
boy
on
her
lap
and
put
her
arms
around
him
and
wept
as
though
her
heart
would
break
but
her
tears
were
partly
tears
of
happiness
for
she
felt
that
the
strangeness
between
them
was
gone
she
loved
him
now
with
a
new
love
because
he
had
made
her
suffer
chapter
ix
on
the
following
sunday
when
the
vicar
was
making
his
preparations
to
go
into
the
drawingroom
for
his
napall
the
actions
of
his
life
were
conducted
with
ceremonyand
mrs
carey
was
about
to
go
upstairs
philip
asked
what
shall
i
do
if
im
not
allowed
to
play
cant
you
sit
still
for
once
and
be
quiet
i
cant
sit
still
till
teatime
mr
carey
looked
out
of
the
window
but
it
was
cold
and
raw
and
he
could
not
suggest
that
philip
should
go
into
the
garden
i
know
what
you
can
do
you
can
learn
by
heart
the
collect
for
the
day
he
took
the
prayerbook
which
was
used
for
prayers
from
the
harmonium
and
turned
the
pages
till
he
came
to
the
place
he
wanted
its
not
a
long
one
if
you
can
say
it
without
a
mistake
when
i
come
in
to
tea
you
shall
have
the
top
of
my
egg
mrs
carey
drew
up
philips
chair
to
the
diningroom
tablethey
had
bought
him
a
high
chair
by
nowand
placed
the
book
in
front
of
him
the
devil
finds
work
for
idle
hands
to
do
said
mr
carey
he
put
some
more
coals
on
the
fire
so
that
there
should
be
a
cheerful
blaze
when
he
came
in
to
tea
and
went
into
the
drawingroom
he
loosened
his
collar
arranged
the
cushions
and
settled
himself
comfortably
on
the
sofa
but
thinking
the
drawingroom
a
little
chilly
mrs
carey
brought
him
a
rug
from
the
hall
she
put
it
over
his
legs
and
tucked
it
round
his
feet
she
drew
the
blinds
so
that
the
light
should
not
offend
his
eyes
and
since
he
had
closed
them
already
went
out
of
the
room
on
tiptoe
the
vicar
was
at
peace
with
himself
today
and
in
ten
minutes
he
was
asleep
he
snored
softly
it
was
the
sixth
sunday
after
epiphany
and
the
collect
began
with
the
words
o
god
whose
blessed
son
was
manifested
that
he
might
destroy
the
works
of
the
devil
and
make
us
the
sons
of
god
and
heirs
of
eternal
life
philip
read
it
through
he
could
make
no
sense
of
it
he
began
saying
the
words
aloud
to
himself
but
many
of
them
were
unknown
to
him
and
the
construction
of
the
sentence
was
strange
he
could
not
get
more
than
two
lines
in
his
head
and
his
attention
was
constantly
wandering
there
were
fruit
trees
trained
on
the
walls
of
the
vicarage
and
a
long
twig
beat
now
and
then
against
the
windowpane
sheep
grazed
stolidly
in
the
field
beyond
the
garden
it
seemed
as
though
there
were
knots
inside
his
brain
then
panic
seized
him
that
he
would
not
know
the
words
by
teatime
and
he
kept
on
whispering
them
to
himself
quickly
he
did
not
try
to
understand
but
merely
to
get
them
parrotlike
into
his
memory
mrs
carey
could
not
sleep
that
afternoon
and
by
four
oclock
she
was
so
wide
awake
that
she
came
downstairs
she
thought
she
would
hear
philip
his
collect
so
that
he
should
make
no
mistakes
when
he
said
it
to
his
uncle
his
uncle
then
would
be
pleased
he
would
see
that
the
boys
heart
was
in
the
right
place
but
when
mrs
carey
came
to
the
diningroom
and
was
about
to
go
in
she
heard
a
sound
that
made
her
stop
suddenly
her
heart
gave
a
little
jump
she
turned
away
and
quietly
slipped
out
of
the
frontdoor
she
walked
round
the
house
till
she
came
to
the
diningroom
window
and
then
cautiously
looked
in
philip
was
still
sitting
on
the
chair
she
had
put
him
in
but
his
head
was
on
the
table
buried
in
his
arms
and
he
was
sobbing
desperately
she
saw
the
convulsive
movement
of
his
shoulders
mrs
carey
was
frightened
a
thing
that
had
always
struck
her
about
the
child
was
that
he
seemed
so
collected
she
had
never
seen
him
cry
and
now
she
realised
that
his
calmness
was
some
instinctive
shame
of
showing
his
fillings
he
hid
himself
to
weep
without
thinking
that
her
husband
disliked
being
wakened
suddenly
she
burst
into
the
drawingroom
william
william
she
said
the
boys
crying
as
though
his
heart
would
break
mr
carey
sat
up
and
disentangled
himself
from
the
rug
about
his
legs
whats
he
got
to
cry
about
i
dont
know
oh
william
we
cant
let
the
boy
be
unhappy
dyou
think
its
our
fault
if
wed
had
children
wed
have
known
what
to
do
mr
carey
looked
at
her
in
perplexity
he
felt
extraordinarily
helpless
he
cant
be
crying
because
i
gave
him
the
collect
to
learn
its
not
more
than
ten
lines
dont
you
think
i
might
take
him
some
picture
books
to
look
at
william
there
are
some
of
the
holy
land
there
couldnt
be
anything
wrong
in
that
very
well
i
dont
mind
mrs
carey
went
into
the
study
to
collect
books
was
mr
careys
only
passion
and
he
never
went
into
tercanbury
without
spending
an
hour
or
two
in
the
secondhand
shop
he
always
brought
back
four
or
five
musty
volumes
he
never
read
them
for
he
had
long
lost
the
habit
of
reading
but
he
liked
to
turn
the
pages
look
at
the
illustrations
if
they
were
illustrated
and
mend
the
bindings
he
welcomed
wet
days
because
on
them
he
could
stay
at
home
without
pangs
of
conscience
and
spend
the
afternoon
with
white
of
egg
and
a
gluepot
patching
up
the
russia
leather
of
some
battered
quarto
he
had
many
volumes
of
old
travels
with
steel
engravings
and
mrs
carey
quickly
found
two
which
described
palestine
she
coughed
elaborately
at
the
door
so
that
philip
should
have
time
to
compose
himself
she
felt
that
he
would
be
humiliated
if
she
came
upon
him
in
the
midst
of
his
tears
then
she
rattled
the
door
handle
when
she
went
in
philip
was
poring
over
the
prayerbook
hiding
his
eyes
with
his
hands
so
that
she
might
not
see
he
had
been
crying
do
you
know
the
collect
yet
she
said
he
did
not
answer
for
a
moment
and
she
felt
that
he
did
not
trust
his
voice
she
was
oddly
embarrassed
i
cant
learn
it
by
heart
he
said
at
last
with
a
gasp
oh
well
never
mind
she
said
you
neednt
ive
got
some
picture
books
for
you
to
look
at
come
and
sit
on
my
lap
and
well
look
at
them
together
philip
slipped
off
his
chair
and
limped
over
to
her
he
looked
down
so
that
she
should
not
see
his
eyes
she
put
her
arms
round
him
look
she
said
thats
the
place
where
our
blessed
lord
was
born
she
showed
him
an
eastern
town
with
flat
roofs
and
cupolas
and
minarets
in
the
foreground
was
a
group
of
palmtrees
and
under
them
were
resting
two
arabs
and
some
camels
philip
passed
his
hand
over
the
picture
as
if
he
wanted
to
feel
the
houses
and
the
loose
habiliments
of
the
nomads
read
what
it
says
he
asked
mrs
carey
in
her
even
voice
read
the
opposite
page
it
was
a
romantic
narrative
of
some
eastern
traveller
of
the
thirties
pompous
maybe
but
fragrant
with
the
emotion
with
which
the
east
came
to
the
generation
that
followed
byron
and
chateaubriand
in
a
moment
or
two
philip
interrupted
her
i
want
to
see
another
picture
when
mary
ann
came
in
and
mrs
carey
rose
to
help
her
lay
the
cloth
philip
took
the
book
in
his
hands
and
hurried
through
the
illustrations
it
was
with
difficulty
that
his
aunt
induced
him
to
put
the
book
down
for
tea
he
had
forgotten
his
horrible
struggle
to
get
the
collect
by
heart
he
had
forgotten
his
tears
next
day
it
was
raining
and
he
asked
for
the
book
again
mrs
carey
gave
it
him
joyfully
talking
over
his
future
with
her
husband
she
had
found
that
both
desired
him
to
take
orders
and
this
eagerness
for
the
book
which
described
places
hallowed
by
the
presence
of
jesus
seemed
a
good
sign
it
looked
as
though
the
boys
mind
addressed
itself
naturally
to
holy
things
but
in
a
day
or
two
he
asked
for
more
books
mr
carey
took
him
into
his
study
showed
him
the
shelf
in
which
he
kept
illustrated
works
and
chose
for
him
one
that
dealt
with
rome
philip
took
it
greedily
the
pictures
led
him
to
a
new
amusement
he
began
to
read
the
page
before
and
the
page
after
each
engraving
to
find
out
what
it
was
about
and
soon
he
lost
all
interest
in
his
toys
then
when
no
one
was
near
he
took
out
books
for
himself
and
perhaps
because
the
first
impression
on
his
mind
was
made
by
an
eastern
town
he
found
his
chief
amusement
in
those
which
described
the
levant
his
heart
beat
with
excitement
at
the
pictures
of
mosques
and
rich
palaces
but
there
was
one
in
a
book
on
constantinople
which
peculiarly
stirred
his
imagination
it
was
called
the
hall
of
the
thousand
columns
it
was
a
byzantine
cistern
which
the
popular
fancy
had
endowed
with
fantastic
vastness
and
the
legend
which
he
read
told
that
a
boat
was
always
moored
at
the
entrance
to
tempt
the
unwary
but
no
traveller
venturing
into
the
darkness
had
ever
been
seen
again
and
philip
wondered
whether
the
boat
went
on
for
ever
through
one
pillared
alley
after
another
or
came
at
last
to
some
strange
mansion
one
day
a
good
fortune
befell
him
for
he
hit
upon
lanes
translation
of
the
thousand
nights
and
a
night
he
was
captured
first
by
the
illustrations
and
then
he
began
to
read
to
start
with
the
stories
that
dealt
with
magic
and
then
the
others
and
those
he
liked
he
read
again
and
again
he
could
think
of
nothing
else
he
forgot
the
life
about
him
he
had
to
be
called
two
or
three
times
before
he
would
come
to
his
dinner
insensibly
he
formed
the
most
delightful
habit
in
the
world
the
habit
of
reading
he
did
not
know
that
thus
he
was
providing
himself
with
a
refuge
from
all
the
distress
of
life
he
did
not
know
either
that
he
was
creating
for
himself
an
unreal
world
which
would
make
the
real
world
of
every
day
a
source
of
bitter
disappointment
presently
he
began
to
read
other
things
his
brain
was
precocious
his
uncle
and
aunt
seeing
that
he
occupied
himself
and
neither
worried
nor
made
a
noise
ceased
to
trouble
themselves
about
him
mr
carey
had
so
many
books
that
he
did
not
know
them
and
as
he
read
little
he
forgot
the
odd
lots
he
had
bought
at
one
time
and
another
because
they
were
cheap
haphazard
among
the
sermons
and
homilies
the
travels
the
lives
of
the
saints
the
fathers
the
histories
of
the
church
were
oldfashioned
novels
and
these
philip
at
last
discovered
he
chose
them
by
their
titles
and
the
first
he
read
was
the
lancashire
witches
and
then
he
read
the
admirable
crichton
and
then
many
more
whenever
he
started
a
book
with
two
solitary
travellers
riding
along
the
brink
of
a
desperate
ravine
he
knew
he
was
safe
the
summer
was
come
now
and
the
gardener
an
old
sailor
made
him
a
hammock
and
fixed
it
up
for
him
in
the
branches
of
a
weeping
willow
and
here
for
long
hours
he
lay
hidden
from
anyone
who
might
come
to
the
vicarage
reading
reading
passionately
time
passed
and
it
was
july
august
came
on
sundays
the
church
was
crowded
with
strangers
and
the
collection
at
the
offertory
often
amounted
to
two
pounds
neither
the
vicar
nor
mrs
carey
went
out
of
the
garden
much
during
this
period
for
they
disliked
strange
faces
and
they
looked
upon
the
visitors
from
london
with
aversion
the
house
opposite
was
taken
for
six
weeks
by
a
gentleman
who
had
two
little
boys
and
he
sent
in
to
ask
if
philip
would
like
to
go
and
play
with
them
but
mrs
carey
returned
a
polite
refusal
she
was
afraid
that
philip
would
be
corrupted
by
little
boys
from
london
he
was
going
to
be
a
clergyman
and
it
was
necessary
that
he
should
be
preserved
from
contamination
she
liked
to
see
in
him
an
infant
samuel
chapter
x
the
careys
made
up
their
minds
to
send
philip
to
kings
school
at
tercanbury
the
neighbouring
clergy
sent
their
sons
there
it
was
united
by
long
tradition
to
the
cathedral
its
headmaster
was
an
honorary
canon
and
a
past
headmaster
was
the
archdeacon
boys
were
encouraged
there
to
aspire
to
holy
orders
and
the
education
was
such
as
might
prepare
an
honest
lad
to
spend
his
life
in
gods
service
a
preparatory
school
was
attached
to
it
and
to
this
it
was
arranged
that
philip
should
go
mr
carey
took
him
into
tercanbury
one
thursday
afternoon
towards
the
end
of
september
all
day
philip
had
been
excited
and
rather
frightened
he
knew
little
of
school
life
but
what
he
had
read
in
the
stories
of
the
boys
own
paper
he
had
also
read
eric
or
little
by
little
when
they
got
out
of
the
train
at
tercanbury
philip
felt
sick
with
apprehension
and
during
the
drive
in
to
the
town
sat
pale
and
silent
the
high
brick
wall
in
front
of
the
school
gave
it
the
look
of
a
prison
there
was
a
little
door
in
it
which
opened
on
their
ringing
and
a
clumsy
untidy
man
came
out
and
fetched
philips
tin
trunk
and
his
playbox
they
were
shown
into
the
drawingroom
it
was
filled
with
massive
ugly
furniture
and
the
chairs
of
the
suite
were
placed
round
the
walls
with
a
forbidding
rigidity
they
waited
for
the
headmaster
whats
mr
watson
like
asked
philip
after
a
while
youll
see
for
yourself
there
was
another
pause
mr
carey
wondered
why
the
headmaster
did
not
come
presently
philip
made
an
effort
and
spoke
again
tell
him
ive
got
a
clubfoot
he
said
before
mr
carey
could
speak
the
door
burst
open
and
mr
watson
swept
into
the
room
to
philip
he
seemed
gigantic
he
was
a
man
of
over
six
feet
high
and
broad
with
enormous
hands
and
a
great
red
beard
he
talked
loudly
in
a
jovial
manner
but
his
aggressive
cheerfulness
struck
terror
in
philips
heart
he
shook
hands
with
mr
carey
and
then
took
philips
small
hand
in
his
well
young
fellow
are
you
glad
to
come
to
school
he
shouted
philip
reddened
and
found
no
word
to
answer
how
old
are
you
nine
said
philip
you
must
say
sir
said
his
uncle
i
expect
youve
got
a
good
lot
to
learn
the
headmaster
bellowed
cheerily
to
give
the
boy
confidence
he
began
to
tickle
him
with
rough
fingers
philip
feeling
shy
and
uncomfortable
squirmed
under
his
touch
ive
put
him
in
the
small
dormitory
for
the
present
youll
like
that
wont
you
he
added
to
philip
only
eight
of
you
in
there
you
wont
feel
so
strange
then
the
door
opened
and
mrs
watson
came
in
she
was
a
dark
woman
with
black
hair
neatly
parted
in
the
middle
she
had
curiously
thick
lips
and
a
small
round
nose
her
eyes
were
large
and
black
there
was
a
singular
coldness
in
her
appearance
she
seldom
spoke
and
smiled
more
seldom
still
her
husband
introduced
mr
carey
to
her
and
then
gave
philip
a
friendly
push
towards
her
this
is
a
new
boy
helen
his
names
carey
without
a
word
she
shook
hands
with
philip
and
then
sat
down
not
speaking
while
the
headmaster
asked
mr
carey
how
much
philip
knew
and
what
books
he
had
been
working
with
the
vicar
of
blackstable
was
a
little
embarrassed
by
mr
watsons
boisterous
heartiness
and
in
a
moment
or
two
got
up
i
think
id
better
leave
philip
with
you
now
thats
all
right
said
mr
watson
hell

like
a
house
on
fire
wont
you
young
fellow
without
waiting
for
an
answer
from
philip
the
big
man
burst
into
a
great
bellow
of
laughter
mr
carey
kissed
philip
on
the
forehead
and
went
away
come
along
young
fellow
shouted
mr
watson
ill
show
you
the
schoolroom
he
swept
out
of
the
drawingroom
with
giant
strides
and
philip
hurriedly
limped
behind
him
he
was
taken
into
a
long
bare
room
with
two
tables
that
ran
along
its
whole
length
on
each
side
of
them
were
wooden
forms
nobody
much
here
yet
said
mr
watson
ill
just
show
you
the
playground
and
then
ill
leave
you
to
shift
for
yourself
mr
watson
led
the
way
philip
found
himself
in
a
large
playground
with
high
brick
walls
on
three
sides
of
it
on
the
fourth
side
was
an
iron
railing
through
which
you
saw
a
vast
lawn
and
beyond
this
some
of
the
buildings
of
kings
school
one
small
boy
was
wandering
disconsolately
kicking
up
the
gravel
as
he
walked
hulloa
venning
shouted
mr
watson
when
did
you
turn
up
the
small
boy
came
forward
and
shook
hands
heres
a
new
boy
hes
older
and
bigger
than
you
so
dont
you
bully
him
the
headmaster
glared
amicably
at
the
two
children
filling
them
with
fear
by
the
roar
of
his
voice
and
then
with
a
guffaw
left
them
whats
your
name
carey
whats
your
father
hes
dead
oh
does
your
mother
wash
my
mothers
dead
too
philip
thought
this
answer
would
cause
the
boy
a
certain
awkwardness
but
venning
was
not
to
be
turned
from
his
facetiousness
for
so
little
well
did
she
wash
he
went
on
yes
said
philip
indignantly
she
was
a
washerwoman
then
no
she
wasnt
then
she
didnt
wash
the
little
boy
crowed
with
delight
at
the
success
of
his
dialectic
then
he
caught
sight
of
philips
feet
whats
the
matter
with
your
foot
philip
instinctively
tried
to
withdraw
it
from
sight
he
hid
it
behind
the
one
which
was
whole
ive
got
a
clubfoot
he
answered
how
did
you
get
it
ive
always
had
it
lets
have
a
look
no
dont
then
the
little
boy
accompanied
the
words
with
a
sharp
kick
on
philips
shin
which
philip
did
not
expect
and
thus
could
not
guard
against
the
pain
was
so
great
that
it
made
him
gasp
but
greater
than
the
pain
was
the
surprise
he
did
not
know
why
venning
kicked
him
he
had
not
the
presence
of
mind
to
give
him
a
black
eye
besides
the
boy
was
smaller
than
he
and
he
had
read
in
the
boys
own
paper
that
it
was
a
mean
thing
to
hit
anyone
smaller
than
yourself
while
philip
was
nursing
his
shin
a
third
boy
appeared
and
his
tormentor
left
him
in
a
little
while
he
noticed
that
the
pair
were
talking
about
him
and
he
felt
they
were
looking
at
his
feet
he
grew
hot
and
uncomfortable
but
others
arrived
a
dozen
together
and
then
more
and
they
began
to
talk
about
their
doings
during
the
holidays
where
they
had
been
and
what
wonderful
cricket
they
had
played
a
few
new
boys
appeared
and
with
these
presently
philip
found
himself
talking
he
was
shy
and
nervous
he
was
anxious
to
make
himself
pleasant
but
he
could
not
think
of
anything
to
say
he
was
asked
a
great
many
questions
and
answered
them
all
quite
willingly
one
boy
asked
him
whether
he
could
play
cricket
no
answered
philip
ive
got
a
clubfoot
the
boy
looked
down
quickly
and
reddened
philip
saw
that
he
felt
he
had
asked
an
unseemly
question
he
was
too
shy
to
apologise
and
looked
at
philip
awkwardly
chapter
xi
next
morning
when
the
clanging
of
a
bell
awoke
philip
he
looked
round
his
cubicle
in
astonishment
then
a
voice
sang
out
and
he
remembered
where
he
was
are
you
awake
singer
the
partitions
of
the
cubicle
were
of
polished
pitchpine
and
there
was
a
green
curtain
in
front
in
those
days
there
was
little
thought
of
ventilation
and
the
windows
were
closed
except
when
the
dormitory
was
aired
in
the
morning
philip
got
up
and
knelt
down
to
say
his
prayers
it
was
a
cold
morning
and
he
shivered
a
little
but
he
had
been
taught
by
his
uncle
that
his
prayers
were
more
acceptable
to
god
if
he
said
them
in
his
nightshirt
than
if
he
waited
till
he
was
dressed
this
did
not
surprise
him
for
he
was
beginning
to
realise
that
he
was
the
creature
of
a
god
who
appreciated
the
discomfort
of
his
worshippers
then
he
washed
there
were
two
baths
for
the
fifty
boarders
and
each
boy
had
a
bath
once
a
week
the
rest
of
his
washing
was
done
in
a
small
basin
on
a
washstand
which
with
the
bed
and
a
chair
made
up
the
furniture
of
each
cubicle
the
boys
chatted
gaily
while
they
dressed
philip
was
all
ears
then
another
bell
sounded
and
they
ran
downstairs
they
took
their
seats
on
the
forms
on
each
side
of
the
two
long
tables
in
the
schoolroom
and
mr
watson
followed
by
his
wife
and
the
servants
came
in
and
sat
down
mr
watson
read
prayers
in
an
impressive
manner
and
the
supplications
thundered
out
in
his
loud
voice
as
though
they
were
threats
personally
addressed
to
each
boy
philip
listened
with
anxiety
then
mr
watson
read
a
chapter
from
the
bible
and
the
servants
trooped
out
in
a
moment
the
untidy
youth
brought
in
two
large
pots
of
tea
and
on
a
second
journey
immense
dishes
of
bread
and
butter
philip
had
a
squeamish
appetite
and
the
thick
slabs
of
poor
butter
on
the
bread
turned
his
stomach
but
he
saw
other
boys
scraping
it
off
and
followed
their
example
they
all
had
potted
meats
and
such
like
which
they
had
brought
in
their
playboxes
and
some
had
extras
eggs
or
bacon
upon
which
mr
watson
made
a
profit
when
he
had
asked
mr
carey
whether
philip
was
to
have
these
mr
carey
replied
that
he
did
not
think
boys
should
be
spoilt
mr
watson
quite
agreed
with
himhe
considered
nothing
was
better
than
bread
and
butter
for
growing
ladsbut
some
parents
unduly
pampering
their
offspring
insisted
on
it
philip
noticed
that
extras
gave
boys
a
certain
consideration
and
made
up
his
mind
when
he
wrote
to
aunt
louisa
to
ask
for
them
after
breakfast
the
boys
wandered
out
into
the
playground
here
the
dayboys
were
gradually
assembling
they
were
sons
of
the
local
clergy
of
the
officers
at
the
depot
and
of
such
manufacturers
or
men
of
business
as
the
old
town
possessed
presently
a
bell
rang
and
they
all
trooped
into
school
this
consisted
of
a
large
long
room
at
opposite
ends
of
which
two
undermasters
conducted
the
second
and
third
forms
and
of
a
smaller
one
leading
out
of
it
used
by
mr
watson
who
taught
the
first
form
to
attach
the
preparatory
to
the
senior
school
these
three
classes
were
known
officially
on
speech
days
and
in
reports
as
upper
middle
and
lower
second
philip
was
put
in
the
last
the
master
a
redfaced
man
with
a
pleasant
voice
was
called
rice
he
had
a
jolly
manner
with
boys
and
the
time
passed
quickly
philip
was
surprised
when
it
was
a
quarter
to
eleven
and
they
were
let
out
for
ten
minutes
rest
the
whole
school
rushed
noisily
into
the
playground
the
new
boys
were
told
to
go
into
the
middle
while
the
others
stationed
themselves
along
opposite
walls
they
began
to
play
pig
in
the
middle
the
old
boys
ran
from
wall
to
wall
while
the
new
boys
tried
to
catch
them
when
one
was
seized
and
the
mystic
words
saidone
two
three
and
a
pig
for
mehe
became
a
prisoner
and
turning
sides
helped
to
catch
those
who
were
still
free
philip
saw
a
boy
running
past
and
tried
to
catch
him
but
his
limp
gave
him
no
chance
and
the
runners
taking
their
opportunity
made
straight
for
the
ground
he
covered
then
one
of
them
had
the
brilliant
idea
of
imitating
philips
clumsy
run
other
boys
saw
it
and
began
to
laugh
then
they
all
copied
the
first
and
they
ran
round
philip
limping
grotesquely
screaming
in
their
treble
voices
with
shrill
laughter
they
lost
their
heads
with
the
delight
of
their
new
amusement
and
choked
with
helpless
merriment
one
of
them
tripped
philip
up
and
he
fell
heavily
as
he
always
fell
and
cut
his
knee
they
laughed
all
the
louder
when
he
got
up
a
boy
pushed
him
from
behind
and
he
would
have
fallen
again
if
another
had
not
caught
him
the
game
was
forgotten
in
the
entertainment
of
philips
deformity
one
of
them
invented
an
odd
rolling
limp
that
struck
the
rest
as
supremely
ridiculous
and
several
of
the
boys
lay
down
on
the
ground
and
rolled
about
in
laughter
philip
was
completely
scared
he
could
not
make
out
why
they
were
laughing
at
him
his
heart
beat
so
that
he
could
hardly
breathe
and
he
was
more
frightened
than
he
had
ever
been
in
his
life
he
stood
still
stupidly
while
the
boys
ran
round
him
mimicking
and
laughing
they
shouted
to
him
to
try
and
catch
them
but
he
did
not
move
he
did
not
want
them
to
see
him
run
any
more
he
was
using
all
his
strength
to
prevent
himself
from
crying
suddenly
the
bell
rang
and
they
all
trooped
back
to
school
philips
knee
was
bleeding
and
he
was
dusty
and
dishevelled
for
some
minutes
mr
rice
could
not
control
his
form
they
were
excited
still
by
the
strange
novelty
and
philip
saw
one
or
two
of
them
furtively
looking
down
at
his
feet
he
tucked
them
under
the
bench
in
the
afternoon
they
went
up
to
play
football
but
mr
watson
stopped
philip
on
the
way
out
after
dinner
i
suppose
you
cant
play
football
carey
he
asked
him
philip
blushed
selfconsciously
no
sir
very
well
youd
better
go
up
to
the
field
you
can
walk
as
far
as
that
cant
you

philip
had
no
idea
where
the
field
was
but
he
answered
all
the
same
yes
sir
the
boys
went
in
charge
of
mr
rice
who
glanced
at
philip
and
seeing
he
had
not
changed
asked
why
he
was
not
going
to
play
mr
watson
said
i
neednt
sir
said
philip
why
there
were
boys
all
round
him
looking
at
him
curiously
and
a
feeling
of
shame
came
over
philip
he
looked
down
without
answering
others
gave
the
reply
hes
got
a
clubfoot
sir
oh
i
see
mr
rice
was
quite
young
he
had
only
taken
his
degree
a
year
before
and
he
was
suddenly
embarrassed
his
instinct
was
to
beg
the
boys
pardon
but
he
was
too
shy
to
do
so
he
made
his
voice
gruff
and
loud
now
then
you
boys
what
are
you
waiting
about
for
get
on
with
you
some
of
them
had
already
started
and
those
that
were
left
now
set
off
in
groups
of
two
or
three
youd
better
come
along
with
me
carey
said
the
master
you
dont
know
the
way
do
you
philip
guessed
the
kindness
and
a
sob
came
to
his
throat
i
cant
go
very
fast
sir
then
ill
go
very
slow
said
the
master
with
a
smile
philips
heart
went
out
to
the
redfaced
commonplace
young
man
who
said
a
gentle
word
to
him
he
suddenly
felt
less
unhappy
but
at
night
when
they
went
up
to
bed
and
were
undressing
the
boy
who
was
called
singer
came
out
of
his
cubicle
and
put
his
head
in
philips
i
say
lets
look
at
your
foot
he
said
no
answered
philip
he
jumped
into
bed
quickly
dont
say
no
to
me
said
singer
come
on
mason
the
boy
in
the
next
cubicle
was
looking
round
the
corner
and
at
the
words
he
slipped
in
they
made
for
philip
and
tried
to
tear
the
bedclothes
off
him
but
he
held
them
tightly
why
cant
you
leave
me
alone
he
cried
singer
seized
a
brush
and
with
the
back
of
it
beat
philips
hands
clenched
on
the
blanket
philip
cried
out
why
dont
you
show
us
your
foot
quietly
i
wont
in
desperation
philip
clenched
his
fist
and
hit
the
boy
who
tormented
him
but
he
was
at
a
disadvantage
and
the
boy
seized
his
arm
he
began
to
turn
it
oh
dont
dont
said
philip
youll
break
my
arm
stop
still
then
and
put
out
your
foot
philip
gave
a
sob
and
a
gasp
the
boy
gave
the
arm
another
wrench
the
pain
was
unendurable
all
right
ill
do
it
said
philip
he
put
out
his
foot
singer
still
kept
his
hand
on
philips
wrist
he
looked
curiously
at
the
deformity
isnt
it
beastly
said
mason
another
came
in
and
looked
too
ugh
he
said
in
disgust
my
word
it
is
rum
said
singer
making
a
face
is
it
hard
he
touched
it
with
the
tip
of
his
forefinger
cautiously
as
though
it
were
something
that
had
a
life
of
its
own
suddenly
they
heard
mr
watsons
heavy
tread
on
the
stairs
they
threw
the
clothes
back
on
philip
and
dashed
like
rabbits
into
their
cubicles
mr
watson
came
into
the
dormitory
raising
himself
on
tiptoe
he
could
see
over
the
rod
that
bore
the
green
curtain
and
he
looked
into
two
or
three
of
the
cubicles
the
little
boys
were
safely
in
bed
he
put
out
the
light
and
went
out
singer
called
out
to
philip
but
he
did
not
answer
he
had
got
his
teeth
in
the
pillow
so
that
his
sobbing
should
be
inaudible
he
was
not
crying
for
the
pain
they
had
caused
him
nor
for
the
humiliation
he
had
suffered
when
they
looked
at
his
foot
but
with
rage
at
himself
because
unable
to
stand
the
torture
he
had
put
out
his
foot
of
his
own
accord
and
then
he
felt
the
misery
of
his
life
it
seemed
to
his
childish
mind
that
this
unhappiness
must
go
on
for
ever
for
no
particular
reason
he
remembered
that
cold
morning
when
emma
had
taken
him
out
of
bed
and
put
him
beside
his
mother
he
had
not
thought
of
it
once
since
it
happened
but
now
he
seemed
to
feel
the
warmth
of
his
mothers
body
against
his
and
her
arms
around
him
suddenly
it
seemed
to
him
that
his
life
was
a
dream
his
mothers
death
and
the
life
at
the
vicarage
and
these
two
wretched
days
at
school
and
he
would
awake
in
the
morning
and
be
back
again
at
home
his
tears
dried
as
he
thought
of
it
he
was
too
unhappy
it
must
be
nothing
but
a
dream
and
his
mother
was
alive
and
emma
would
come
up
presently
and
go
to
bed
he
fell
asleep
but
when
he
awoke
next
morning
it
was
to
the
clanging
of
a
bell
and
the
first
thing
his
eyes
saw
was
the
green
curtain
of
his
cubicle
chapter
xii
as
time
went
on
philips
deformity
ceased
to
interest
it
was
accepted
like
one
boys
red
hair
and
anothers
unreasonable
corpulence
but
meanwhile
he
had
grown
horribly
sensitive
he
never
ran
if
he
could
help
it
because
he
knew
it
made
his
limp
more
conspicuous
and
he
adopted
a
peculiar
walk
he
stood
still
as
much
as
he
could
with
his
clubfoot
behind
the
other
so
that
it
should
not
attract
notice
and
he
was
constantly
on
the
look
out
for
any
reference
to
it
because
he
could
not
join
in
the
games
which
other
boys
played
their
life
remained
strange
to
him
he
only
interested
himself
from
the
outside
in
their
doings
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
there
was
a
barrier
between
them
and
him
sometimes
they
seemed
to
think
that
it
was
his
fault
if
he
could
not
play
football
and
he
was
unable
to
make
them
understand
he
was
left
a
good
deal
to
himself
he
had
been
inclined
to
talkativeness
but
gradually
he
became
silent
he
began
to
think
of
the
difference
between
himself
and
others
the
biggest
boy
in
his
dormitory
singer
took
a
dislike
to
him
and
philip
small
for
his
age
had
to
put
up
with
a
good
deal
of
hard
treatment
about
halfway
through
the
term
a
mania
ran
through
the
school
for
a
game
called
nibs
it
was
a
game
for
two
played
on
a
table
or
a
form
with
steel
pens
you
had
to
push
your
nib
with
the
fingernail
so
as
to
get
the
point
of
it
over
your
opponents
while
he
manoeuvred
to
prevent
this
and
to
get
the
point
of
his
nib
over
the
back
of
yours
when
this
result
was
achieved
you
breathed
on
the
ball
of
your
thumb
pressed
it
hard
on
the
two
nibs
and
if
you
were
able
then
to
lift
them
without
dropping
either
both
nibs
became
yours
soon
nothing
was
seen
but
boys
playing
this
game
and
the
more
skilful
acquired
vast
stores
of
nibs
but
in
a
little
while
mr
watson
made
up
his
mind
that
it
was
a
form
of
gambling
forbade
the
game
and
confiscated
all
the
nibs
in
the
boys
possession
philip
had
been
very
adroit
and
it
was
with
a
heavy
heart
that
he
gave
up
his
winning
but
his
fingers
itched
to
play
still
and
a
few
days
later
on
his
way
to
the
football
field
he
went
into
a
shop
and
bought
a
pennyworth
of
j
pens
he
carried
them
loose
in
his
pocket
and
enjoyed
feeling
them
presently
singer
found
out
that
he
had
them
singer
had
given
up
his
nibs
too
but
he
had
kept
back
a
very
large
one
called
a
jumbo
which
was
almost
unconquerable
and
he
could
not
resist
the
opportunity
of
getting
philips
js
out
of
him
though
philip
knew
that
he
was
at
a
disadvantage
with
his
small
nibs
he
had
an
adventurous
disposition
and
was
willing
to
take
the
risk
besides
he
was
aware
that
singer
would
not
allow
him
to
refuse
he
had
not
played
for
a
week
and
sat
down
to
the
game
now
with
a
thrill
of
excitement
he
lost
two
of
his
small
nibs
quickly
and
singer
was
jubilant
but
the
third
time
by
some
chance
the
jumbo
slipped
round
and
philip
was
able
to
push
his
j
across
it
he
crowed
with
triumph
at
that
moment
mr
watson
came
in
what
are
you
doing
he
asked
he
looked
from
singer
to
philip
but
neither
answered
dont
you
know
that
ive
forbidden
you
to
play
that
idiotic
game
philips
heart
beat
fast
he
knew
what
was
coming
and
was
dreadfully
frightened
but
in
his
fright
there
was
a
certain
exultation
he
had
never
been
swished
of
course
it
would
hurt
but
it
was
something
to
boast
about
afterwards
come
into
my
study
the
headmaster
turned
and
they
followed
him
side
by
side
singer
whispered
to
philip
were
in
for
it
mr
watson
pointed
to
singer
bend
over
he
said
philip
very
white
saw
the
boy
quiver
at
each
stroke
and
after
the
third
he
heard
him
cry
out
three
more
followed
thatll
do
get
up
singer
stood
up
the
tears
were
streaming
down
his
face
philip
stepped
forward
mr
watson
looked
at
him
for
a
moment
im
not
going
to
cane
you
youre
a
new
boy
and
i
cant
hit
a
cripple
go
away
both
of
you
and
dont
be
naughty
again
when
they
got
back
into
the
schoolroom
a
group
of
boys
who
had
learned
in
some
mysterious
way
what
was
happening
were
waiting
for
them
they
set
upon
singer
at
once
with
eager
questions
singer
faced
them
his
face
red
with
the
pain
and
marks
of
tears
still
on
his
cheeks
he
pointed
with
his
head
at
philip
who
was
standing
a
little
behind
him
he
got
off
because
hes
a
cripple
he
said
angrily
philip
stood
silent
and
flushed
he
felt
that
they
looked
at
him
with
contempt
how
many
did
you
get
one
boy
asked
singer
but
he
did
not
answer
he
was
angry
because
he
had
been
hurt
dont
ask
me
to
play
nibs
with
you
again
he
said
to
philip
its
jolly
nice
for
you
you
dont
risk
anything
i
didnt
ask
you
didnt
you
he
quickly
put
out
his
foot
and
tripped
philip
up
philip
was
always
rather
unsteady
on
his
feet
and
he
fell
heavily
to
the
ground
cripple
said
singer
for
the
rest
of
the
term
he
tormented
philip
cruelly
and
though
philip
tried
to
keep
out
of
his
way
the
school
was
so
small
that
it
was
impossible
he
tried
being
friendly
and
jolly
with
him
he
abased
himself
so
far
as
to
buy
him
a
knife
but
though
singer
took
the
knife
he
was
not
placated
once
or
twice
driven
beyond
endurance
he
hit
and
kicked
the
bigger
boy
but
singer
was
so
much
stronger
that
philip
was
helpless
and
he
was
always
forced
after
more
or
less
torture
to
beg
his
pardon
it
was
that
which
rankled
with
philip
he
could
not
bear
the
humiliation
of
apologies
which
were
wrung
from
him
by
pain
greater
than
he
could
bear
and
what
made
it
worse
was
that
there
seemed
no
end
to
his
wretchedness
singer
was
only
eleven
and
would
not
go
to
the
upper
school
till
he
was
thirteen
philip
realised
that
he
must
live
two
years
with
a
tormentor
from
whom
there
was
no
escape
he
was
only
happy
while
he
was
working
and
when
he
got
into
bed
and
often
there
recurred
to
him
then
that
queer
feeling
that
his
life
with
all
its
misery
was
nothing
but
a
dream
and
that
he
would
awake
in
the
morning
in
his
own
little
bed
in
london
chapter
xiii
two
years
passed
and
philip
was
nearly
twelve
he
was
in
the
first
form
within
two
or
three
places
of
the
top
and
after
christmas
when
several
boys
would
be
leaving
for
the
senior
school
he
would
be
head
boy
he
had
already
quite
a
collection
of
prizes
worthless
books
on
bad
paper
but
in
gorgeous
bindings
decorated
with
the
arms
of
the
school
his
position
had
freed
him
from
bullying
and
he
was
not
unhappy
his
fellows
forgave
him
his
success
because
of
his
deformity
after
all
its
jolly
easy
for
him
to
get
prizes
they
said
theres
nothing
he
can
do
but
swat
he
had
lost
his
early
terror
of
mr
watson
he
had
grown
used
to
the
loud
voice
and
when
the
headmasters
heavy
hand
was
laid
on
his
shoulder
philip
discerned
vaguely
the
intention
of
a
caress
he
had
the
good
memory
which
is
more
useful
for
scholastic
achievements
than
mental
power
and
he
knew
mr
watson
expected
him
to
leave
the
preparatory
school
with
a
scholarship
but
he
had
grown
very
selfconscious
the
newborn
child
does
not
realise
that
his
body
is
more
a
part
of
himself
than
surrounding
objects
and
will
play
with
his
toes
without
any
feeling
that
they
belong
to
him
more
than
the
rattle
by
his
side
and
it
is
only
by
degrees
through
pain
that
he
understands
the
fact
of
the
body
and
experiences
of
the
same
kind
are
necessary
for
the
individual
to
become
conscious
of
himself
but
here
there
is
the
difference
that
although
everyone
becomes
equally
conscious
of
his
body
as
a
separate
and
complete
organism
everyone
does
not
become
equally
conscious
of
himself
as
a
complete
and
separate
personality
the
feeling
of
apartness
from
others
comes
to
most
with
puberty
but
it
is
not
always
developed
to
such
a
degree
as
to
make
the
difference
between
the
individual
and
his
fellows
noticeable
to
the
individual
it
is
such
as
he
as
little
conscious
of
himself
as
the
bee
in
a
hive
who
are
the
lucky
in
life
for
they
have
the
best
chance
of
happiness
their
activities
are
shared
by
all
and
their
pleasures
are
only
pleasures
because
they
are
enjoyed
in
common
you
will
see
them
on
whitmonday
dancing
on
hampstead
heath
shouting
at
a
football
match
or
from
club
windows
in
pall
mall
cheering
a
royal
procession
it
is
because
of
them
that
man
has
been
called
a
social
animal
philip
passed
from
the
innocence
of
childhood
to
bitter
consciousness
of
himself
by
the
ridicule
which
his
clubfoot
had
excited
the
circumstances
of
his
case
were
so
peculiar
that
he
could
not
apply
to
them
the
readymade
rules
which
acted
well
enough
in
ordinary
affairs
and
he
was
forced
to
think
for
himself
the
many
books
he
had
read
filled
his
mind
with
ideas
which
because
he
only
half
understood
them
gave
more
scope
to
his
imagination
beneath
his
painful
shyness
something
was
growing
up
within
him
and
obscurely
he
realised
his
personality
but
at
times
it
gave
him
odd
surprises
he
did
things
he
knew
not
why
and
afterwards
when
he
thought
of
them
found
himself
all
at
sea
there
was
a
boy
called
luard
between
whom
and
philip
a
friendship
had
arisen
and
one
day
when
they
were
playing
together
in
the
schoolroom
luard
began
to
perform
some
trick
with
an
ebony
penholder
of
philips
dont
play
the
giddy
ox
said
philip
youll
only
break
it
i
shant
but
no
sooner
were
the
words
out
of
the
boys
mouth
than
the
penholder
snapped
in
two
luard
looked
at
philip
with
dismay
oh
i
say
im
awfully
sorry
the
tears
rolled
down
philips
cheeks
but
he
did
not
answer
i
say
whats
the
matter
said
luard
with
surprise
ill
get
you
another
one
exactly
the
same
its
not
about
the
penholder
i
care
said
philip
in
a
trembling
voice
only
it
was
given
me
by
my
mater
just
before
she
died
i
say
im
awfully
sorry
carey
it
doesnt
matter
it
wasnt
your
fault
philip
took
the
two
pieces
of
the
penholder
and
looked
at
them
he
tried
to
restrain
his
sobs
he
felt
utterly
miserable
and
yet
he
could
not
tell
why
for
he
knew
quite
well
that
he
had
bought
the
penholder
during
his
last
holidays
at
blackstable
for
one
and
twopence
he
did
not
know
in
the
least
what
had
made
him
invent
that
pathetic
story
but
he
was
quite
as
unhappy
as
though
it
had
been
true
the
pious
atmosphere
of
the
vicarage
and
the
religious
tone
of
the
school
had
made
philips
conscience
very
sensitive
he
absorbed
insensibly
the
feeling
about
him
that
the
tempter
was
ever
on
the
watch
to
gain
his
immortal
soul
and
though
he
was
not
more
truthful
than
most
boys
he
never
told
a
lie
without
suffering
from
remorse
when
he
thought
over
this
incident
he
was
very
much
distressed
and
made
up
his
mind
that
he
must
go
to
luard
and
tell
him
that
the
story
was
an
invention
though
he
dreaded
humiliation
more
than
anything
in
the
world
he
hugged
himself
for
two
or
three
days
at
the
thought
of
the
agonising
joy
of
humiliating
himself
to
the
glory
of
god
but
he
never
got
any
further
he
satisfied
his
conscience
by
the
more
comfortable
method
of
expressing
his
repentance
only
to
the
almighty
but
he
could
not
understand
why
he
should
have
been
so
genuinely
affected
by
the
story
he
was
making
up
the
tears
that
flowed
down
his
grubby
cheeks
were
real
tears
then
by
some
accident
of
association
there
occurred
to
him
that
scene
when
emma
had
told
him
of
his
mothers
death
and
though
he
could
not
speak
for
crying
he
had
insisted
on
going
in
to
say
goodbye
to
the
misses
watkin
so
that
they
might
see
his
grief
and
pity
him
chapter
xiv
then
a
wave
of
religiosity
passed
through
the
school
bad
language
was
no
longer
heard
and
the
little
nastinesses
of
small
boys
were
looked
upon
with
hostility
the
bigger
boys
like
the
lords
temporal
of
the
middle
ages
used
the
strength
of
their
arms
to
persuade
those
weaker
than
themselves
to
virtuous
courses
philip
his
restless
mind
avid
for
new
things
became
very
devout
he
heard
soon
that
it
was
possible
to
join
a
bible
league
and
wrote
to
london
for
particulars
these
consisted
in
a
form
to
be
filled
up
with
the
applicants
name
age
and
school
a
solemn
declaration
to
be
signed
that
he
would
read
a
set
portion
of
holy
scripture
every
night
for
a
year
and
a
request
for
half
a
crown
this
it
was
explained
was
demanded
partly
to
prove
the
earnestness
of
the
applicants
desire
to
become
a
member
of
the
league
and
partly
to
cover
clerical
expenses
philip
duly
sent
the
papers
and
the
money
and
in
return
received
a
calendar
worth
about
a
penny
on
which
was
set
down
the
appointed
passage
to
be
read
each
day
and
a
sheet
of
paper
on
one
side
of
which
was
a
picture
of
the
good
shepherd
and
a
lamb
and
on
the
other
decoratively
framed
in
red
lines
a
short
prayer
which
had
to
be
said
before
beginning
to
read
every
evening
he
undressed
as
quickly
as
possible
in
order
to
have
time
for
his
task
before
the
gas
was
put
out
he
read
industriously
as
he
read
always
without
criticism
stories
of
cruelty
deceit
ingratitude
dishonesty
and
low
cunning
actions
which
would
have
excited
his
horror
in
the
life
about
him
in
the
reading
passed
through
his
mind
without
comment
because
they
were
committed
under
the
direct
inspiration
of
god
the
method
of
the
league
was
to
alternate
a
book
of
the
old
testament
with
a
book
of
the
new
and
one
night
philip
came
across
these
words
of
jesus
christ
if
ye
have
faith
and
doubt
not
ye
shall
not
only
do
this
which
is
done
to
the
figtree
but
also
if
ye
shall
say
unto
this
mountain
be
thou
removed
and
be
thou
cast
into
the
sea
it
shall
be
done
and
all
this
whatsoever
ye
shall
ask
in
prayer
believing
ye
shall
receive
they
made
no
particular
impression
on
him
but
it
happened
that
two
or
three
days
later
being
sunday
the
canon
in
residence
chose
them
for
the
text
of
his
sermon
even
if
philip
had
wanted
to
hear
this
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
the
boys
of
kings
school
sit
in
the
choir
and
the
pulpit
stands
at
the
corner
of
the
transept
so
that
the
preachers
back
is
almost
turned
to
them
the
distance
also
is
so
great
that
it
needs
a
man
with
a
fine
voice
and
a
knowledge
of
elocution
to
make
himself
heard
in
the
choir
and
according
to
long
usage
the
canons
of
tercanbury
are
chosen
for
their
learning
rather
than
for
any
qualities
which
might
be
of
use
in
a
cathedral
church
but
the
words
of
the
text
perhaps
because
he
had
read
them
so
short
a
while
before
came
clearly
enough
to
philips
ears
and
they
seemed
on
a
sudden
to
have
a
personal
application
he
thought
about
them
through
most
of
the
sermon
and
that
night
on
getting
into
bed
he
turned
over
the
pages
of
the
gospel
and
found
once
more
the
passage
though
he
believed
implicitly
everything
he
saw
in
print
he
had
learned
already
that
in
the
bible
things
that
said
one
thing
quite
clearly
often
mysteriously
meant
another
there
was
no
one
he
liked
to
ask
at
school
so
he
kept
the
question
he
had
in
mind
till
the
christmas
holidays
and
then
one
day
he
made
an
opportunity
it
was
after
supper
and
prayers
were
just
finished
mrs
carey
was
counting
the
eggs
that
mary
ann
had
brought
in
as
usual
and
writing
on
each
one
the
date
philip
stood
at
the
table
and
pretended
to
turn
listlessly
the
pages
of
the
bible
i
say
uncle
william
this
passage
here
does
it
really
mean
that
he
put
his
finger
against
it
as
though
he
had
come
across
it
accidentally
mr
carey
looked
up
over
his
spectacles
he
was
holding
the
blackstable
times
in
front
of
the
fire
it
had
come
in
that
evening
damp
from
the
press
and
the
vicar
always
aired
it
for
ten
minutes
before
he
began
to
read
what
passage
is
that
he
asked
why
this
about
if
you
have
faith
you
can
remove
mountains
if
it
says
so
in
the
bible
it
is
so
philip
said
mrs
carey
gently
taking
up
the
platebasket
philip
looked
at
his
uncle
for
an
answer
its
a
matter
of
faith
dyou
mean
to
say
that
if
you
really
believed
you
could
move
mountains
you
could
by
the
grace
of
god
said
the
vicar
now
say
goodnight
to
your
uncle
philip
said
aunt
louisa
youre
not
wanting
to
move
a
mountain
tonight
are
you
philip
allowed
himself
to
be
kissed
on
the
forehead
by
his
uncle
and
preceded
mrs
carey
upstairs
he
had
got
the
information
he
wanted
his
little
room
was
icy
and
he
shivered
when
he
put
on
his
nightshirt
but
he
always
felt
that
his
prayers
were
more
pleasing
to
god
when
he
said
them
under
conditions
of
discomfort
the
coldness
of
his
hands
and
feet
were
an
offering
to
the
almighty
and
tonight
he
sank
on
his
knees
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
and
prayed
to
god
with
all
his
might
that
he
would
make
his
clubfoot
whole
it
was
a
very
small
thing
beside
the
moving
of
mountains
he
knew
that
god
could
do
it
if
he
wished
and
his
own
faith
was
complete
next
morning
finishing
his
prayers
with
the
same
request
he
fixed
a
date
for
the
miracle
oh
god
in
thy
loving
mercy
and
goodness
if
it
be
thy
will
please
make
my
foot
all
right
on
the
night
before
i
go
back
to
school
he
was
glad
to
get
his
petition
into
a
formula
and
he
repeated
it
later
in
the
diningroom
during
the
short
pause
which
the
vicar
always
made
after
prayers
before
he
rose
from
his
knees
he
said
it
again
in
the
evening
and
again
shivering
in
his
nightshirt
before
he
got
into
bed
and
he
believed
for
once
he
looked
forward
with
eagerness
to
the
end
of
the
holidays
he
laughed
to
himself
as
he
thought
of
his
uncles
astonishment
when
he
ran
down
the
stairs
three
at
a
time
and
after
breakfast
he
and
aunt
louisa
would
have
to
hurry
out
and
buy
a
new
pair
of
boots
at
school
they
would
be
astounded
hulloa
carey
what
have
you
done
with
your
foot
oh
its
all
right
now
he
would
answer
casually
as
though
it
were
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
he
would
be
able
to
play
football
his
heart
leaped
as
he
saw
himself
running
running
faster
than
any
of
the
other
boys
at
the
end
of
the
easter
term
there
were
the
sports
and
he
would
be
able
to
go
in
for
the
races
he
rather
fancied
himself
over
the
hurdles
it
would
be
splendid
to
be
like
everyone
else
not
to
be
stared
at
curiously
by
new
boys
who
did
not
know
about
his
deformity
nor
at
the
baths
in
summer
to
need
incredible
precautions
while
he
was
undressing
before
he
could
hide
his
foot
in
the
water
he
prayed
with
all
the
power
of
his
soul
no
doubts
assailed
him
he
was
confident
in
the
word
of
god
and
the
night
before
he
was
to
go
back
to
school
he
went
up
to
bed
tremulous
with
excitement
there
was
snow
on
the
ground
and
aunt
louisa
had
allowed
herself
the
unaccustomed
luxury
of
a
fire
in
her
bedroom
but
in
philips
little
room
it
was
so
cold
that
his
fingers
were
numb
and
he
had
great
difficulty
in
undoing
his
collar
his
teeth
chattered
the
idea
came
to
him
that
he
must
do
something
more
than
usual
to
attract
the
attention
of
god
and
he
turned
back
the
rug
which
was
in
front
of
his
bed
so
that
he
could
kneel
on
the
bare
boards
and
then
it
struck
him
that
his
nightshirt
was
a
softness
that
might
displease
his
maker
so
he
took
it
off
and
said
his
prayers
naked
when
he
got
into
bed
he
was
so
cold
that
for
some
time
he
could
not
sleep
but
when
he
did
it
was
so
soundly
that
mary
ann
had
to
shake
him
when
she
brought
in
his
hot
water
next
morning
she
talked
to
him
while
she
drew
the
curtains
but
he
did
not
answer
he
had
remembered
at
once
that
this
was
the
morning
for
the
miracle
his
heart
was
filled
with
joy
and
gratitude
his
first
instinct
was
to
put
down
his
hand
and
feel
the
foot
which
was
whole
now
but
to
do
this
seemed
to
doubt
the
goodness
of
god
he
knew
that
his
foot
was
well
but
at
last
he
made
up
his
mind
and
with
the
toes
of
his
right
foot
he
just
touched
his
left
then
he
passed
his
hand
over
it
he
limped
downstairs
just
as
mary
ann
was
going
into
the
diningroom
for
prayers
and
then
he
sat
down
to
breakfast
youre
very
quiet
this
morning
philip
said
aunt
louisa
presently
hes
thinking
of
the
good
breakfast
hell
have
at
school
tomorrow
said
the
vicar
when
philip
answered
it
was
in
a
way
that
always
irritated
his
uncle
with
something
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
matter
in
hand
he
called
it
a
bad
habit
of
woolgathering
supposing
youd
asked
god
to
do
something
said
philip
and
really
believed
it
was
going
to
happen
like
moving
a
mountain
i
mean
and
you
had
faith
and
it
didnt
happen
what
would
it
mean
what
a
funny
boy
you
are
said
aunt
louisa
you
asked
about
moving
mountains
two
or
three
weeks
ago
it
would
just
mean
that
you
hadnt
got
faith
answered
uncle
william
philip
accepted
the
explanation
if
god
had
not
cured
him
it
was
because
he
did
not
really
believe
and
yet
he
did
not
see
how
he
could
believe
more
than
he
did
but
perhaps
he
had
not
given
god
enough
time
he
had
only
asked
him
for
nineteen
days
in
a
day
or
two
he
began
his
prayer
again
and
this
time
he
fixed
upon
easter
that
was
the
day
of
his
sons
glorious
resurrection
and
god
in
his
happiness
might
be
mercifully
inclined
but
now
philip
added
other
means
of
attaining
his
desire
he
began
to
wish
when
he
saw
a
new
moon
or
a
dappled
horse
and
he
looked
out
for
shooting
stars
during
exeat
they
had
a
chicken
at
the
vicarage
and
he
broke
the
lucky
bone
with
aunt
louisa
and
wished
again
each
time
that
his
foot
might
be
made
whole
he
was
appealing
unconsciously
to
gods
older
to
his
race
than
the
god
of
israel
and
he
bombarded
the
almighty
with
his
prayer
at
odd
times
of
the
day
whenever
it
occurred
to
him
in
identical
words
always
for
it
seemed
to
him
important
to
make
his
request
in
the
same
terms
but
presently
the
feeling
came
to
him
that
this
time
also
his
faith
would
not
be
great
enough
he
could
not
resist
the
doubt
that
assailed
him
he
made
his
own
experience
into
a
general
rule
i
suppose
no
one
ever
has
faith
enough
he
said
it
was
like
the
salt
which
his
nurse
used
to
tell
him
about
you
could
catch
any
bird
by
putting
salt
on
his
tail
and
once
he
had
taken
a
little
bag
of
it
into
kensington
gardens
but
he
could
never
get
near
enough
to
put
the
salt
on
a
birds
tail
before
easter
he
had
given
up
the
struggle
he
felt
a
dull
resentment
against
his
uncle
for
taking
him
in
the
text
which
spoke
of
the
moving
of
mountains
was
just
one
of
those
that
said
one
thing
and
meant
another
he
thought
his
uncle
had
been
playing
a
practical
joke
on
him
chapter
xv
the
kings
school
at
tercanbury
to
which
philip
went
when
he
was
thirteen
prided
itself
on
its
antiquity
it
traced
its
origin
to
an
abbey
school
founded
before
the
conquest
where
the
rudiments
of
learning
were
taught
by
augustine
monks
and
like
many
another
establishment
of
this
sort
on
the
destruction
of
the
monasteries
it
had
been
reorganised
by
the
officers
of
king
henry
viii
and
thus
acquired
its
name
since
then
pursuing
its
modest
course
it
had
given
to
the
sons
of
the
local
gentry
and
of
the
professional
people
of
kent
an
education
sufficient
to
their
needs
one
or
two
men
of
letters
beginning
with
a
poet
than
whom
only
shakespeare
had
a
more
splendid
genius
and
ending
with
a
writer
of
prose
whose
view
of
life
has
affected
profoundly
the
generation
of
which
philip
was
a
member
had
gone
forth
from
its
gates
to
achieve
fame
it
had
produced
one
or
two
eminent
lawyers
but
eminent
lawyers
are
common
and
one
or
two
soldiers
of
distinction
but
during
the
three
centuries
since
its
separation
from
the
monastic
order
it
had
trained
especially
men
of
the
church
bishops
deans
canons
and
above
all
country
clergymen
there
were
boys
in
the
school
whose
fathers
grandfathers
greatgrandfathers
had
been
educated
there
and
had
all
been
rectors
of
parishes
in
the
diocese
of
tercanbury
and
they
came
to
it
with
their
minds
made
up
already
to
be
ordained
but
there
were
signs
notwithstanding
that
even
there
changes
were
coming
for
a
few
repeating
what
they
had
heard
at
home
said
that
the
church
was
no
longer
what
it
used
to
be
it
wasnt
so
much
the
money
but
the
class
of
people
who
went
in
for
it
werent
the
same
and
two
or
three
boys
knew
curates
whose
fathers
were
tradesmen
theyd
rather
go
out
to
the
colonies
in
those
days
the
colonies
were
still
the
last
hope
of
those
who
could
get
nothing
to
do
in
england
than
be
a
curate
under
some
chap
who
wasnt
a
gentleman
at
kings
school
as
at
blackstable
vicarage
a
tradesman
was
anyone
who
was
not
lucky
enough
to
own
land
and
here
a
fine
distinction
was
made
between
the
gentleman
farmer
and
the
landowner
or
did
not
follow
one
of
the
four
professions
to
which
it
was
possible
for
a
gentleman
to
belong
among
the
dayboys
of
whom
there
were
about
a
hundred
and
fifty
sons
of
the
local
gentry
and
of
the
men
stationed
at
the
depot
those
whose
fathers
were
engaged
in
business
were
made
to
feel
the
degradation
of
their
state
the
masters
had
no
patience
with
modern
ideas
of
education
which
they
read
of
sometimes
in
the
times
or
the
guardian
and
hoped
fervently
that
kings
school
would
remain
true
to
its
old
traditions
the
dead
languages
were
taught
with
such
thoroughness
that
an
old
boy
seldom
thought
of
homer
or
virgil
in
after
life
without
a
qualm
of
boredom
and
though
in
the
common
room
at
dinner
one
or
two
bolder
spirits
suggested
that
mathematics
were
of
increasing
importance
the
general
feeling
was
that
they
were
a
less
noble
study
than
the
classics
neither
german
nor
chemistry
was
taught
and
french
only
by
the
formmasters
they
could
keep
order
better
than
a
foreigner
and
since
they
knew
the
grammar
as
well
as
any
frenchman
it
seemed
unimportant
that
none
of
them
could
have
got
a
cup
of
coffee
in
the
restaurant
at
boulogne
unless
the
waiter
had
known
a
little
english
geography
was
taught
chiefly
by
making
boys
draw
maps
and
this
was
a
favourite
occupation
especially
when
the
country
dealt
with
was
mountainous
it
was
possible
to
waste
a
great
deal
of
time
in
drawing
the
andes
or
the
apennines
the
masters
graduates
of
oxford
or
cambridge
were
ordained
and
unmarried
if
by
chance
they
wished
to
marry
they
could
only
do
so
by
accepting
one
of
the
smaller
livings
at
the
disposal
of
the
chapter
but
for
many
years
none
of
them
had
cared
to
leave
the
refined
society
of
tercanbury
which
owing
to
the
cavalry
depot
had
a
martial
as
well
as
an
ecclesiastical
tone
for
the
monotony
of
life
in
a
country
rectory
and
they
were
now
all
men
of
middle
age
the
headmaster
on
the
other
hand
was
obliged
to
be
married
and
he
conducted
the
school
till
age
began
to
tell
upon
him
when
he
retired
he
was
rewarded
with
a
much
better
living
than
any
of
the
undermasters
could
hope
for
and
an
honorary
canonry
but
a
year
before
philip
entered
the
school
a
great
change
had
come
over
it
it
had
been
obvious
for
some
time
that
dr
fleming
who
had
been
headmaster
for
the
quarter
of
a
century
was
become
too
deaf
to
continue
his
work
to
the
greater
glory
of
god
and
when
one
of
the
livings
on
the
outskirts
of
the
city
fell
vacant
with
a
stipend
of
six
hundred
a
year
the
chapter
offered
it
to
him
in
such
a
manner
as
to
imply
that
they
thought
it
high
time
for
him
to
retire
he
could
nurse
his
ailments
comfortably
on
such
an
income
two
or
three
curates
who
had
hoped
for
preferment
told
their
wives
it
was
scandalous
to
give
a
parish
that
needed
a
young
strong
and
energetic
man
to
an
old
fellow
who
knew
nothing
of
parochial
work
and
had
feathered
his
nest
already
but
the
mutterings
of
the
unbeneficed
clergy
do
not
reach
the
ears
of
a
cathedral
chapter
and
as
for
the
parishioners
they
had
nothing
to
say
in
the
matter
and
therefore
nobody
asked
for
their
opinion
the
wesleyans
and
the
baptists
both
had
chapels
in
the
village
when
dr
fleming
was
thus
disposed
of
it
became
necessary
to
find
a
successor
it
was
contrary
to
the
traditions
of
the
school
that
one
of
the
lowermasters
should
be
chosen
the
commonroom
was
unanimous
in
desiring
the
election
of
mr
watson
headmaster
of
the
preparatory
school
he
could
hardly
be
described
as
already
a
master
of
kings
school
they
had
all
known
him
for
twenty
years
and
there
was
no
danger
that
he
would
make
a
nuisance
of
himself
but
the
chapter
sprang
a
surprise
on
them
it
chose
a
man
called
perkins
at
first
nobody
knew
who
perkins
was
and
the
name
favourably
impressed
no
one
but
before
the
shock
of
it
had
passed
away
it
was
realised
that
perkins
was
the
son
of
perkins
the
linendraper
dr
fleming
informed
the
masters
just
before
dinner
and
his
manner
showed
his
consternation
such
of
them
as
were
dining
in
ate
their
meal
almost
in
silence
and
no
reference
was
made
to
the
matter
till
the
servants
had
left
the
room
then
they
set
to
the
names
of
those
present
on
this
occasion
are
unimportant
but
they
had
been
known
to
generations
of
schoolboys
as
sighs
tar
winks
squirts
and
pat
they
all
knew
tom
perkins
the
first
thing
about
him
was
that
he
was
not
a
gentleman
they
remembered
him
quite
well
he
was
a
small
dark
boy
with
untidy
black
hair
and
large
eyes
he
looked
like
a
gipsy
he
had
come
to
the
school
as
a
dayboy
with
the
best
scholarship
on
their
endowment
so
that
his
education
had
cost
him
nothing
of
course
he
was
brilliant
at
every
speechday
he
was
loaded
with
prizes
he
was
their
showboy
and
they
remembered
now
bitterly
their
fear
that
he
would
try
to
get
some
scholarship
at
one
of
the
larger
public
schools
and
so
pass
out
of
their
hands
dr
fleming
had
gone
to
the
linendraper
his
fatherthey
all
remembered
the
shop
perkins
and
cooper
in
st
catherines
streetand
said
he
hoped
tom
would
remain
with
them
till
he
went
to
oxford
the
school
was
perkins
and
coopers
best
customer
and
mr
perkins
was
only
too
glad
to
give
the
required
assurance
tom
perkins
continued
to
triumph
he
was
the
finest
classical
scholar
that
dr
fleming
remembered
and
on
leaving
the
school
took
with
him
the
most
valuable
scholarship
they
had
to
offer
he
got
another
at
magdalen
and
settled
down
to
a
brilliant
career
at
the
university
the
school
magazine
recorded
the
distinctions
he
achieved
year
after
year
and
when
he
got
his
double
first
dr
fleming
himself
wrote
a
few
words
of
eulogy
on
the
front
page
it
was
with
greater
satisfaction
that
they
welcomed
his
success
since
perkins
and
cooper
had
fallen
upon
evil
days
cooper
drank
like
a
fish
and
just
before
tom
perkins
took
his
degree
the
linendrapers
filed
their
petition
in
bankruptcy
in
due
course
tom
perkins
took
holy
orders
and
entered
upon
the
profession
for
which
he
was
so
admirably
suited
he
had
been
an
assistant
master
at
wellington
and
then
at
rugby
but
there
was
quite
a
difference
between
welcoming
his
success
at
other
schools
and
serving
under
his
leadership
in
their
own
tar
had
frequently
given
him
lines
and
squirts
had
boxed
his
ears
they
could
not
imagine
how
the
chapter
had
made
such
a
mistake
no
one
could
be
expected
to
forget
that
he
was
the
son
of
a
bankrupt
linendraper
and
the
alcoholism
of
cooper
seemed
to
increase
the
disgrace
it
was
understood
that
the
dean
had
supported
his
candidature
with
zeal
so
the
dean
would
probably
ask
him
to
dinner
but
would
the
pleasant
little
dinners
in
the
precincts
ever
be
the
same
when
tom
perkins
sat
at
the
table
and
what
about
the
depot
he
really
could
not
expect
officers
and
gentlemen
to
receive
him
as
one
of
themselves
it
would
do
the
school
incalculable
harm
parents
would
be
dissatisfied
and
no
one
could
be
surprised
if
there
were
wholesale
withdrawals
and
then
the
indignity
of
calling
him
mr
perkins
the
masters
thought
by
way
of
protest
of
sending
in
their
resignations
in
a
body
but
the
uneasy
fear
that
they
would
be
accepted
with
equanimity
restrained
them
the
only
thing
is
to
prepare
ourselves
for
changes
said
sighs
who
had
conducted
the
fifth
form
for
five
and
twenty
years
with
unparalleled
incompetence
and
when
they
saw
him
they
were
not
reassured
dr
fleming
invited
them
to
meet
him
at
luncheon
he
was
now
a
man
of
thirtytwo
tall
and
lean
but
with
the
same
wild
and
unkempt
look
they
remembered
on
him
as
a
boy
his
clothes
illmade
and
shabby
were
put
on
untidily
his
hair
was
as
black
and
as
long
as
ever
and
he
had
plainly
never
learned
to
brush
it
it
fell
over
his
forehead
with
every
gesture
and
he
had
a
quick
movement
of
the
hand
with
which
he
pushed
it
back
from
his
eyes
he
had
a
black
moustache
and
a
beard
which
came
high
up
on
his
face
almost
to
the
cheekbones
he
talked
to
the
masters
quite
easily
as
though
he
had
parted
from
them
a
week
or
two
be
fore
he
was
evidently
delighted
to
see
them
he
seemed
unconscious
of
the
strangeness
of
the
position
and
appeared
not
to
notice
any
oddness
in
being
addressed
as
mr
perkins
when
he
bade
them
goodbye
one
of
the
masters
for
something
to
say
remarked
that
he
was
allowing
himself
plenty
of
time
to
catch
his
train
i
want
to
go
round
and
have
a
look
at
the
shop
he
answered
cheerfully
there
was
a
distinct
embarrassment
they
wondered
that
he
could
be
so
tactless
and
to
make
it
worse
dr
fleming
had
not
heard
what
he
said
his
wife
shouted
it
in
his
ear
he
wants
to
go
round
and
look
at
his
fathers
old
shop
only
tom
perkins
was
unconscious
of
the
humiliation
which
the
whole
party
felt
he
turned
to
mrs
fleming
whos
got
it
now
dyou
know
she
could
hardly
answer
she
was
very
angry
its
still
a
linendrapers
she
said
bitterly
grove
is
the
name
we
dont
deal
there
any
more
i
wonder
if
hed
let
me
go
over
the
house
i
expect
he
would
if
you
explain
who
you
are
it
was
not
till
the
end
of
dinner
that
evening
that
any
reference
was
made
in
the
commonroom
to
the
subject
that
was
in
all
their
minds
then
it
was
sighs
who
asked
well
what
did
you
think
of
our
new
head
they
thought
of
the
conversation
at
luncheon
it
was
hardly
a
conversation
it
was
a
monologue
perkins
had
talked
incessantly
he
talked
very
quickly
with
a
flow
of
easy
words
and
in
a
deep
resonant
voice
he
had
a
short
odd
little
laugh
which
showed
his
white
teeth
they
had
followed
him
with
difficulty
for
his
mind
darted
from
subject
to
subject
with
a
connection
they
did
not
always
catch
he
talked
of
pedagogics
and
this
was
natural
enough
but
he
had
much
to
say
of
modern
theories
in
germany
which
they
had
never
heard
of
and
received
with
misgiving
he
talked
of
the
classics
but
he
had
been
to
greece
and
he
discoursed
of
archaeology
he
had
once
spent
a
winter
digging
they
could
not
see
how
that
helped
a
man
to
teach
boys
to
pass
examinations
he
talked
of
politics
it
sounded
odd
to
them
to
hear
him
compare
lord
beaconsfield
with
alcibiades
he
talked
of
mr
gladstone
and
home
rule
they
realised
that
he
was
a
liberal
their
hearts
sank
he
talked
of
german
philosophy
and
of
french
fiction
they
could
not
think
a
man
profound
whose
interests
were
so
diverse
it
was
winks
who
summed
up
the
general
impression
and
put
it
into
a
form
they
all
felt
conclusively
damning
winks
was
the
master
of
the
upper
third
a
weakkneed
man
with
drooping
eyelids
he
was
too
tall
for
his
strength
and
his
movements
were
slow
and
languid
he
gave
an
impression
of
lassitude
and
his
nickname
was
eminently
appropriate
hes
very
enthusiastic
said
winks
enthusiasm
was
illbred
enthusiasm
was
ungentlemanly
they
thought
of
the
salvation
army
with
its
braying
trumpets
and
its
drums
enthusiasm
meant
change
they
had
gooseflesh
when
they
thought
of
all
the
pleasant
old
habits
which
stood
in
imminent
danger
they
hardly
dared
to
look
forward
to
the
future
he
looks
more
of
a
gipsy
than
ever
said
one
after
a
pause
i
wonder
if
the
dean
and
chapter
knew
that
he
was
a
radical
when
they
elected
him
another
observed
bitterly
but
conversation
halted
they
were
too
much
disturbed
for
words
when
tar
and
sighs
were
walking
together
to
the
chapter
house
on
speechday
a
week
later
tar
who
had
a
bitter
tongue
remarked
to
his
colleague
well
weve
seen
a
good
many
speechdays
here
havent
we
i
wonder
if
we
shall
see
another
sighs
was
more
melancholy
even
than
usual
if
anything
worth
having
comes
along
in
the
way
of
a
living
i
dont
mind
when
i
retire
chapter
xvi
a
year
passed
and
when
philip
came
to
the
school
the
old
masters
were
all
in
their
places
but
a
good
many
changes
had
taken
place
notwithstanding
their
stubborn
resistance
none
the
less
formidable
because
it
was
concealed
under
an
apparent
desire
to
fall
in
with
the
new
heads
ideas
though
the
formmasters
still
taught
french
to
the
lower
school
another
master
had
come
with
a
degree
of
doctor
of
philology
from
the
university
of
heidelberg
and
a
record
of
three
years
spent
in
a
french
lycee
to
teach
french
to
the
upper
forms
and
german
to
anyone
who
cared
to
take
it
up
instead
of
greek
another
master
was
engaged
to
teach
mathematics
more
systematically
than
had
been
found
necessary
hitherto
neither
of
these
was
ordained
this
was
a
real
revolution
and
when
the
pair
arrived
the
older
masters
received
them
with
distrust
a
laboratory
had
been
fitted
up
army
classes
were
instituted
they
all
said
the
character
of
the
school
was
changing
and
heaven
only
knew
what
further
projects
mr
perkins
turned
in
that
untidy
head
of
his
the
school
was
small
as
public
schools
go
there
were
not
more
than
two
hundred
boarders
and
it
was
difficult
for
it
to
grow
larger
for
it
was
huddled
up
against
the
cathedral
the
precincts
with
the
exception
of
a
house
in
which
some
of
the
masters
lodged
were
occupied
by
the
cathedral
clergy
and
there
was
no
more
room
for
building
but
mr
perkins
devised
an
elaborate
scheme
by
which
he
might
obtain
sufficient
space
to
make
the
school
double
its
present
size
he
wanted
to
attract
boys
from
london
he
thought
it
would
be
good
for
them
to
be
thrown
in
contact
with
the
kentish
lads
and
it
would
sharpen
the
country
wits
of
these
its
against
all
our
traditions
said
sighs
when
mr
perkins
made
the
suggestion
to
him
weve
rather
gone
out
of
our
way
to
avoid
the
contamination
of
boys
from
london
oh
what
nonsense
said
mr
perkins
no
one
had
ever
told
the
formmaster
before
that
he
talked
nonsense
and
he
was
meditating
an
acid
reply
in
which
perhaps
he
might
insert
a
veiled
reference
to
hosiery
when
mr
perkins
in
his
impetuous
way
attacked
him
outrageously
that
house
in
the
precinctsif
youd
only
marry
id
get
the
chapter
to
put
another
couple
of
stories
on
and
wed
make
dormitories
and
studies
and
your
wife
could
help
you
the
elderly
clergyman
gasped
why
should
he
marry
he
was
fiftyseven
a
man
couldnt
marry
at
fiftyseven
he
couldnt
start
looking
after
a
house
at
his
time
of
life
he
didnt
want
to
marry
if
the
choice
lay
between
that
and
the
country
living
he
would
much
sooner
resign
all
he
wanted
now
was
peace
and
quietness
im
not
thinking
of
marrying
he
said
mr
perkins
looked
at
him
with
his
dark
bright
eyes
and
if
there
was
a
twinkle
in
them
poor
sighs
never
saw
it
what
a
pity
couldnt
you
marry
to
oblige
me
it
would
help
me
a
great
deal
with
the
dean
and
chapter
when
i
suggest
rebuilding
your
house
but
mr
perkins
most
unpopular
innovation
was
his
system
of
taking
occasionally
another
mans
form
he
asked
it
as
a
favour
but
after
all
it
was
a
favour
which
could
not
be
refused
and
as
tar
otherwise
mr
turner
said
it
was
undignified
for
all
parties
he
gave
no
warning
but
after
morning
prayers
would
say
to
one
of
the
masters
i
wonder
if
youd
mind
taking
the
sixth
today
at
eleven
well
change
over
shall
we
they
did
not
know
whether
this
was
usual
at
other
schools
but
certainly
it
had
never
been
done
at
tercanbury
the
results
were
curious
mr
tumer
who
was
the
first
victim
broke
the
news
to
his
form
that
the
headmaster
would
take
them
for
latin
that
day
and
on
the
pretence
that
they
might
like
to
ask
him
a
question
or
two
so
that
they
should
not
make
perfect
fools
of
themselves
spent
the
last
quarter
of
an
hour
of
the
history
lesson
in
construing
for
them
the
passage
of
livy
which
had
been
set
for
the
day
but
when
he
rejoined
his
class
and
looked
at
the
paper
on
which
mr
perkins
had
written
the
marks
a
surprise
awaited
him
for
the
two
boys
at
the
top
of
the
form
seemed
to
have
done
very
ill
while
others
who
had
never
distinguished
themselves
before
were
given
full
marks
when
he
asked
eldridge
his
cleverest
boy
what
was
the
meaning
of
this
the
answer
came
sullenly
mr
perkins
never
gave
us
any
construing
to
do
he
asked
me
what
i
knew
about
general
gordon
mr
turner
looked
at
him
in
astonishment
the
boys
evidently
felt
they
had
been
hardly
used
and
he
could
not
help
agreeing
with
their
silent
dissatisfaction
he
could
not
see
either
what
general
gordon
had
to
do
with
livy
he
hazarded
an
inquiry
afterwards
eldridge
was
dreadfully
put
out
because
you
asked
him
what
he
knew
about
general
gordon
he
said
to
the
headmaster
with
an
attempt
at
a
chuckle
mr
perkins
laughed
i
saw
theyd
got
to
the
agrarian
laws
of
caius
gracchus
and
i
wondered
if
they
knew
anything
about
the
agrarian
troubles
in
ireland
but
all
they
knew
about
ireland
was
that
dublin
was
on
the
liffey
so
i
wondered
if
theyd
ever
heard
of
general
gordon
then
the
horrid
fact
was
disclosed
that
the
new
head
had
a
mania
for
general
information
he
had
doubts
about
the
utility
of
examinations
on
subjects
which
had
been
crammed
for
the
occasion
he
wanted
common
sense
sighs
grew
more
worried
every
month
he
could
not
get
the
thought
out
of
his
head
that
mr
perkins
would
ask
him
to
fix
a
day
for
his
marriage
and
he
hated
the
attitude
the
head
adopted
towards
classical
literature
there
was
no
doubt
that
he
was
a
fine
scholar
and
he
was
engaged
on
a
work
which
was
quite
in
the
right
tradition
he
was
writing
a
treatise
on
the
trees
in
latin
literature
but
he
talked
of
it
flippantly
as
though
it
were
a
pastime
of
no
great
importance
like
billiards
which
engaged
his
leisure
but
was
not
to
be
considered
with
seriousness
and
squirts
the
master
of
the
middle
third
grew
more
illtempered
every
day
it
was
in
his
form
that
philip
was
put
on
entering
the
school
the
rev
b
b
gordon
was
a
man
by
nature
illsuited
to
be
a
schoolmaster
he
was
impatient
and
choleric
with
no
one
to
call
him
to
account
with
only
small
boys
to
face
him
he
had
long
lost
all
power
of
selfcontrol
he
began
his
work
in
a
rage
and
ended
it
in
a
passion
he
was
a
man
of
middle
height
and
of
a
corpulent
figure
he
had
sandy
hair
worn
very
short
and
now
growing
gray
and
a
small
bristly
moustache
his
large
face
with
indistinct
features
and
small
blue
eyes
was
naturally
red
but
during
his
frequent
attacks
of
anger
it
grew
dark
and
purple
his
nails
were
bitten
to
the
quick
for
while
some
trembling
boy
was
construing
he
would
sit
at
his
desk
shaking
with
the
fury
that
consumed
him
and
gnaw
his
fingers
stories
perhaps
exaggerated
were
told
of
his
violence
and
two
years
before
there
had
been
some
excitement
in
the
school
when
it
was
heard
that
one
father
was
threatening
a
prosecution
he
had
boxed
the
ears
of
a
boy
named
walters
with
a
book
so
violently
that
his
hearing
was
affected
and
the
boy
had
to
be
taken
away
from
the
school
the
boys
father
lived
in
tercanbury
and
there
had
been
much
indignation
in
the
city
the
local
paper
had
referred
to
the
matter
but
mr
walters
was
only
a
brewer
so
the
sympathy
was
divided
the
rest
of
the
boys
for
reasons
best
known
to
themselves
though
they
loathed
the
master
took
his
side
in
the
affair
and
to
show
their
indignation
that
the
schools
business
had
been
dealt
with
outside
made
things
as
uncomfortable
as
they
could
for
walters
younger
brother
who
still
remained
but
mr
gordon
had
only
escaped
the
country
living
by
the
skin
of
his
teeth
and
he
had
never
hit
a
boy
since
the
right
the
masters
possessed
to
cane
boys
on
the
hand
was
taken
away
from
them
and
squirts
could
no
longer
emphasize
his
anger
by
beating
his
desk
with
the
cane
he
never
did
more
now
than
take
a
boy
by
the
shoulders
and
shake
him
he
still
made
a
naughty
or
refractory
lad
stand
with
one
arm
stretched
out
for
anything
from
ten
minutes
to
half
an
hour
and
he
was
as
violent
as
before
with
his
tongue
no
master
could
have
been
more
unfitted
to
teach
things
to
so
shy
a
boy
as
philip
he
had
come
to
the
school
with
fewer
terrors
than
he
had
when
first
he
went
to
mr
watsons
he
knew
a
good
many
boys
who
had
been
with
him
at
the
preparatory
school
he
felt
more
grownup
and
instinctively
realised
that
among
the
larger
numbers
his
deformity
would
be
less
noticeable
but
from
the
first
day
mr
gordon
struck
terror
in
his
heart
and
the
master
quick
to
discern
the
boys
who
were
frightened
of
him
seemed
on
that
account
to
take
a
peculiar
dislike
to
him
philip
had
enjoyed
his
work
but
now
he
began
to
look
upon
the
hours
passed
in
school
with
horror
rather
than
risk
an
answer
which
might
be
wrong
and
excite
a
storm
of
abuse
from
the
master
he
would
sit
stupidly
silent
and
when
it
came
towards
his
turn
to
stand
up
and
construe
he
grew
sick
and
white
with
apprehension
his
happy
moments
were
those
when
mr
perkins
took
the
form
he
was
able
to
gratify
the
passion
for
general
knowledge
which
beset
the
headmaster
he
had
read
all
sorts
of
strange
books
beyond
his
years
and
often
mr
perkins
when
a
question
was
going
round
the
room
would
stop
at
philip
with
a
smile
that
filled
the
boy
with
rapture
and
say
now
carey
you
tell
them
the
good
marks
he
got
on
these
occasions
increased
mr
gordons
indignation
one
day
it
came
to
philips
turn
to
translate
and
the
master
sat
there
glaring
at
him
and
furiously
biting
his
thumb
he
was
in
a
ferocious
mood
philip
began
to
speak
in
a
low
voice
dont
mumble
shouted
the
master
something
seemed
to
stick
in
philips
throat
go
on
go
on
go
on
each
time
the
words
were
screamed
more
loudly
the
effect
was
to
drive
all
he
knew
out
of
philips
head
and
he
looked
at
the
printed
page
vacantly
mr
gordon
began
to
breathe
heavily
if
you
dont
know
why
dont
you
say
so
do
you
know
it
or
not
did
you
hear
all
this
construed
last
time
or
not
why
dont
you
speak
speak
you
blockhead
speak
the
master
seized
the
arms
of
his
chair
and
grasped
them
as
though
to
prevent
himself
from
falling
upon
philip
they
knew
that
in
past
days
he
often
used
to
seize
boys
by
the
throat
till
they
almost
choked
the
veins
in
his
forehead
stood
out
and
his
face
grew
dark
and
threatening
he
was
a
man
insane
philip
had
known
the
passage
perfectly
the
day
before
but
now
he
could
remember
nothing
i
dont
know
it
he
gasped
why
dont
you
know
it
lets
take
the
words
one
by
one
well
soon
see
if
you
dont
know
it
philip
stood
silent
very
white
trembling
a
little
with
his
head
bent
down
on
the
book
the
masters
breathing
grew
almost
stertoroussic
the
headmaster
says
youre
clever
i
dont
know
how
he
sees
it
general
information
he
laughed
savagely
i
dont
know
what
they
put
you
in
his
form
for
blockhead
he
was
pleased
with
the
word
and
he
repeated
it
at
the
top
of
his
voice
blockhead
blockhead
clubfooted
blockhead
that
relieved
him
a
little
he
saw
philip
redden
suddenly
he
told
him
to
fetch
the
black
book
philip
put
down
his
caesar
and
went
silently
out
the
black
book
was
a
sombre
volume
in
which
the
names
of
boys
were
written
with
their
misdeeds
and
when
a
name
was
down
three
times
it
meant
a
caning
philip
went
to
the
headmasters
house
and
knocked
at
his
studydoor
mr
perkins
was
seated
at
his
table
may
i
have
the
black
book
please
sir
there
it
is
answered
mr
perkins
indicating
its
place
by
a
nod
of
his
head
what
have
you
been
doing
that
you
shouldnt
i
dont
know
sir
mr
perkins
gave
him
a
quick
look
but
without
answering
went
on
with
his
work
philip
took
the
book
and
went
out
when
the
hour
was
up
a
few
minutes
later
he
brought
it
back
let
me
have
a
look
at
it
said
the
headmaster
i
see
mr
gordon
has
blackbooked
you
for
gross
impertinence
what
was
it
i
dont
know
sir
mr
gordon
said
i
was
a
clubfooted
blockhead
mr
perkins
looked
at
him
again
he
wondered
whether
there
was
sarcasm
behind
the
boys
reply
but
he
was
still
much
too
shaken
his
face
was
white
and
his
eyes
had
a
look
of
terrified
distress
mr
perkins
got
up
and
put
the
book
down
as
he
did
so
he
took
up
some
photographs
a
friend
of
mine
sent
me
some
pictures
of
athens
this
morning
he
said
casually
look
here
theres
the
akropolis
he
began
explaining
to
philip
what
he
saw
the
ruin
grew
vivid
with
his
words
he
showed
him
the
theatre
of
dionysus
and
explained
in
what
order
the
people
sat
and
how
beyond
they
could
see
the
blue
aegean
and
then
suddenly
he
said
i
remember
mr
gordon
used
to
call
me
a
gipsy
counterjumper
when
i
was
in
his
form
and
before
philip
his
mind
fixed
on
the
photographs
had
time
to
gather
the
meaning
of
the
remark
mr
perkins
was
showing
him
a
picture
of
salamis
and
with
his
finger
a
finger
of
which
the
nail
had
a
little
black
edge
to
it
was
pointing
out
how
the
greek
ships
were
placed
and
how
the
persian
chapter
xvii
philip
passed
the
next
two
years
with
comfortable
monotony
he
was
not
bullied
more
than
other
boys
of
his
size
and
his
deformity
withdrawing
him
from
games
acquired
for
him
an
insignificance
for
which
he
was
grateful
he
was
not
popular
and
he
was
very
lonely
he
spent
a
couple
of
terms
with
winks
in
the
upper
third
winks
with
his
weary
manner
and
his
drooping
eyelids
looked
infinitely
bored
he
did
his
duty
but
he
did
it
with
an
abstracted
mind
he
was
kind
gentle
and
foolish
he
had
a
great
belief
in
the
honour
of
boys
he
felt
that
the
first
thing
to
make
them
truthful
was
not
to
let
it
enter
your
head
for
a
moment
that
it
was
possible
for
them
to
lie
ask
much
he
quoted
and
much
shall
be
given
to
you
life
was
easy
in
the
upper
third
you
knew
exactly
what
lines
would
come
to
your
turn
to
construe
and
with
the
crib
that
passed
from
hand
to
hand
you
could
find
out
all
you
wanted
in
two
minutes
you
could
hold
a
latin
grammar
open
on
your
knees
while
questions
were
passing
round
and
winks
never
noticed
anything
odd
in
the
fact
that
the
same
incredible
mistake
was
to
be
found
in
a
dozen
different
exercises
he
had
no
great
faith
in
examinations
for
he
noticed
that
boys
never
did
so
well
in
them
as
in
form
it
was
disappointing
but
not
significant
in
due
course
they
were
moved
up
having
learned
little
but
a
cheerful
effrontery
in
the
distortion
of
truth
which
was
possibly
of
greater
service
to
them
in
after
life
than
an
ability
to
read
latin
at
sight
then
they
fell
into
the
hands
of
tar
his
name
was
turner
he
was
the
most
vivacious
of
the
old
masters
a
short
man
with
an
immense
belly
a
black
beard
turning
now
to
gray
and
a
swarthy
skin
in
his
clerical
dress
there
was
indeed
something
in
him
to
suggest
the
tarbarrel
and
though
on
principle
he
gave
five
hundred
lines
to
any
boy
on
whose
lips
he
overheard
his
nickname
at
dinnerparties
in
the
precincts
he
often
made
little
jokes
about
it
he
was
the
most
worldly
of
the
masters
he
dined
out
more
frequently
than
any
of
the
others
and
the
society
he
kept
was
not
so
exclusively
clerical
the
boys
looked
upon
him
as
rather
a
dog
he
left
off
his
clerical
attire
during
the
holidays
and
had
been
seen
in
switzerland
in
gay
tweeds
he
liked
a
bottle
of
wine
and
a
good
dinner
and
having
once
been
seen
at
the
cafe
royal
with
a
lady
who
was
very
probably
a
near
relation
was
thenceforward
supposed
by
generations
of
schoolboys
to
indulge
in
orgies
the
circumstantial
details
of
which
pointed
to
an
unbounded
belief
in
human
depravity
mr
turner
reckoned
that
it
took
him
a
term
to
lick
boys
into
shape
after
they
had
been
in
the
upper
third
and
now
and
then
he
let
fall
a
sly
hint
which
showed
that
he
knew
perfectly
what
went
on
in
his
colleagues
form
he
took
it
goodhumouredly
he
looked
upon
boys
as
young
ruffians
who
were
more
apt
to
be
truthful
if
it
was
quite
certain
a
lie
would
be
found
out
whose
sense
of
honour
was
peculiar
to
themselves
and
did
not
apply
to
dealings
with
masters
and
who
were
least
likely
to
be
troublesome
when
they
learned
that
it
did
not
pay
he
was
proud
of
his
form
and
as
eager
at
fiftyfive
that
it
should
do
better
in
examinations
than
any
of
the
others
as
he
had
been
when
he
first
came
to
the
school
he
had
the
choler
of
the
obese
easily
roused
and
as
easily
calmed
and
his
boys
soon
discovered
that
there
was
much
kindliness
beneath
the
invective
with
which
he
constantly
assailed
them
he
had
no
patience
with
fools
but
was
willing
to
take
much
trouble
with
boys
whom
he
suspected
of
concealing
intelligence
behind
their
wilfulness
he
was
fond
of
inviting
them
to
tea
and
though
vowing
they
never
got
a
look
in
with
him
at
the
cakes
and
muffins
for
it
was
the
fashion
to
believe
that
his
corpulence
pointed
to
a
voracious
appetite
and
his
voracious
appetite
to
tapeworms
they
accepted
his
invitations
with
real
pleasure
philip
was
now
more
comfortable
for
space
was
so
limited
that
there
were
only
studies
for
boys
in
the
upper
school
and
till
then
he
had
lived
in
the
great
hall
in
which
they
all
ate
and
in
which
the
lower
forms
did
preparation
in
a
promiscuity
which
was
vaguely
distasteful
to
him
now
and
then
it
made
him
restless
to
be
with
people
and
he
wanted
urgently
to
be
alone
he
set
out
for
solitary
walks
into
the
country
there
was
a
little
stream
with
pollards
on
both
sides
of
it
that
ran
through
green
fields
and
it
made
him
happy
he
knew
not
why
to
wander
along
its
banks
when
he
was
tired
he
lay
facedownward
on
the
grass
and
watched
the
eager
scurrying
of
minnows
and
of
tadpoles
it
gave
him
a
peculiar
satisfaction
to
saunter
round
the
precincts
on
the
green
in
the
middle
they
practised
at
nets
in
the
summer
but
during
the
rest
of
the
year
it
was
quiet
boys
used
to
wander
round
sometimes
arm
in
arm
or
a
studious
fellow
with
abstracted
gaze
walked
slowly
repeating
to
himself
something
he
had
to
learn
by
heart
there
was
a
colony
of
rooks
in
the
great
elms
and
they
filled
the
air
with
melancholy
cries
along
one
side
lay
the
cathedral
with
its
great
central
tower
and
philip
who
knew
as
yet
nothing
of
beauty
felt
when
he
looked
at
it
a
troubling
delight
which
he
could
not
understand
when
he
had
a
study
it
was
a
little
square
room
looking
on
a
slum
and
four
boys
shared
it
he
bought
a
photograph
of
that
view
of
the
cathedral
and
pinned
it
up
over
his
desk
and
he
found
himself
taking
a
new
interest
in
what
he
saw
from
the
window
of
the
fourth
form
room
it
looked
on
to
old
lawns
carefully
tended
and
fine
trees
with
foliage
dense
and
rich
it
gave
him
an
odd
feeling
in
his
heart
and
he
did
not
know
if
it
was
pain
or
pleasure
it
was
the
first
dawn
of
the
aesthetic
emotion
it
accompanied
other
changes
his
voice
broke
it
was
no
longer
quite
under
his
control
and
queer
sounds
issued
from
his
throat
then
he
began
to
go
to
the
classes
which
were
held
in
the
headmasters
study
immediately
after
tea
to
prepare
boys
for
confirmation
philips
piety
had
not
stood
the
test
of
time
and
he
had
long
since
given
up
his
nightly
reading
of
the
bible
but
now
under
the
influence
of
mr
perkins
with
this
new
condition
of
the
body
which
made
him
so
restless
his
old
feelings
revived
and
he
reproached
himself
bitterly
for
his
backsliding
the
fires
of
hell
burned
fiercely
before
his
minds
eye
if
he
had
died
during
that
time
when
he
was
little
better
than
an
infidel
he
would
have
been
lost
he
believed
implicitly
in
pain
everlasting
he
believed
in
it
much
more
than
in
eternal
happiness
and
he
shuddered
at
the
dangers
he
had
run
since
the
day
on
which
mr
perkins
had
spoken
kindly
to
him
when
he
was
smarting
under
the
particular
form
of
abuse
which
he
could
least
bear
philip
had
conceived
for
his
headmaster
a
doglike
adoration
he
racked
his
brains
vainly
for
some
way
to
please
him
he
treasured
the
smallest
word
of
commendation
which
by
chance
fell
from
his
lips
and
when
he
came
to
the
quiet
little
meetings
in
his
house
he
was
prepared
to
surrender
himself
entirely
he
kept
his
eyes
fixed
on
mr
perkins
shining
eyes
and
sat
with
mouth
half
open
his
head
a
little
thrown
forward
so
as
to
miss
no
word
the
ordinariness
of
the
surroundings
made
the
matters
they
dealt
with
extraordinarily
moving
and
often
the
master
seized
himself
by
the
wonder
of
his
subject
would
push
back
the
book
in
front
of
him
and
with
his
hands
clasped
together
over
his
heart
as
though
to
still
the
beating
would
talk
of
the
mysteries
of
their
religion
sometimes
philip
did
not
understand
but
he
did
not
want
to
understand
he
felt
vaguely
that
it
was
enough
to
feel
it
seemed
to
him
then
that
the
headmaster
with
his
black
straggling
hair
and
his
pale
face
was
like
those
prophets
of
israel
who
feared
not
to
take
kings
to
task
and
when
he
thought
of
the
redeemer
he
saw
him
only
with
the
same
dark
eyes
and
those
wan
cheeks
mr
perkins
took
this
part
of
his
work
with
great
seriousness
there
was
never
here
any
of
that
flashing
humour
which
made
the
other
masters
suspect
him
of
flippancy
finding
time
for
everything
in
his
busy
day
he
was
able
at
certain
intervals
to
take
separately
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
or
twenty
minutes
the
boys
whom
he
was
preparing
for
confirmation
he
wanted
to
make
them
feel
that
this
was
the
first
consciously
serious
step
in
their
lives
he
tried
to
grope
into
the
depths
of
their
souls
he
wanted
to
instil
in
them
his
own
vehement
devotion
in
philip
notwithstanding
his
shyness
he
felt
the
possibility
of
a
passion
equal
to
his
own
the
boys
temperament
seemed
to
him
essentially
religious
one
day
he
broke
off
suddenly
from
the
subject
on
which
he
had
been
talking
have
you
thought
at
all
what
youre
going
to
be
when
you
grow
up
he
asked
my
uncle
wants
me
to
be
ordained
said
philip
and
you
philip
looked
away
he
was
ashamed
to
answer
that
he
felt
himself
unworthy
i
dont
know
any
life
thats
so
full
of
happiness
as
ours
i
wish
i
could
make
you
feel
what
a
wonderful
privilege
it
is
one
can
serve
god
in
every
walk
but
we
stand
nearer
to
him
i
dont
want
to
influence
you
but
if
you
made
up
your
mindoh
at
onceyou
couldnt
help
feeling
that
joy
and
relief
which
never
desert
one
again
philip
did
not
answer
but
the
headmaster
read
in
his
eyes
that
he
realised
already
something
of
what
he
tried
to
indicate
if
you
go
on
as
you
are
now
youll
find
yourself
head
of
the
school
one
of
these
days
and
you
ought
to
be
pretty
safe
for
a
scholarship
when
you
leave
have
you
got
anything
of
your
own
my
uncle
says
i
shall
have
a
hundred
a
year
when
im
twentyone
youll
be
rich
i
had
nothing
the
headmaster
hesitated
a
moment
and
then
idly
drawing
lines
with
a
pencil
on
the
blotting
paper
in
front
of
him
went
on
im
afraid
your
choice
of
professions
will
be
rather
limited
you
naturally
couldnt
go
in
for
anything
that
required
physical
activity
philip
reddened
to
the
roots
of
his
hair
as
he
always
did
when
any
reference
was
made
to
his
clubfoot
mr
perkins
looked
at
him
gravely
i
wonder
if
youre
not
oversensitive
about
your
misfortune
has
it
ever
struck
you
to
thank
god
for
it
philip
looked
up
quickly
his
lips
tightened
he
remembered
how
for
months
trusting
in
what
they
told
him
he
had
implored
god
to
heal
him
as
he
had
healed
the
leper
and
made
the
blind
to
see
as
long
as
you
accept
it
rebelliously
it
can
only
cause
you
shame
but
if
you
looked
upon
it
as
a
cross
that
was
given
you
to
bear
only
because
your
shoulders
were
strong
enough
to
bear
it
a
sign
of
gods
favour
then
it
would
be
a
source
of
happiness
to
you
instead
of
misery
he
saw
that
the
boy
hated
to
discuss
the
matter
and
he
let
him
go
but
philip
thought
over
all
that
the
headmaster
had
said
and
presently
his
mind
taken
up
entirely
with
the
ceremony
that
was
before
him
a
mystical
rapture
seized
him
his
spirit
seemed
to
free
itself
from
the
bonds
of
the
flesh
and
he
seemed
to
be
living
a
new
life
he
aspired
to
perfection
with
all
the
passion
that
was
in
him
he
wanted
to
surrender
himself
entirely
to
the
service
of
god
and
he
made
up
his
mind
definitely
that
he
would
be
ordained
when
the
great
day
arrived
his
soul
deeply
moved
by
all
the
preparation
by
the
books
he
had
studied
and
above
all
by
the
overwhelming
influence
of
the
head
he
could
hardly
contain
himself
for
fear
and
joy
one
thought
had
tormented
him
he
knew
that
he
would
have
to
walk
alone
through
the
chancel
and
he
dreaded
showing
his
limp
thus
obviously
not
only
to
the
whole
school
who
were
attending
the
service
but
also
to
the
strangers
people
from
the
city
or
parents
who
had
come
to
see
their
sons
confirmed
but
when
the
time
came
he
felt
suddenly
that
he
could
accept
the
humiliation
joyfully
and
as
he
limped
up
the
chancel
very
small
and
insignificant
beneath
the
lofty
vaulting
of
the
cathedral
he
offered
consciously
his
deformity
as
a
sacrifice
to
the
god
who
loved
him
chapter
xviii
but
philip
could
not
live
long
in
the
rarefied
air
of
the
hilltops
what
had
happened
to
him
when
first
he
was
seized
by
the
religious
emotion
happened
to
him
now
because
he
felt
so
keenly
the
beauty
of
faith
because
the
desire
for
selfsacrifice
burned
in
his
heart
with
such
a
gemlike
glow
his
strength
seemed
inadequate
to
his
ambition
he
was
tired
out
by
the
violence
of
his
passion
his
soul
was
filled
on
a
sudden
with
a
singular
aridity
he
began
to
forget
the
presence
of
god
which
had
seemed
so
surrounding
and
his
religious
exercises
still
very
punctually
performed
grew
merely
formal
at
first
he
blamed
himself
for
this
falling
away
and
the
fear
of
hellfire
urged
him
to
renewed
vehemence
but
the
passion
was
dead
and
gradually
other
interests
distracted
his
thoughts
philip
had
few
friends
his
habit
of
reading
isolated
him
it
became
such
a
need
that
after
being
in
company
for
some
time
he
grew
tired
and
restless
he
was
vain
of
the
wider
knowledge
he
had
acquired
from
the
perusal
of
so
many
books
his
mind
was
alert
and
he
had
not
the
skill
to
hide
his
contempt
for
his
companions
stupidity
they
complained
that
he
was
conceited
and
since
he
excelled
only
in
matters
which
to
them
were
unimportant
they
asked
satirically
what
he
had
to
be
conceited
about
he
was
developing
a
sense
of
humour
and
found
that
he
had
a
knack
of
saying
bitter
things
which
caught
people
on
the
raw
he
said
them
because
they
amused
him
hardly
realising
how
much
they
hurt
and
was
much
offended
when
he
found
that
his
victims
regarded
him
with
active
dislike
the
humiliations
he
suffered
when
first
he
went
to
school
had
caused
in
him
a
shrinking
from
his
fellows
which
he
could
never
entirely
overcome
he
remained
shy
and
silent
but
though
he
did
everything
to
alienate
the
sympathy
of
other
boys
he
longed
with
all
his
heart
for
the
popularity
which
to
some
was
so
easily
accorded
these
from
his
distance
he
admired
extravagantly
and
though
he
was
inclined
to
be
more
sarcastic
with
them
than
with
others
though
he
made
little
jokes
at
their
expense
he
would
have
given
anything
to
change
places
with
them
indeed
he
would
gladly
have
changed
places
with
the
dullest
boy
in
the
school
who
was
whole
of
limb
he
took
to
a
singular
habit
he
would
imagine
that
he
was
some
boy
whom
he
had
a
particular
fancy
for
he
would
throw
his
soul
as
it
were
into
the
others
body
talk
with
his
voice
and
laugh
with
his
heart
he
would
imagine
himself
doing
all
the
things
the
other
did
it
was
so
vivid
that
he
seemed
for
a
moment
really
to
be
no
longer
himself
in
this
way
he
enjoyed
many
intervals
of
fantastic
happiness
at
the
beginning
of
the
christmas
term
which
followed
on
his
confirmation
philip
found
himself
moved
into
another
study
one
of
the
boys
who
shared
it
was
called
rose
he
was
in
the
same
form
as
philip
and
philip
had
always
looked
upon
him
with
envious
admiration
he
was
not
goodlooking
though
his
large
hands
and
big
bones
suggested
that
he
would
be
a
tall
man
he
was
clumsily
made
but
his
eyes
were
charming
and
when
he
laughed
he
was
constantly
laughing
his
face
wrinkled
all
round
them
in
a
jolly
way
he
was
neither
clever
nor
stupid
but
good
enough
at
his
work
and
better
at
games
he
was
a
favourite
with
masters
and
boys
and
he
in
his
turn
liked
everyone
when
philip
was
put
in
the
study
he
could
not
help
seeing
that
the
others
who
had
been
together
for
three
terms
welcomed
him
coldly
it
made
him
nervous
to
feel
himself
an
intruder
but
he
had
learned
to
hide
his
feelings
and
they
found
him
quiet
and
unobtrusive
with
rose
because
he
was
as
little
able
as
anyone
else
to
resist
his
charm
philip
was
even
more
than
usually
shy
and
abrupt
and
whether
on
account
of
this
unconsciously
bent
upon
exerting
the
fascination
he
knew
was
his
only
by
the
results
or
whether
from
sheer
kindness
of
heart
it
was
rose
who
first
took
philip
into
the
circle
one
day
quite
suddenly
he
asked
philip
if
he
would
walk
to
the
football
field
with
him
philip
flushed
i
cant
walk
fast
enough
for
you
he
said
rot
come
on
and
just
before
they
were
setting
out
some
boy
put
his
head
in
the
studydoor
and
asked
rose
to
go
with
him
i
cant
he
answered
ive
already
promised
carey
dont
bother
about
me
said
philip
quickly
i
shant
mind
rot
said
rose
he
looked
at
philip
with
those
goodnatured
eyes
of
his
and
laughed
philip
felt
a
curious
tremor
in
his
heart
in
a
little
while
their
friendship
growing
with
boyish
rapidity
the
pair
were
inseparable
other
fellows
wondered
at
the
sudden
intimacy
and
rose
was
asked
what
he
saw
in
philip
oh
i
dont
know
he
answered
hes
not
half
a
bad
chap
really
soon
they
grew
accustomed
to
the
two
walking
into
chapel
arm
in
arm
or
strolling
round
the
precincts
in
conversation
wherever
one
was
the
other
could
be
found
also
and
as
though
acknowledging
his
proprietorship
boys
who
wanted
rose
would
leave
messages
with
carey
philip
at
first
was
reserved
he
would
not
let
himself
yield
entirely
to
the
proud
joy
that
filled
him
but
presently
his
distrust
of
the
fates
gave
way
before
a
wild
happiness
he
thought
rose
the
most
wonderful
fellow
he
had
ever
seen
his
books
now
were
insignificant
he
could
not
bother
about
them
when
there
was
something
infinitely
more
important
to
occupy
him
roses
friends
used
to
come
in
to
tea
in
the
study
sometimes
or
sit
about
when
there
was
nothing
better
to
dorose
liked
a
crowd
and
the
chance
of
a
ragand
they
found
that
philip
was
quite
a
decent
fellow
philip
was
happy
when
the
last
day
of
term
came
he
and
rose
arranged
by
which
train
they
should
come
back
so
that
they
might
meet
at
the
station
and
have
tea
in
the
town
before
returning
to
school
philip
went
home
with
a
heavy
heart
he
thought
of
rose
all
through
the
holidays
and
his
fancy
was
active
with
the
things
they
would
do
together
next
term
he
was
bored
at
the
vicarage
and
when
on
the
last
day
his
uncle
put
him
the
usual
question
in
the
usual
facetious
tone
well
are
you
glad
to
be
going
back
to
school
philip
answered
joyfully
rather
in
order
to
be
sure
of
meeting
rose
at
the
station
he
took
an
earlier
train
than
he
usually
did
and
he
waited
about
the
platform
for
an
hour
when
the
train
came
in
from
faversham
where
he
knew
rose
had
to
change
he
ran
along
it
excitedly
but
rose
was
not
there
he
got
a
porter
to
tell
him
when
another
train
was
due
and
he
waited
but
again
he
was
disappointed
and
he
was
cold
and
hungry
so
he
walked
through
sidestreets
and
slums
by
a
short
cut
to
the
school
he
found
rose
in
the
study
with
his
feet
on
the
chimneypiece
talking
eighteen
to
the
dozen
with
half
a
dozen
boys
who
were
sitting
on
whatever
there
was
to
sit
on
he
shook
hands
with
philip
enthusiastically
but
philips
face
fell
for
he
realised
that
rose
had
forgotten
all
about
their
appointment
i
say
why
are
you
so
late
said
rose
i
thought
you
were
never
coming
you
were
at
the
station
at
halfpast
four
said
another
boy
i
saw
you
when
i
came
philip
blushed
a
little
he
did
not
want
rose
to
know
that
he
had
been
such
a
fool
as
to
wait
for
him
i
had
to
see
about
a
friend
of
my
peoples
he
invented
readily
i
was
asked
to
see
her
off
but
his
disappointment
made
him
a
little
sulky
he
sat
in
silence
and
when
spoken
to
answered
in
monosyllables
he
was
making
up
his
mind
to
have
it
out
with
rose
when
they
were
alone
but
when
the
others
had
gone
rose
at
once
came
over
and
sat
on
the
arm
of
the
chair
in
which
philip
was
lounging
i
say
im
jolly
glad
were
in
the
same
study
this
term
ripping
isnt
it
he
seemed
so
genuinely
pleased
to
see
philip
that
philips
annoyance
vanished
they
began
as
if
they
had
not
been
separated
for
five
minutes
to
talk
eagerly
of
the
thousand
things
that
interested
them
chapter
xix
at
first
philip
had
been
too
grateful
for
roses
friendship
to
make
any
demands
on
him
he
took
things
as
they
came
and
enjoyed
life
but
presently
he
began
to
resent
roses
universal
amiability
he
wanted
a
more
exclusive
attachment
and
he
claimed
as
a
right
what
before
he
had
accepted
as
a
favour
he
watched
jealously
roses
companionship
with
others
and
though
he
knew
it
was
unreasonable
could
not
help
sometimes
saying
bitter
things
to
him
if
rose
spent
an
hour
playing
the
fool
in
another
study
philip
would
receive
him
when
he
returned
to
his
own
with
a
sullen
frown
he
would
sulk
for
a
day
and
he
suffered
more
because
rose
either
did
not
notice
his
illhumour
or
deliberately
ignored
it
not
seldom
philip
knowing
all
the
time
how
stupid
he
was
would
force
a
quarrel
and
they
would
not
speak
to
one
another
for
a
couple
of
days
but
philip
could
not
bear
to
be
angry
with
him
long
and
even
when
convinced
that
he
was
in
the
right
would
apologise
humbly
then
for
a
week
they
would
be
as
great
friends
as
ever
but
the
best
was
over
and
philip
could
see
that
rose
often
walked
with
him
merely
from
old
habit
or
from
fear
of
his
anger
they
had
not
so
much
to
say
to
one
another
as
at
first
and
rose
was
often
bored
philip
felt
that
his
lameness
began
to
irritate
him
towards
the
end
of
the
term
two
or
three
boys
caught
scarlet
fever
and
there
was
much
talk
of
sending
them
all
home
in
order
to
escape
an
epidemic
but
the
sufferers
were
isolated
and
since
no
more
were
attacked
it
was
supposed
that
the
outbreak
was
stopped
one
of
the
stricken
was
philip
he
remained
in
hospital
through
the
easter
holidays
and
at
the
beginning
of
the
summer
term
was
sent
home
to
the
vicarage
to
get
a
little
fresh
air
the
vicar
notwithstanding
medical
assurance
that
the
boy
was
no
longer
infectious
received
him
with
suspicion
he
thought
it
very
inconsiderate
of
the
doctor
to
suggest
that
his
nephews
convalescence
should
be
spent
by
the
seaside
and
consented
to
have
him
in
the
house
only
because
there
was
nowhere
else
he
could
go
philip
went
back
to
school
at
halfterm
he
had
forgotten
the
quarrels
he
had
had
with
rose
but
remembered
only
that
he
was
his
greatest
friend
he
knew
that
he
had
been
silly
he
made
up
his
mind
to
be
more
reasonable
during
his
illness
rose
had
sent
him
in
a
couple
of
little
notes
and
he
had
ended
each
with
the
words
hurry
up
and
come
back
philip
thought
rose
must
be
looking
forward
as
much
to
his
return
as
he
was
himself
to
seeing
rose
he
found
that
owing
to
the
death
from
scarlet
fever
of
one
of
the
boys
in
the
sixth
there
had
been
some
shifting
in
the
studies
and
rose
was
no
longer
in
his
it
was
a
bitter
disappointment
but
as
soon
as
he
arrived
he
burst
into
roses
study
rose
was
sitting
at
his
desk
working
with
a
boy
called
hunter
and
turned
round
crossly
as
philip
came
in
who
the
devils
that
he
cried
and
then
seeing
philip
oh
its
you
philip
stopped
in
embarrassment
i
thought
id
come
in
and
see
how
you
were
we
were
just
working
hunter
broke
into
the
conversation
when
did
you
get
back
five
minutes
ago
they
sat
and
looked
at
him
as
though
he
was
disturbing
them
they
evidently
expected
him
to
go
quickly
philip
reddened
ill
be
off
you
might
look
in
when
youve
done
he
said
to
rose
all
right
philip
closed
the
door
behind
him
and
limped
back
to
his
own
study
he
felt
frightfully
hurt
rose
far
from
seeming
glad
to
see
him
had
looked
almost
put
out
they
might
never
have
been
more
than
acquaintances
though
he
waited
in
his
study
not
leaving
it
for
a
moment
in
case
just
then
rose
should
come
his
friend
never
appeared
and
next
morning
when
he
went
in
to
prayers
he
saw
rose
and
hunter
singing
along
arm
in
arm
what
he
could
not
see
for
himself
others
told
him
he
had
forgotten
that
three
months
is
a
long
time
in
a
schoolboys
life
and
though
he
had
passed
them
in
solitude
rose
had
lived
in
the
world
hunter
had
stepped
into
the
vacant
place
philip
found
that
rose
was
quietly
avoiding
him
but
he
was
not
the
boy
to
accept
a
situation
without
putting
it
into
words
he
waited
till
he
was
sure
rose
was
alone
in
his
study
and
went
in
may
i
come
in
he
asked
rose
looked
at
him
with
an
embarrassment
that
made
him
angry
with
philip
yes
if
you
want
to
its
very
kind
of
you
said
philip
sarcastically
what
dyou
want
i
say
why
have
you
been
so
rotten
since
i
came
back
oh
dont
be
an
ass
said
rose
i
dont
know
what
you
see
in
hunter
thats
my
business
philip
looked
down
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
say
what
was
in
his
heart
he
was
afraid
of
humiliating
himself
rose
got
up
ive
got
to
go
to
the
gym
he
said
when
he
was
at
the
door
philip
forced
himself
to
speak
i
say
rose
dont
be
a
perfect
beast
oh
go
to
hell
rose
slammed
the
door
behind
him
and
left
philip
alone
philip
shivered
with
rage
he
went
back
to
his
study
and
turned
the
conversation
over
in
his
mind
he
hated
rose
now
he
wanted
to
hurt
him
he
thought
of
biting
things
he
might
have
said
to
him
he
brooded
over
the
end
to
their
friendship
and
fancied
that
others
were
talking
of
it
in
his
sensitiveness
he
saw
sneers
and
wonderings
in
other
fellows
manner
when
they
were
not
bothering
their
heads
with
him
at
all
he
imagined
to
himself
what
they
were
saying
after
all
it
wasnt
likely
to
last
long
i
wonder
he
ever
stuck
carey
at
all
blighter
to
show
his
indifference
he
struck
up
a
violent
friendship
with
a
boy
called
sharp
whom
he
hated
and
despised
he
was
a
london
boy
with
a
loutish
air
a
heavy
fellow
with
the
beginnings
of
a
moustache
on
his
lip
and
bushy
eyebrows
that
joined
one
another
across
the
bridge
of
his
nose
he
had
soft
hands
and
manners
too
suave
for
his
years
he
spoke
with
the
suspicion
of
a
cockney
accent
he
was
one
of
those
boys
who
are
too
slack
to
play
games
and
he
exercised
great
ingenuity
in
making
excuses
to
avoid
such
as
were
compulsory
he
was
regarded
by
boys
and
masters
with
a
vague
dislike
and
it
was
from
arrogance
that
philip
now
sought
his
society
sharp
in
a
couple
of
terms
was
going
to
germany
for
a
year
he
hated
school
which
he
looked
upon
as
an
indignity
to
be
endured
till
he
was
old
enough
to
go
out
into
the
world
london
was
all
he
cared
for
and
he
had
many
stories
to
tell
of
his
doings
there
during
the
holidays
from
his
conversationhe
spoke
in
a
soft
deeptoned
voicethere
emerged
the
vague
rumour
of
the
london
streets
by
night
philip
listened
to
him
at
once
fascinated
and
repelled
with
his
vivid
fancy
he
seemed
to
see
the
surging
throng
round
the
pitdoor
of
theatres
and
the
glitter
of
cheap
restaurants
bars
where
men
half
drunk
sat
on
high
stools
talking
with
barmaids
and
under
the
street
lamps
the
mysterious
passing
of
dark
crowds
bent
upon
pleasure
sharp
lent
him
cheap
novels
from
holywell
row
which
philip
read
in
his
cubicle
with
a
sort
of
wonderful
fear
once
rose
tried
to
effect
a
reconciliation
he
was
a
goodnatured
fellow
who
did
not
like
having
enemies
i
say
carey
why
are
you
being
such
a
silly
ass
it
doesnt
do
you
any
good
cutting
me
and
all
that
i
dont
know
what
you
mean
answered
philip
well
i
dont
see
why
you
shouldnt
talk
you
bore
me
said
philip
please
yourself
rose
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
left
him
philip
was
very
white
as
he
always
became
when
he
was
moved
and
his
heart
beat
violently
when
rose
went
away
he
felt
suddenly
sick
with
misery
he
did
not
know
why
he
had
answered
in
that
fashion
he
would
have
given
anything
to
be
friends
with
rose
he
hated
to
have
quarrelled
with
him
and
now
that
he
saw
he
had
given
him
pain
he
was
very
sorry
but
at
the
moment
he
had
not
been
master
of
himself
it
seemed
that
some
devil
had
seized
him
forcing
him
to
say
bitter
things
against
his
will
even
though
at
the
time
he
wanted
to
shake
hands
with
rose
and
meet
him
more
than
halfway
the
desire
to
wound
had
been
too
strong
for
him
he
had
wanted
to
revenge
himself
for
the
pain
and
the
humiliation
he
had
endured
it
was
pride
it
was
folly
too
for
he
knew
that
rose
would
not
care
at
all
while
he
would
suffer
bitterly
the
thought
came
to
him
that
he
would
go
to
rose
and
say
i
say
im
sorry
i
was
such
a
beast
i
couldnt
help
it
lets
make
it
up
but
he
knew
he
would
never
be
able
to
do
it
he
was
afraid
that
rose
would
sneer
at
him
he
was
angry
with
himself
and
when
sharp
came
in
a
little
while
afterwards
he
seized
upon
the
first
opportunity
to
quarrel
with
him
philip
had
a
fiendish
instinct
for
discovering
other
peoples
raw
spots
and
was
able
to
say
things
that
rankled
because
they
were
true
but
sharp
had
the
last
word
i
heard
rose
talking
about
you
to
mellor
just
now
he
said
mellor
said
why
didnt
you
kick
him
it
would
teach
him
manners
and
rose
said
i
didnt
like
to
damned
cripple
philip
suddenly
became
scarlet
he
could
not
answer
for
there
was
a
lump
in
his
throat
that
almost
choked
him
chapter
xx
philip
was
moved
into
the
sixth
but
he
hated
school
now
with
all
his
heart
and
having
lost
his
ambition
cared
nothing
whether
he
did
ill
or
well
he
awoke
in
the
morning
with
a
sinking
heart
because
he
must
go
through
another
day
of
drudgery
he
was
tired
of
having
to
do
things
because
he
was
told
and
the
restrictions
irked
him
not
because
they
were
unreasonable
but
because
they
were
restrictions
he
yearned
for
freedom
he
was
weary
of
repeating
things
that
he
knew
already
and
of
the
hammering
away
for
the
sake
of
a
thickwitted
fellow
at
something
that
he
understood
from
the
beginning
with
mr
perkins
you
could
work
or
not
as
you
chose
he
was
at
once
eager
and
abstracted
the
sixth
form
room
was
in
a
part
of
the
old
abbey
which
had
been
restored
and
it
had
a
gothic
window
philip
tried
to
cheat
his
boredom
by
drawing
this
over
and
over
again
and
sometimes
out
of
his
head
he
drew
the
great
tower
of
the
cathedral
or
the
gateway
that
led
into
the
precincts
he
had
a
knack
for
drawing
aunt
louisa
during
her
youth
had
painted
in
water
colours
and
she
had
several
albums
filled
with
sketches
of
churches
old
bridges
and
picturesque
cottages
they
were
often
shown
at
the
vicarage
teaparties
she
had
once
given
philip
a
paintbox
as
a
christmas
present
and
he
had
started
by
copying
her
pictures
he
copied
them
better
than
anyone
could
have
expected
and
presently
he
did
little
pictures
of
his
own
mrs
carey
encouraged
him
it
was
a
good
way
to
keep
him
out
of
mischief
and
later
on
his
sketches
would
be
useful
for
bazaars
two
or
three
of
them
had
been
framed
and
hung
in
his
bedroom
but
one
day
at
the
end
of
the
mornings
work
mr
perkins
stopped
him
as
he
was
lounging
out
of
the
formroom
i
want
to
speak
to
you
carey
philip
waited
mr
perkins
ran
his
lean
fingers
through
his
beard
and
looked
at
philip
he
seemed
to
be
thinking
over
what
he
wanted
to
say
whats
the
matter
with
you
carey
he
said
abruptly
philip
flushing
looked
at
him
quickly
but
knowing
him
well
by
now
without
answering
he
waited
for
him
to
go
on
ive
been
dissatisfied
with
you
lately
youve
been
slack
and
inattentive
you
seem
to
take
no
interest
in
your
work
its
been
slovenly
and
bad
im
very
sorry
sir
said
philip
is
that
all
you
have
to
say
for
yourself
philip
looked
down
sulkily
how
could
he
answer
that
he
was
bored
to
death
you
know
this
term
youll
go
down
instead
of
up
i
shant
give
you
a
very
good
report
philip
wondered
what
he
would
say
if
he
knew
how
the
report
was
treated
it
arrived
at
breakfast
mr
carey
glanced
at
it
indifferently
and
passed
it
over
to
philip
theres
your
report
youd
better
see
what
it
says
he
remarked
as
he
ran
his
fingers
through
the
wrapper
of
a
catalogue
of
secondhand
books
philip
read
it
is
it
good
asked
aunt
louisa
not
so
good
as
i
deserve
answered
philip
with
a
smile
giving
it
to
her
ill
read
it
afterwards
when
ive
got
my
spectacles
she
said
but
after
breakfast
mary
ann
came
in
to
say
the
butcher
was
there
and
she
generally
forgot
mr
perkins
went
on
im
disappointed
with
you
and
i
cant
understand
i
know
you
can
do
things
if
you
want
to
but
you
dont
seem
to
want
to
any
more
i
was
going
to
make
you
a
monitor
next
term
but
i
think
id
better
wait
a
bit
philip
flushed
he
did
not
like
the
thought
of
being
passed
over
he
tightened
his
lips
and
theres
something
else
you
must
begin
thinking
of
your
scholarship
now
you
wont
get
anything
unless
you
start
working
very
seriously
philip
was
irritated
by
the
lecture
he
was
angry
with
the
headmaster
and
angry
with
himself
i
dont
think
im
going
up
to
oxford
he
said
why
not
i
thought
your
idea
was
to
be
ordained
ive
changed
my
mind
why
philip
did
not
answer
mr
perkins
holding
himself
oddly
as
he
always
did
like
a
figure
in
one
of
peruginos
pictures
drew
his
fingers
thoughtfully
through
his
beard
he
looked
at
philip
as
though
he
were
trying
to
understand
and
then
abruptly
told
him
he
might
go
apparently
he
was
not
satisfied
for
one
evening
a
week
later
when
philip
had
to
go
into
his
study
with
some
papers
he
resumed
the
conversation
but
this
time
he
adopted
a
different
method
he
spoke
to
philip
not
as
a
schoolmaster
with
a
boy
but
as
one
human
being
with
another
he
did
not
seem
to
care
now
that
philips
work
was
poor
that
he
ran
small
chance
against
keen
rivals
of
carrying
off
the
scholarship
necessary
for
him
to
go
to
oxford
the
important
matter
was
his
changed
intention
about
his
life
afterwards
mr
perkins
set
himself
to
revive
his
eagerness
to
be
ordained
with
infinite
skill
he
worked
on
his
feelings
and
this
was
easier
since
he
was
himself
genuinely
moved
philips
change
of
mind
caused
him
bitter
distress
and
he
really
thought
he
was
throwing
away
his
chance
of
happiness
in
life
for
he
knew
not
what
his
voice
was
very
persuasive
and
philip
easily
moved
by
the
emotion
of
others
very
emotional
himself
notwithstanding
a
placid
exteriorhis
face
partly
by
nature
but
also
from
the
habit
of
all
these
years
at
school
seldom
except
by
his
quick
flushing
showed
what
he
feltphilip
was
deeply
touched
by
what
the
master
said
he
was
very
grateful
to
him
for
the
interest
he
showed
and
he
was
consciencestricken
by
the
grief
which
he
felt
his
behaviour
caused
him
it
was
subtly
flattering
to
know
that
with
the
whole
school
to
think
about
mr
perkins
should
trouble
with
him
but
at
the
same
time
something
else
in
him
like
another
person
standing
at
his
elbow
clung
desperately
to
two
words
i
wont
i
wont
i
wont
he
felt
himself
slipping
he
was
powerless
against
the
weakness
that
seemed
to
well
up
in
him
it
was
like
the
water
that
rises
up
in
an
empty
bottle
held
over
a
full
basin
and
he
set
his
teeth
saying
the
words
over
and
over
to
himself
i
wont
i
wont
i
wont
at
last
mr
perkins
put
his
hand
on
philips
shoulder
i
dont
want
to
influence
you
he
said
you
must
decide
for
yourself
pray
to
almighty
god
for
help
and
guidance
when
philip
came
out
of
the
headmasters
house
there
was
a
light
rain
falling
he
went
under
the
archway
that
led
to
the
precincts
there
was
not
a
soul
there
and
the
rooks
were
silent
in
the
elms
he
walked
round
slowly
he
felt
hot
and
the
rain
did
him
good
he
thought
over
all
that
mr
perkins
had
said
calmly
now
that
he
was
withdrawn
from
the
fervour
of
his
personality
and
he
was
thankful
he
had
not
given
way
in
the
darkness
he
could
but
vaguely
see
the
great
mass
of
the
cathedral
he
hated
it
now
because
of
the
irksomeness
of
the
long
services
which
he
was
forced
to
attend
the
anthem
was
interminable
and
you
had
to
stand
drearily
while
it
was
being
sung
you
could
not
hear
the
droning
sermon
and
your
body
twitched
because
you
had
to
sit
still
when
you
wanted
to
move
about
then
philip
thought
of
the
two
services
every
sunday
at
blackstable
the
church
was
bare
and
cold
and
there
was
a
smell
all
about
one
of
pomade
and
starched
clothes
the
curate
preached
once
and
his
uncle
preached
once
as
he
grew
up
he
had
learned
to
know
his
uncle
philip
was
downright
and
intolerant
and
he
could
not
understand
that
a
man
might
sincerely
say
things
as
a
clergyman
which
he
never
acted
up
to
as
a
man
the
deception
outraged
him
his
uncle
was
a
weak
and
selfish
man
whose
chief
desire
it
was
to
be
saved
trouble
mr
perkins
had
spoken
to
him
of
the
beauty
of
a
life
dedicated
to
the
service
of
god
philip
knew
what
sort
of
lives
the
clergy
led
in
the
corner
of
east
anglia
which
was
his
home
there
was
the
vicar
of
whitestone
a
parish
a
little
way
from
blackstable
he
was
a
bachelor
and
to
give
himself
something
to
do
had
lately
taken
up
farming
the
local
paper
constantly
reported
the
cases
he
had
in
the
county
court
against
this
one
and
that
labourers
he
would
not
pay
their
wages
to
or
tradesmen
whom
he
accused
of
cheating
him
scandal
said
he
starved
his
cows
and
there
was
much
talk
about
some
general
action
which
should
be
taken
against
him
then
there
was
the
vicar
of
ferne
a
bearded
fine
figure
of
a
man
his
wife
had
been
forced
to
leave
him
because
of
his
cruelty
and
she
had
filled
the
neighbourhood
with
stories
of
his
immorality
the
vicar
of
surle
a
tiny
hamlet
by
the
sea
was
to
be
seen
every
evening
in
the
public
house
a
stones
throw
from
his
vicarage
and
the
churchwardens
had
been
to
mr
carey
to
ask
his
advice
there
was
not
a
soul
for
any
of
them
to
talk
to
except
small
farmers
or
fishermen
there
were
long
winter
evenings
when
the
wind
blew
whistling
drearily
through
the
leafless
trees
and
all
around
they
saw
nothing
but
the
bare
monotony
of
ploughed
fields
and
there
was
poverty
and
there
was
lack
of
any
work
that
seemed
to
matter
every
kink
in
their
characters
had
free
play
there
was
nothing
to
restrain
them
they
grew
narrow
and
eccentric
philip
knew
all
this
but
in
his
young
intolerance
he
did
not
offer
it
as
an
excuse
he
shivered
at
the
thought
of
leading
such
a
life
he
wanted
to
get
out
into
the
world
chapter
xxi
mr
perkins
soon
saw
that
his
words
had
had
no
effect
on
philip
and
for
the
rest
of
the
term
ignored
him
he
wrote
a
report
which
was
vitriolic
when
it
arrived
and
aunt
louisa
asked
philip
what
it
was
like
he
answered
cheerfully
rotten
is
it
said
the
vicar
i
must
look
at
it
again
do
you
think
theres
any
use
in
my
staying
on
at
tercanbury
i
should
have
thought
it
would
be
better
if
i
went
to
germany
for
a
bit
what
has
put
that
in
your
head
said
aunt
louisa
dont
you
think
its
rather
a
good
idea
sharp
had
already
left
kings
school
and
had
written
to
philip
from
hanover
he
was
really
starting
life
and
it
made
philip
more
restless
to
think
of
it
he
felt
he
could
not
bear
another
year
of
restraint
but
then
you
wouldnt
get
a
scholarship
i
havent
a
chance
of
getting
one
anyhow
and
besides
i
dont
know
that
i
particularly
want
to
go
to
oxford
but
if
youre
going
to
be
ordained
philip
aunt
louisa
exclaimed
in
dismay
ive
given
up
that
idea
long
ago
mrs
carey
looked
at
him
with
startled
eyes
and
then
used
to
selfrestraint
she
poured
out
another
cup
of
tea
for
his
uncle
they
did
not
speak
in
a
moment
philip
saw
tears
slowly
falling
down
her
cheeks
his
heart
was
suddenly
wrung
because
he
caused
her
pain
in
her
tight
black
dress
made
by
the
dressmaker
down
the
street
with
her
wrinkled
face
and
pale
tired
eyes
her
gray
hair
still
done
in
the
frivolous
ringlets
of
her
youth
she
was
a
ridiculous
but
strangely
pathetic
figure
philip
saw
it
for
the
first
time
afterwards
when
the
vicar
was
shut
up
in
his
study
with
the
curate
he
put
his
arms
round
her
waist
i
say
im
sorry
youre
upset
aunt
louisa
he
said
but
its
no
good
my
being
ordained
if
i
havent
a
real
vocation
is
it
im
so
disappointed
philip
she
moaned
id
set
my
heart
on
it
i
thought
you
could
be
your
uncles
curate
and
then
when
our
time
cameafter
all
we
cant
last
for
ever
can
weyou
might
have
taken
his
place
philip
shivered
he
was
seized
with
panic
his
heart
beat
like
a
pigeon
in
a
trap
beating
with
its
wings
his
aunt
wept
softly
her
head
upon
his
shoulder
i
wish
youd
persuade
uncle
william
to
let
me
leave
tercanbury
im
so
sick
of
it
but
the
vicar
of
blackstable
did
not
easily
alter
any
arrangements
he
had
made
and
it
had
always
been
intended
that
philip
should
stay
at
kings
school
till
he
was
eighteen
and
should
then
go
to
oxford
at
all
events
he
would
not
hear
of
philip
leaving
then
for
no
notice
had
been
given
and
the
terms
fee
would
have
to
be
paid
in
any
case
then
will
you
give
notice
for
me
to
leave
at
christmas
said
philip
at
the
end
of
a
long
and
often
bitter
conversation
ill
write
to
mr
perkins
about
it
and
see
what
he
says
oh
i
wish
to
goodness
i
were
twentyone
it
is
awful
to
be
at
somebody
elses
beck
and
call
philip
you
shouldnt
speak
to
your
uncle
like
that
said
mrs
carey
gently
but
dont
you
see
that
perkins
will
want
me
to
stay
he
gets
so
much
a
head
for
every
chap
in
the
school
why
dont
you
want
to
go
to
oxford
whats
the
good
if
im
not
going
into
the
church
you
cant
go
into
the
church
youre
in
the
church
already
said
the
vicar
ordained
then
replied
philip
impatiently
what
are
you
going
to
be
philip
asked
mrs
carey
i
dont
know
ive
not
made
up
my
mind
but
whatever
i
am
itll
be
useful
to
know
foreign
languages
i
shall
get
far
more
out
of
a
year
in
germany
than
by
staying
on
at
that
hole
he
would
not
say
that
he
felt
oxford
would
be
little
better
than
a
continuation
of
his
life
at
school
he
wished
immensely
to
be
his
own
master
besides
he
would
be
known
to
a
certain
extent
among
old
schoolfellows
and
he
wanted
to
get
away
from
them
all
he
felt
that
his
life
at
school
had
been
a
failure
he
wanted
to
start
fresh
it
happened
that
his
desire
to
go
to
germany
fell
in
with
certain
ideas
which
had
been
of
late
discussed
at
blackstable
sometimes
friends
came
to
stay
with
the
doctor
and
brought
news
of
the
world
outside
and
the
visitors
spending
august
by
the
sea
had
their
own
way
of
looking
at
things
the
vicar
had
heard
that
there
were
people
who
did
not
think
the
oldfashioned
education
so
useful
nowadays
as
it
had
been
in
the
past
and
modern
languages
were
gaining
an
importance
which
they
had
not
had
in
his
own
youth
his
own
mind
was
divided
for
a
younger
brother
of
his
had
been
sent
to
germany
when
he
failed
in
some
examination
thus
creating
a
precedent
but
since
he
had
there
died
of
typhoid
it
was
impossible
to
look
upon
the
experiment
as
other
than
dangerous
the
result
of
innumerable
conversations
was
that
philip
should
go
back
to
tercanbury
for
another
term
and
then
should
leave
with
this
agreement
philip
was
not
dissatisfied
but
when
he
had
been
back
a
few
days
the
headmaster
spoke
to
him
ive
had
a
letter
from
your
uncle
it
appears
you
want
to
go
to
germany
and
he
asks
me
what
i
think
about
it
philip
was
astounded
he
was
furious
with
his
guardian
for
going
back
on
his
word
i
thought
it
was
settled
sir
he
said
far
from
it
ive
written
to
say
i
think
it
the
greatest
mistake
to
take
you
away
philip
immediately
sat
down
and
wrote
a
violent
letter
to
his
uncle
he
did
not
measure
his
language
he
was
so
angry
that
he
could
not
get
to
sleep
till
quite
late
that
night
and
he
awoke
in
the
early
morning
and
began
brooding
over
the
way
they
had
treated
him
he
waited
impatiently
for
an
answer
in
two
or
three
days
it
came
it
was
a
mild
pained
letter
from
aunt
louisa
saying
that
he
should
not
write
such
things
to
his
uncle
who
was
very
much
distressed
he
was
unkind
and
unchristian
he
must
know
they
were
only
trying
to
do
their
best
for
him
and
they
were
so
much
older
than
he
that
they
must
be
better
judges
of
what
was
good
for
him
philip
clenched
his
hands
he
had
heard
that
statement
so
often
and
he
could
not
see
why
it
was
true
they
did
not
know
the
conditions
as
he
did
why
should
they
accept
it
as
selfevident
that
their
greater
age
gave
them
greater
wisdom
the
letter
ended
with
the
information
that
mr
carey
had
withdrawn
the
notice
he
had
given
philip
nursed
his
wrath
till
the
next
halfholiday
they
had
them
on
tuesdays
and
thursdays
since
on
saturday
afternoons
they
had
to
go
to
a
service
in
the
cathedral
he
stopped
behind
when
the
rest
of
the
sixth
went
out
may
i
go
to
blackstable
this
afternoon
please
sir
he
asked
no
said
the
headmaster
briefly
i
wanted
to
see
my
uncle
about
something
very
important
didnt
you
hear
me
say
no
philip
did
not
answer
he
went
out
he
felt
almost
sick
with
humiliation
the
humiliation
of
having
to
ask
and
the
humiliation
of
the
curt
refusal
he
hated
the
headmaster
now
philip
writhed
under
that
despotism
which
never
vouchsafed
a
reason
for
the
most
tyrannous
act
he
was
too
angry
to
care
what
he
did
and
after
dinner
walked
down
to
the
station
by
the
back
ways
he
knew
so
well
just
in
time
to
catch
the
train
to
blackstable
he
walked
into
the
vicarage
and
found
his
uncle
and
aunt
sitting
in
the
diningroom
hulloa
where
have
you
sprung
from
said
the
vicar
it
was
very
clear
that
he
was
not
pleased
to
see
him
he
looked
a
little
uneasy
i
thought
id
come
and
see
you
about
my
leaving
i
want
to
know
what
you
mean
by
promising
me
one
thing
when
i
was
here
and
doing
something
different
a
week
after
he
was
a
little
frightened
at
his
own
boldness
but
he
had
made
up
his
mind
exactly
what
words
to
use
and
though
his
heart
beat
violently
he
forced
himself
to
say
them
have
you
got
leave
to
come
here
this
afternoon
no
i
asked
perkins
and
he
refused
if
you
like
to
write
and
tell
him
ive
been
here
you
can
get
me
into
a
really
fine
old
row
mrs
carey
sat
knitting
with
trembling
hands
she
was
unused
to
scenes
and
they
agitated
her
extremely
it
would
serve
you
right
if
i
told
him
said
mr
carey
if
you
like
to
be
a
perfect
sneak
you
can
after
writing
to
perkins
as
you
did
youre
quite
capable
of
it
it
was
foolish
of
philip
to
say
that
because
it
gave
the
vicar
exactly
the
opportunity
he
wanted
im
not
going
to
sit
still
while
you
say
impertinent
things
to
me
he
said
with
dignity
he
got
up
and
walked
quickly
out
of
the
room
into
his
study
philip
heard
him
shut
the
door
and
lock
it
oh
i
wish
to
god
i
were
twentyone
it
is
awful
to
be
tied
down
like
this
aunt
louisa
began
to
cry
quietly
oh
philip
you
oughtnt
to
have
spoken
to
your
uncle
like
that
do
please
go
and
tell
him
youre
sorry
im
not
in
the
least
sorry
hes
taking
a
mean
advantage
of
course
its
just
waste
of
money
keeping
me
on
at
school
but
what
does
he
care
its
not
his
money
it
was
cruel
to
put
me
under
the
guardianship
of
people
who
know
nothing
about
things
philip
philip
in
his
voluble
anger
stopped
suddenly
at
the
sound
of
her
voice
it
was
heartbroken
he
had
not
realised
what
bitter
things
he
was
saying
philip
how
can
you
be
so
unkind
you
know
we
are
only
trying
to
do
our
best
for
you
and
we
know
that
we
have
no
experience
it
isnt
as
if
wed
had
any
children
of
our
own
thats
why
we
consulted
mr
perkins
her
voice
broke
ive
tried
to
be
like
a
mother
to
you
ive
loved
you
as
if
you
were
my
own
son
she
was
so
small
and
frail
there
was
something
so
pathetic
in
her
oldmaidish
air
that
philip
was
touched
a
great
lump
came
suddenly
in
his
throat
and
his
eyes
filled
with
tears
im
so
sorry
he
said
i
didnt
mean
to
be
beastly
he
knelt
down
beside
her
and
took
her
in
his
arms
and
kissed
her
wet
withered
cheeks
she
sobbed
bitterly
and
he
seemed
to
feel
on
a
sudden
the
pity
of
that
wasted
life
she
had
never
surrendered
herself
before
to
such
a
display
of
emotion
i
know
ive
not
been
what
i
wanted
to
be
to
you
philip
but
i
didnt
know
how
its
been
just
as
dreadful
for
me
to
have
no
children
as
for
you
to
have
no
mother
philip
forgot
his
anger
and
his
own
concerns
but
thought
only
of
consoling
her
with
broken
words
and
clumsy
little
caresses
then
the
clock
struck
and
he
had
to
bolt
off
at
once
to
catch
the
only
train
that
would
get
him
back
to
tercanbury
in
time
for
callover
as
he
sat
in
the
corner
of
the
railway
carriage
he
saw
that
he
had
done
nothing
he
was
angry
with
himself
for
his
weakness
it
was
despicable
to
have
allowed
himself
to
be
turned
from
his
purpose
by
the
pompous
airs
of
the
vicar
and
the
tears
of
his
aunt
but
as
the
result
of
he
knew
not
what
conversations
between
the
couple
another
letter
was
written
to
the
headmaster
mr
perkins
read
it
with
an
impatient
shrug
of
the
shoulders
he
showed
it
to
philip
it
ran
dear
mr
perkins
forgive
me
for
troubling
you
again
about
my
ward
but
both
his
aunt
and
i
have
been
uneasy
about
him
he
seems
very
anxious
to
leave
school
and
his
aunt
thinks
he
is
unhappy
it
is
very
difficult
for
us
to
know
what
to
do
as
we
are
not
his
parents
he
does
not
seem
to
think
he
is
doing
very
well
and
he
feels
it
is
wasting
his
money
to
stay
on
i
should
be
very
much
obliged
if
you
would
have
a
talk
to
him
and
if
he
is
still
of
the
same
mind
perhaps
it
would
be
better
if
he
left
at
christmas
as
i
originally
intended
yours
very
truly
william
carey
philip
gave
him
back
the
letter
he
felt
a
thrill
of
pride
in
his
triumph
he
had
got
his
own
way
and
he
was
satisfied
his
will
had
gained
a
victory
over
the
wills
of
others
its
not
much
good
my
spending
half
an
hour
writing
to
your
uncle
if
he
changes
his
mind
the
next
letter
he
gets
from
you
said
the
headmaster
irritably
philip
said
nothing
and
his
face
was
perfectly
placid
but
he
could
not
prevent
the
twinkle
in
his
eyes
mr
perkins
noticed
it
and
broke
into
a
little
laugh
youve
rather
scored
havent
you
he
said
then
philip
smiled
outright
he
could
not
conceal
his
exultation
is
it
true
that
youre
very
anxious
to
leave
yes
sir
are
you
unhappy
here
philip
blushed
he
hated
instinctively
any
attempt
to
get
into
the
depths
of
his
feelings
oh
i
dont
know
sir
mr
perkins
slowly
dragging
his
fingers
through
his
beard
looked
at
him
thoughtfully
he
seemed
to
speak
almost
to
himself
of
course
schools
are
made
for
the
average
the
holes
are
all
round
and
whatever
shape
the
pegs
are
they
must
wedge
in
somehow
one
hasnt
time
to
bother
about
anything
but
the
average
then
suddenly
he
addressed
himself
to
philip
look
here
ive
got
a
suggestion
to
make
to
you
its
getting
on
towards
the
end
of
the
term
now
another
term
wont
kill
you
and
if
you
want
to
go
to
germany
youd
better
go
after
easter
than
after
christmas
itll
be
much
pleasanter
in
the
spring
than
in
midwinter
if
at
the
end
of
the
next
term
you
still
want
to
go
ill
make
no
objection
what
dyou
say
to
that
thank
you
very
much
sir
philip
was
so
glad
to
have
gained
the
last
three
months
that
he
did
not
mind
the
extra
term
the
school
seemed
less
of
a
prison
when
he
knew
that
before
easter
he
would
be
free
from
it
for
ever
his
heart
danced
within
him
that
evening
in
chapel
he
looked
round
at
the
boys
standing
according
to
their
forms
each
in
his
due
place
and
he
chuckled
with
satisfaction
at
the
thought
that
soon
he
would
never
see
them
again
it
made
him
regard
them
almost
with
a
friendly
feeling
his
eyes
rested
on
rose
rose
took
his
position
as
a
monitor
very
seriously
he
had
quite
an
idea
of
being
a
good
influence
in
the
school
it
was
his
turn
to
read
the
lesson
that
evening
and
he
read
it
very
well
philip
smiled
when
he
thought
that
he
would
be
rid
of
him
for
ever
and
it
would
not
matter
in
six
months
whether
rose
was
tall
and
straightlimbed
and
where
would
the
importance
be
that
he
was
a
monitor
and
captain
of
the
eleven
philip
looked
at
the
masters
in
their
gowns
gordon
was
dead
he
had
died
of
apoplexy
two
years
before
but
all
the
rest
were
there
philip
knew
now
what
a
poor
lot
they
were
except
turner
perhaps
there
was
something
of
a
man
in
him
and
he
writhed
at
the
thought
of
the
subjection
in
which
they
had
held
him
in
six
months
they
would
not
matter
either
their
praise
would
mean
nothing
to
him
and
he
would
shrug
his
shoulders
at
their
censure
philip
had
learned
not
to
express
his
emotions
by
outward
signs
and
shyness
still
tormented
him
but
he
had
often
very
high
spirits
and
then
though
he
limped
about
demurely
silent
and
reserved
it
seemed
to
be
hallooing
in
his
heart
he
seemed
to
himself
to
walk
more
lightly
all
sorts
of
ideas
danced
through
his
head
fancies
chased
one
another
so
furiously
that
he
could
not
catch
them
but
their
coming
and
their
going
filled
him
with
exhilaration
now
being
happy
he
was
able
to
work
and
during
the
remaining
weeks
of
the
term
set
himself
to
make
up
for
his
long
neglect
his
brain
worked
easily
and
he
took
a
keen
pleasure
in
the
activity
of
his
intellect
he
did
very
well
in
the
examinations
that
closed
the
term
mr
perkins
made
only
one
remark
he
was
talking
to
him
about
an
essay
he
had
written
and
after
the
usual
criticisms
said
so
youve
made
up
your
mind
to
stop
playing
the
fool
for
a
bit
have
you
he
smiled
at
him
with
his
shining
teeth
and
philip
looking
down
gave
an
embarrassed
smile
the
half
dozen
boys
who
expected
to
divide
between
them
the
various
prizes
which
were
given
at
the
end
of
the
summer
term
had
ceased
to
look
upon
philip
as
a
serious
rival
but
now
they
began
to
regard
him
with
some
uneasiness
he
told
no
one
that
he
was
leaving
at
easter
and
so
was
in
no
sense
a
competitor
but
left
them
to
their
anxieties
he
knew
that
rose
flattered
himself
on
his
french
for
he
had
spent
two
or
three
holidays
in
france
and
he
expected
to
get
the
deans
prize
for
english
essay
philip
got
a
good
deal
of
satisfaction
in
watching
his
dismay
when
he
saw
how
much
better
philip
was
doing
in
these
subjects
than
himself
another
fellow
norton
could
not
go
to
oxford
unless
he
got
one
of
the
scholarships
at
the
disposal
of
the
school
he
asked
philip
if
he
was
going
in
for
them
have
you
any
objection
asked
philip
it
entertained
him
to
think
that
he
held
someone
elses
future
in
his
hand
there
was
something
romantic
in
getting
these
various
rewards
actually
in
his
grasp
and
then
leaving
them
to
others
because
he
disdained
them
at
last
the
breakingup
day
came
and
he
went
to
mr
perkins
to
bid
him
goodbye
you
dont
mean
to
say
you
really
want
to
leave
philips
face
fell
at
the
headmasters
evident
surprise
you
said
you
wouldnt
put
any
objection
in
the
way
sir
he
answered
i
thought
it
was
only
a
whim
that
id
better
humour
i
know
youre
obstinate
and
headstrong
what
on
earth
dyou
want
to
leave
for
now
youve
only
got
another
term
in
any
case
you
can
get
the
magdalen
scholarship
easily
youll
get
half
the
prizes
weve
got
to
give
philip
looked
at
him
sullenly
he
felt
that
he
had
been
tricked
but
he
had
the
promise
and
perkins
would
have
to
stand
by
it
youll
have
a
very
pleasant
time
at
oxford
you
neednt
decide
at
once
what
youre
going
to
do
afterwards
i
wonder
if
you
realise
how
delightful
the
life
is
up
there
for
anyone
who
has
brains
ive
made
all
my
arrangements
now
to
go
to
germany
sir
said
philip
are
they
arrangements
that
couldnt
possibly
be
altered
asked
mr
perkins
with
his
quizzical
smile
i
shall
be
very
sorry
to
lose
you
in
schools
the
rather
stupid
boys
who
work
always
do
better
than
the
clever
boy
whos
idle
but
when
the
clever
boy
workswhy
then
he
does
what
youve
done
this
term
philip
flushed
darkly
he
was
unused
to
compliments
and
no
one
had
ever
told
him
he
was
clever
the
headmaster
put
his
hand
on
philips
shoulder
you
know
driving
things
into
the
heads
of
thickwitted
boys
is
dull
work
but
when
now
and
then
you
have
the
chance
of
teaching
a
boy
who
comes
halfway
towards
you
who
understands
almost
before
youve
got
the
words
out
of
your
mouth
why
then
teaching
is
the
most
exhilarating
thing
in
the
world
philip
was
melted
by
kindness
it
had
never
occurred
to
him
that
it
mattered
really
to
mr
perkins
whether
he
went
or
stayed
he
was
touched
and
immensely
flattered
it
would
be
pleasant
to
end
up
his
schooldays
with
glory
and
then
go
to
oxford
in
a
flash
there
appeared
before
him
the
life
which
he
had
heard
described
from
boys
who
came
back
to
play
in
the
oks
match
or
in
letters
from
the
university
read
out
in
one
of
the
studies
but
he
was
ashamed
he
would
look
such
a
fool
in
his
own
eyes
if
he
gave
in
now
his
uncle
would
chuckle
at
the
success
of
the
headmasters
ruse
it
was
rather
a
comedown
from
the
dramatic
surrender
of
all
these
prizes
which
were
in
his
reach
because
he
disdained
to
take
them
to
the
plain
ordinary
winning
of
them
it
only
required
a
little
more
persuasion
just
enough
to
save
his
selfrespect
and
philip
would
have
done
anything
that
mr
perkins
wished
but
his
face
showed
nothing
of
his
conflicting
emotions
it
was
placid
and
sullen
i
think
id
rather
go
sir
he
said
mr
perkins
like
many
men
who
manage
things
by
their
personal
influence
grew
a
little
impatient
when
his
power
was
not
immediately
manifest
he
had
a
great
deal
of
work
to
do
and
could
not
waste
more
time
on
a
boy
who
seemed
to
him
insanely
obstinate
very
well
i
promised
to
let
you
if
you
really
wanted
it
and
i
keep
my
promise
when
do
you
go
to
germany
philips
heart
beat
violently
the
battle
was
won
and
he
did
not
know
whether
he
had
not
rather
lost
it
at
the
beginning
of
may
sir
he
answered
well
you
must
come
and
see
us
when
you
get
back
he
held
out
his
hand
if
he
had
given
him
one
more
chance
philip
would
have
changed
his
mind
but
he
seemed
to
look
upon
the
matter
as
settled
philip
walked
out
of
the
house
his
schooldays
were
over
and
he
was
free
but
the
wild
exultation
to
which
he
had
looked
forward
at
that
moment
was
not
there
he
walked
round
the
precincts
slowly
and
a
profound
depression
seized
him
he
wished
now
that
he
had
not
been
foolish
he
did
not
want
to
go
but
he
knew
he
could
never
bring
himself
to
go
to
the
headmaster
and
tell
him
he
would
stay
that
was
a
humiliation
he
could
never
put
upon
himself
he
wondered
whether
he
had
done
right
he
was
dissatisfied
with
himself
and
with
all
his
circumstances
he
asked
himself
dully
whether
whenever
you
got
your
way
you
wished
afterwards
that
you
hadnt
chapter
xxii
philips
uncle
had
an
old
friend
called
miss
wilkinson
who
lived
in
berlin
she
was
the
daughter
of
a
clergyman
and
it
was
with
her
father
the
rector
of
a
village
in
lincolnshire
that
mr
carey
had
spent
his
last
curacy
on
his
death
forced
to
earn
her
living
she
had
taken
various
situations
as
a
governess
in
france
and
germany
she
had
kept
up
a
correspondence
with
mrs
carey
and
two
or
three
times
had
spent
her
holidays
at
blackstable
vicarage
paying
as
was
usual
with
the
careys
unfrequent
guests
a
small
sum
for
her
keep
when
it
became
clear
that
it
was
less
trouble
to
yield
to
philips
wishes
than
to
resist
them
mrs
carey
wrote
to
ask
her
for
advice
miss
wilkinson
recommended
heidelberg
as
an
excellent
place
to
learn
german
in
and
the
house
of
frau
professor
erlin
as
a
comfortable
home
philip
might
live
there
for
thirty
marks
a
week
and
the
professor
himself
a
teacher
at
the
local
high
school
would
instruct
him
philip
arrived
in
heidelberg
one
morning
in
may
his
things
were
put
on
a
barrow
and
he
followed
the
porter
out
of
the
station
the
sky
was
bright
blue
and
the
trees
in
the
avenue
through
which
they
passed
were
thick
with
leaves
there
was
something
in
the
air
fresh
to
philip
and
mingled
with
the
timidity
he
felt
at
entering
on
a
new
life
among
strangers
was
a
great
exhilaration
he
was
a
little
disconsolate
that
no
one
had
come
to
meet
him
and
felt
very
shy
when
the
porter
left
him
at
the
front
door
of
a
big
white
house
an
untidy
lad
let
him
in
and
took
him
into
a
drawingroom
it
was
filled
with
a
large
suite
covered
in
green
velvet
and
in
the
middle
was
a
round
table
on
this
in
water
stood
a
bouquet
of
flowers
tightly
packed
together
in
a
paper
frill
like
the
bone
of
a
mutton
chop
and
carefully
spaced
round
it
were
books
in
leather
bindings
there
was
a
musty
smell
presently
with
an
odour
of
cooking
the
frau
professor
came
in
a
short
very
stout
woman
with
tightly
dressed
hair
and
a
red
face
she
had
little
eyes
sparkling
like
beads
and
an
effusive
manner
she
took
both
philips
hands
and
asked
him
about
miss
wilkinson
who
had
twice
spent
a
few
weeks
with
her
she
spoke
in
german
and
in
broken
english
philip
could
not
make
her
understand
that
he
did
not
know
miss
wilkinson
then
her
two
daughters
appeared
they
seemed
hardly
young
to
philip
but
perhaps
they
were
not
more
than
twentyfive
the
elder
thekla
was
as
short
as
her
mother
with
the
same
rather
shifty
air
but
with
a
pretty
face
and
abundant
dark
hair
anna
her
younger
sister
was
tall
and
plain
but
since
she
had
a
pleasant
smile
philip
immediately
preferred
her
after
a
few
minutes
of
polite
conversation
the
frau
professor
took
philip
to
his
room
and
left
him
it
was
in
a
turret
looking
over
the
tops
of
the
trees
in
the
anlage
and
the
bed
was
in
an
alcove
so
that
when
you
sat
at
the
desk
it
had
not
the
look
of
a
bedroom
at
all
philip
unpacked
his
things
and
set
out
all
his
books
he
was
his
own
master
at
last
a
bell
summoned
him
to
dinner
at
one
oclock
and
he
found
the
frau
professors
guests
assembled
in
the
drawingroom
he
was
introduced
to
her
husband
a
tall
man
of
middle
age
with
a
large
fair
head
turning
now
to
gray
and
mild
blue
eyes
he
spoke
to
philip
in
correct
rather
archaic
english
having
learned
it
from
a
study
of
the
english
classics
not
from
conversation
and
it
was
odd
to
hear
him
use
words
colloquially
which
philip
had
only
met
in
the
plays
of
shakespeare
frau
professor
erlin
called
her
establishment
a
family
and
not
a
pension
but
it
would
have
required
the
subtlety
of
a
metaphysician
to
find
out
exactly
where
the
difference
lay
when
they
sat
down
to
dinner
in
a
long
dark
apartment
that
led
out
of
the
drawingroom
philip
feeling
very
shy
saw
that
there
were
sixteen
people
the
frau
professor
sat
at
one
end
and
carved
the
service
was
conducted
with
a
great
clattering
of
plates
by
the
same
clumsy
lout
who
had
opened
the
door
for
him
and
though
he
was
quick
it
happened
that
the
first
persons
to
be
served
had
finished
before
the
last
had
received
their
appointed
portions
the
frau
professor
insisted
that
nothing
but
german
should
be
spoken
so
that
philip
even
if
his
bashfulness
had
permitted
him
to
be
talkative
was
forced
to
hold
his
tongue
he
looked
at
the
people
among
whom
he
was
to
live
by
the
frau
professor
sat
several
old
ladies
but
philip
did
not
give
them
much
of
his
attention
there
were
two
young
girls
both
fair
and
one
of
them
very
pretty
whom
philip
heard
addressed
as
fraulein
hedwig
and
fraulein
cacilie
fraulein
cacilie
had
a
long
pigtail
hanging
down
her
back
they
sat
side
by
side
and
chattered
to
one
another
with
smothered
laughter
now
and
then
they
glanced
at
philip
and
one
of
them
said
something
in
an
undertone
they
both
giggled
and
philip
blushed
awkwardly
feeling
that
they
were
making
fun
of
him
near
them
sat
a
chinaman
with
a
yellow
face
and
an
expansive
smile
who
was
studying
western
conditions
at
the
university
he
spoke
so
quickly
with
a
queer
accent
that
the
girls
could
not
always
understand
him
and
then
they
burst
out
laughing
he
laughed
too
goodhumouredly
and
his
almond
eyes
almost
closed
as
he
did
so
there
were
two
or
three
american
men
in
black
coats
rather
yellow
and
dry
of
skin
they
were
theological
students
philip
heard
the
twang
of
their
new
england
accent
through
their
bad
german
and
he
glanced
at
them
with
suspicion
for
he
had
been
taught
to
look
upon
americans
as
wild
and
desperate
barbarians
afterwards
when
they
had
sat
for
a
little
on
the
stiff
green
velvet
chairs
of
the
drawingroom
fraulein
anna
asked
philip
if
he
would
like
to
go
for
a
walk
with
them
philip
accepted
the
invitation
they
were
quite
a
party
there
were
the
two
daughters
of
the
frau
professor
the
two
other
girls
one
of
the
american
students
and
philip
philip
walked
by
the
side
of
anna
and
fraulein
hedwig
he
was
a
little
fluttered
he
had
never
known
any
girls
at
blackstable
there
were
only
the
farmers
daughters
and
the
girls
of
the
local
tradesmen
he
knew
them
by
name
and
by
sight
but
he
was
timid
and
he
thought
they
laughed
at
his
deformity
he
accepted
willingly
the
difference
which
the
vicar
and
mrs
carey
put
between
their
own
exalted
rank
and
that
of
the
farmers
the
doctor
had
two
daughters
but
they
were
both
much
older
than
philip
and
had
been
married
to
successive
assistants
while
philip
was
still
a
small
boy
at
school
there
had
been
two
or
three
girls
of
more
boldness
than
modesty
whom
some
of
the
boys
knew
and
desperate
stories
due
in
all
probability
to
the
masculine
imagination
were
told
of
intrigues
with
them
but
philip
had
always
concealed
under
a
lofty
contempt
the
terror
with
which
they
filled
him
his
imagination
and
the
books
he
had
read
had
inspired
in
him
a
desire
for
the
byronic
attitude
and
he
was
torn
between
a
morbid
selfconsciousness
and
a
conviction
that
he
owed
it
to
himself
to
be
gallant
he
felt
now
that
he
should
be
bright
and
amusing
but
his
brain
seemed
empty
and
he
could
not
for
the
life
of
him
think
of
anything
to
say
fraulein
anna
the
frau
professors
daughter
addressed
herself
to
him
frequently
from
a
sense
of
duty
but
the
other
said
little
she
looked
at
him
now
and
then
with
sparkling
eyes
and
sometimes
to
his
confusion
laughed
outright
philip
felt
that
she
thought
him
perfectly
ridiculous
they
walked
along
the
side
of
a
hill
among
pinetrees
and
their
pleasant
odour
caused
philip
a
keen
delight
the
day
was
warm
and
cloudless
at
last
they
came
to
an
eminence
from
which
they
saw
the
valley
of
the
rhine
spread
out
before
them
under
the
sun
it
was
a
vast
stretch
of
country
sparkling
with
golden
light
with
cities
in
the
distance
and
through
it
meandered
the
silver
ribband
of
the
river
wide
spaces
are
rare
in
the
corner
of
kent
which
philip
knew
the
sea
offers
the
only
broad
horizon
and
the
immense
distance
he
saw
now
gave
him
a
peculiar
an
indescribable
thrill
he
felt
suddenly
elated
though
he
did
not
know
it
it
was
the
first
time
that
he
had
experienced
quite
undiluted
with
foreign
emotions
the
sense
of
beauty
they
sat
on
a
bench
the
three
of
them
for
the
others
had
gone
on
and
while
the
girls
talked
in
rapid
german
philip
indifferent
to
their
proximity
feasted
his
eyes
by
jove
i
am
happy
he
said
to
himself
unconsciously
chapter
xxiii
philip
thought
occasionally
of
the
kings
school
at
tercanbury
and
laughed
to
himself
as
he
remembered
what
at
some
particular
moment
of
the
day
they
were
doing
now
and
then
he
dreamed
that
he
was
there
still
and
it
gave
him
an
extraordinary
satisfaction
on
awaking
to
realise
that
he
was
in
his
little
room
in
the
turret
from
his
bed
he
could
see
the
great
cumulus
clouds
that
hung
in
the
blue
sky
he
revelled
in
his
freedom
he
could
go
to
bed
when
he
chose
and
get
up
when
the
fancy
took
him
there
was
no
one
to
order
him
about
it
struck
him
that
he
need
not
tell
any
more
lies
it
had
been
arranged
that
professor
erlin
should
teach
him
latin
and
german
a
frenchman
came
every
day
to
give
him
lessons
in
french
and
the
frau
professor
had
recommended
for
mathematics
an
englishman
who
was
taking
a
philological
degree
at
the
university
this
was
a
man
named
wharton
philip
went
to
him
every
morning
he
lived
in
one
room
on
the
top
floor
of
a
shabby
house
it
was
dirty
and
untidy
and
it
was
filled
with
a
pungent
odour
made
up
of
many
different
stinks
he
was
generally
in
bed
when
philip
arrived
at
ten
oclock
and
he
jumped
out
put
on
a
filthy
dressinggown
and
felt
slippers
and
while
he
gave
instruction
ate
his
simple
breakfast
he
was
a
short
man
stout
from
excessive
beer
drinking
with
a
heavy
moustache
and
long
unkempt
hair
he
had
been
in
germany
for
five
years
and
was
become
very
teutonic
he
spoke
with
scorn
of
cambridge
where
he
had
taken
his
degree
and
with
horror
of
the
life
which
awaited
him
when
having
taken
his
doctorate
in
heidelberg
he
must
return
to
england
and
a
pedagogic
career
he
adored
the
life
of
the
german
university
with
its
happy
freedom
and
its
jolly
companionships
he
was
a
member
of
a
burschenschaft
and
promised
to
take
philip
to
a
kneipe
he
was
very
poor
and
made
no
secret
that
the
lessons
he
was
giving
philip
meant
the
difference
between
meat
for
his
dinner
and
bread
and
cheese
sometimes
after
a
heavy
night
he
had
such
a
headache
that
he
could
not
drink
his
coffee
and
he
gave
his
lesson
with
heaviness
of
spirit
for
these
occasions
he
kept
a
few
bottles
of
beer
under
the
bed
and
one
of
these
and
a
pipe
would
help
him
to
bear
the
burden
of
life
a
hair
of
the
dog
that
bit
him
he
would
say
as
he
poured
out
the
beer
carefully
so
that
the
foam
should
not
make
him
wait
too
long
to
drink
then
he
would
talk
to
philip
of
the
university
the
quarrels
between
rival
corps
the
duels
and
the
merits
of
this
and
that
professor
philip
learnt
more
of
life
from
him
than
of
mathematics
sometimes
wharton
would
sit
back
with
a
laugh
and
say
look
here
weve
not
done
anything
today
you
neednt
pay
me
for
the
lesson
oh
it
doesnt
matter
said
philip
this
was
something
new
and
very
interesting
and
he
felt
that
it
was
of
greater
import
than
trigonometry
which
he
never
could
understand
it
was
like
a
window
on
life
that
he
had
a
chance
of
peeping
through
and
he
looked
with
a
wildly
beating
heart
no
you
can
keep
your
dirty
money
said
wharton
but
how
about
your
dinner
said
philip
with
a
smile
for
he
knew
exactly
how
his
masters
finances
stood
wharton
had
even
asked
him
to
pay
him
the
two
shillings
which
the
lesson
cost
once
a
week
rather
than
once
a
month
since
it
made
things
less
complicated
oh
never
mind
my
dinner
it
wont
be
the
first
time
ive
dined
off
a
bottle
of
beer
and
my
minds
never
clearer
than
when
i
do
he
dived
under
the
bed
the
sheets
were
gray
with
want
of
washing
and
fished
out
another
bottle
philip
who
was
young
and
did
not
know
the
good
things
of
life
refused
to
share
it
with
him
so
he
drank
alone
how
long
are
you
going
to
stay
here
asked
wharton
both
he
and
philip
had
given
up
with
relief
the
pretence
of
mathematics
oh
i
dont
know
i
suppose
about
a
year
then
my
people
want
me
to
go
to
oxford
wharton
gave
a
contemptuous
shrug
of
the
shoulders
it
was
a
new
experience
for
philip
to
learn
that
there
were
persons
who
did
not
look
upon
that
seat
of
learning
with
awe
what
dyou
want
to
go
there
for
youll
only
be
a
glorified
schoolboy
why
dont
you
matriculate
here
a
years
no
good
spend
five
years
here
you
know
there
are
two
good
things
in
life
freedom
of
thought
and
freedom
of
action
in
france
you
get
freedom
of
action
you
can
do
what
you
like
and
nobody
bothers
but
you
must
think
like
everybody
else
in
germany
you
must
do
what
everybody
else
does
but
you
may
think
as
you
choose
theyre
both
very
good
things
i
personally
prefer
freedom
of
thought
but
in
england
you
get
neither
youre
ground
down
by
convention
you
cant
think
as
you
like
and
you
cant
act
as
you
like
thats
because
its
a
democratic
nation
i
expect
americas
worse
he
leaned
back
cautiously
for
the
chair
on
which
he
sat
had
a
ricketty
leg
and
it
was
disconcerting
when
a
rhetorical
flourish
was
interrupted
by
a
sudden
fall
to
the
floor
i
ought
to
go
back
to
england
this
year
but
if
i
can
scrape
together
enough
to
keep
body
and
soul
on
speaking
terms
i
shall
stay
another
twelve
months
but
then
i
shall
have
to
go
and
i
must
leave
all
thishe
waved
his
arm
round
the
dirty
garret
with
its
unmade
bed
the
clothes
lying
on
the
floor
a
row
of
empty
beer
bottles
against
the
wall
piles
of
unbound
ragged
books
in
every
cornerfor
some
provincial
university
where
i
shall
try
and
get
a
chair
of
philology
and
i
shall
play
tennis
and
go
to
teaparties
he
interrupted
himself
and
gave
philip
very
neatly
dressed
with
a
clean
collar
on
and
his
hair
wellbrushed
a
quizzical
look
and
my
god
i
shall
have
to
wash
philip
reddened
feeling
his
own
spruceness
an
intolerable
reproach
for
of
late
he
had
begun
to
pay
some
attention
to
his
toilet
and
he
had
come
out
from
england
with
a
pretty
selection
of
ties
the
summer
came
upon
the
country
like
a
conqueror
each
day
was
beautiful
the
sky
had
an
arrogant
blue
which
goaded
the
nerves
like
a
spur
the
green
of
the
trees
in
the
anlage
was
violent
and
crude
and
the
houses
when
the
sun
caught
them
had
a
dazzling
white
which
stimulated
till
it
hurt
sometimes
on
his
way
back
from
wharton
philip
would
sit
in
the
shade
on
one
of
the
benches
in
the
anlage
enjoying
the
coolness
and
watching
the
patterns
of
light
which
the
sun
shining
through
the
leaves
made
on
the
ground
his
soul
danced
with
delight
as
gaily
as
the
sunbeams
he
revelled
in
those
moments
of
idleness
stolen
from
his
work
sometimes
he
sauntered
through
the
streets
of
the
old
town
he
looked
with
awe
at
the
students
of
the
corps
their
cheeks
gashed
and
red
who
swaggered
about
in
their
coloured
caps
in
the
afternoons
he
wandered
about
the
hills
with
the
girls
in
the
frau
professors
house
and
sometimes
they
went
up
the
river
and
had
tea
in
a
leafy
beergarden
in
the
evenings
they
walked
round
and
round
the
stadtgarten
listening
to
the
band
philip
soon
learned
the
various
interests
of
the
household
fraulein
thekla
the
professors
elder
daughter
was
engaged
to
a
man
in
england
who
had
spent
twelve
months
in
the
house
to
learn
german
and
their
marriage
was
to
take
place
at
the
end
of
the
year
but
the
young
man
wrote
that
his
father
an
indiarubber
merchant
who
lived
in
slough
did
not
approve
of
the
union
and
fraulein
thekla
was
often
in
tears
sometimes
she
and
her
mother
might
be
seen
with
stern
eyes
and
determined
mouths
looking
over
the
letters
of
the
reluctant
lover
thekla
painted
in
water
colour
and
occasionally
she
and
philip
with
another
of
the
girls
to
keep
them
company
would
go
out
and
paint
little
pictures
the
pretty
fraulein
hedwig
had
amorous
troubles
too
she
was
the
daughter
of
a
merchant
in
berlin
and
a
dashing
hussar
had
fallen
in
love
with
her
a
von
if
you
please
but
his
parents
opposed
a
marriage
with
a
person
of
her
condition
and
she
had
been
sent
to
heidelberg
to
forget
him
she
could
never
never
do
this
and
corresponded
with
him
continually
and
he
was
making
every
effort
to
induce
an
exasperating
father
to
change
his
mind
she
told
all
this
to
philip
with
pretty
sighs
and
becoming
blushes
and
showed
him
the
photograph
of
the
gay
lieutenant
philip
liked
her
best
of
all
the
girls
at
the
frau
professors
and
on
their
walks
always
tried
to
get
by
her
side
he
blushed
a
great
deal
when
the
others
chaffed
him
for
his
obvious
preference
he
made
the
first
declaration
in
his
life
to
fraulein
hedwig
but
unfortunately
it
was
an
accident
and
it
happened
in
this
manner
in
the
evenings
when
they
did
not
go
out
the
young
women
sang
little
songs
in
the
green
velvet
drawingroom
while
fraulein
anna
who
always
made
herself
useful
industriously
accompanied
fraulein
hedwigs
favourite
song
was
called
ich
liebe
dich
i
love
you
and
one
evening
after
she
had
sung
this
when
philip
was
standing
with
her
on
the
balcony
looking
at
the
stars
it
occurred
to
him
to
make
some
remark
about
it
he
began
ich
liebe
dich
his
german
was
halting
and
he
looked
about
for
the
word
he
wanted
the
pause
was
infinitesimal
but
before
he
could
go
on
fraulein
hedwig
said
ach
herr
carey
sie
mussen
mir
nicht
du
sagenyou
mustnt
talk
to
me
in
the
second
person
singular
philip
felt
himself
grow
hot
all
over
for
he
would
never
have
dared
to
do
anything
so
familiar
and
he
could
think
of
nothing
on
earth
to
say
it
would
be
ungallant
to
explain
that
he
was
not
making
an
observation
but
merely
mentioning
the
title
of
a
song
entschuldigen
sie
he
said
i
beg
your
pardon
it
does
not
matter
she
whispered
she
smiled
pleasantly
quietly
took
his
hand
and
pressed
it
then
turned
back
into
the
drawingroom
next
day
he
was
so
embarrassed
that
he
could
not
speak
to
her
and
in
his
shyness
did
all
that
was
possible
to
avoid
her
when
he
was
asked
to
go
for
the
usual
walk
he
refused
because
he
said
he
had
work
to
do
but
fraulein
hedwig
seized
an
opportunity
to
speak
to
him
alone
why
are
you
behaving
in
this
way
she
said
kindly
you
know
im
not
angry
with
you
for
what
you
said
last
night
you
cant
help
it
if
you
love
me
im
flattered
but
although
im
not
exactly
engaged
to
hermann
i
can
never
love
anyone
else
and
i
look
upon
myself
as
his
bride
philip
blushed
again
but
he
put
on
quite
the
expression
of
a
rejected
lover
i
hope
youll
be
very
happy

said

professor
erlin
gave
philip
a
lesson
every
day
he
made
out
a
list
of
books
which
philip
was
to
read
till
he
was
ready
for
the
final
achievement
of
faust
and
meanwhile
ingeniously
enough
started
him
on
a
german
translation
of
one
of
the
plays
by
shakespeare
which
philip
had
studied
at
school
it
was
the
period
in
germany
of
goethes
highest
fame
notwithstanding
his
rather
condescending
attitude
towards
patriotism
he
had
been
adopted
as
the
national
poet
and
seemed
since
the
war
of
seventy
to
be
one
of
the
most
significant
glories
of
national
unity
the
enthusiastic
seemed
in
the
wildness
of
the
walpurgisnacht
to
hear
the
rattle
of
artillery
at
gravelotte
but
one
mark
of
a
writers
greatness
is
that
different
minds
can
find
in
him
different
inspirations
and
professor
erlin
who
hated
the
prussians
gave
his
enthusiastic
admiration
to
goethe
because
his
works
olympian
and
sedate
offered
the
only
refuge
for
a
sane
mind
against
the
onslaughts
of
the
present
generation
there
was
a
dramatist
whose
name
of
late
had
been
much
heard
at
heidelberg
and
the
winter
before
one
of
his
plays
had
been
given
at
the
theatre
amid
the
cheers
of
adherents
and
the
hisses
of
decent
people
philip
heard
discussions
about
it
at
the
frau
professors
long
table
and
at
these
professor
erlin
lost
his
wonted
calm
he
beat
the
table
with
his
fist
and
drowned
all
opposition
with
the
roar
of
his
fine
deep
voice
it
was
nonsense
and
obscene
nonsense
he
forced
himself
to
sit
the
play
out
but
he
did
not
know
whether
he
was
more
bored
or
nauseated
if
that
was
what
the
theatre
was
coming
to
then
it
was
high
time
the
police
stepped
in
and
closed
the
playhouses
he
was
no
prude
and
could
laugh
as
well
as
anyone
at
the
witty
immorality
of
a
farce
at
the
palais
royal
but
here
was
nothing
but
filth
with
an
emphatic
gesture
he
held
his
nose
and
whistled
through
his
teeth
it
was
the
ruin
of
the
family
the
uprooting
of
morals
the
destruction
of
germany
aber
adolf
said
the
frau
professor
from
the
other
end
of
the
table
calm
yourself
he
shook
his
fist
at
her
he
was
the
mildest
of
creatures
and
ventured
upon
no
action
of
his
life
without
consulting
her

sooner
my

at

feet
than

them
listening
to
the
garbage
of
that
shameless
fellow
the
play
was
the
dolls
house
and
the
author
was
henrik
ibsen
professor
erlin
classed
him
with
richard
wagner
but
of
him
he
spoke
not
with
anger
but
with
goodhumoured
laughter
he
was
a
charlatan
but
a
successful
charlatan
and
in
that
was
always
something
for
the
comic
spirit
to
rejoice
in
verruckter

a
madman
he
said
he
had
seen
lohengrin
and
that
passed

it
was
dull
but
no
worse
but
siegfried
when
he
mentioned
it
professor
erlin
leaned
his
head
on
his
hand
and
bellowed
with
laughter
not
a
melody
in
it
from
beginning
to
end
he
could
imagine
richard
wagner
sitting
in
his
box
and
laughing
till
his
sides
ached
at
the
sight
of
all
the
people
who
were
taking
it
seriously
it
was
the
greatest
hoax
of
the
nineteenth
century
he
lifted
his
glass
of
beer
to
his
lips
threw
back
his
head
and
drank
till
the
glass
was
empty
then
wiping
his
mouth
with
the
back
of
his
hand
he
said
i
tell
you
young
people
that
before
the
nineteenth
century
is
out
wagner
will
be
as
dead
as

the
oddest
of
philips
masters
was
his
teacher
of
french
monsieur
ducroz
was
a
citizen
of
geneva
he
was
a
tall
old
man
with
a
sallow
skin
and
hollow
cheeks
his
gray
hair
was
thin
and
long
he
wore
shabby
black
clothes
with
holes
at
the
elbows
of
his
coat
and
frayed
trousers
his
linen
was
very
dirty
philip
had
never
seen
him
in
a
clean
collar
he
was
a
man
of
few
words
who
gave
his
lesson
conscientiously
but
without
enthusiasm
arriving
as
the
clock
struck
and
leaving
on
the
minute
his
charges
were
very
small
he
was
taciturn
and
what
philip
learnt
about
him
he
learnt
from
others
it
appeared
that
he
had
fought
with
gatibaldi
against
the
pope
but
had
left
italy
in
disgust
when
it
was
clear
that
all
his
efforts
for
freedom
by
which
he
meant
the
establishment
of
a
republic
tended
to
no
more
than
an
exchange
of
yokes
he
had
been
expelled
from
geneva
for
it
was
not
known
what
political
offences
philip
looked
upon
him
with
puzzled
surprise
for
he
was
very
unlike
his
idea
of
the
revolutionary
he
spoke
in
a
low
voice
and
was
extraordinarily
polite
he
never
sat
down
till
he
was
asked
to
and
when
on
rare
occasions
he
met
philip
in
the
street
took
off
his
hat
with
an
elaborate
gesture
he
never
laughed
he
never
even
smiled
a
more
complete
imagination
than
philips
might
have
pictured
a
youth
of
splendid
hope
for
he
must
have
been
entering
upon
manhood
in

when
kings
remembering
their
brother
of
france
went
about
with
an
uneasy
crick
in
theit
necks
and
perhaps
that
passion
for
liberty
which
passed
through
europe
sweeping
before
it
what
of
absolutism
and
tyranny
had
reared
its
head
during
the
reaction
from
the
revolution
of

filled
no
breast
with
a
hotter
fire
one
might
fancy
him
passionate
with
theories
of
human
equality
and
human
rights
discussing
arguing
fighting
behind
barricades
in
paris
flying
before
the
austrian
cavalry
in
milan
imprisoned
here
exiled
from
there
hoping
on
and
upborne
ever
with
the

seemed
so
magical
the
word
liberty
till
at
last
broken
with
disease
and
starvation
old
without
means
to
keep
body
and
soul
together
but
such
lessons
as
he
could
pick
up
from
poor
students
he
found
himself
in
that
little
neat
town
under
the
heel
of
a
personal
tyranny
greater
than
any
in
europe
perhaps
his
taciturnity
hid
a
contempt
for
the
human
race
which
had
abandoned
the
great
dreams
of
his
youth
and
now
wallowed
in
sluggish
ease
or
perhaps
these
thirty
years
of
revolution
had
taught
him
that
men
are
unfit
for
liberty
and
he
thought
that
he
had
spent
his
life
in
the
pursuit
of
that
which
was
not
worth
the
finding
or
maybe
he
was
tired
out
and
waited
only
with
indifference
for
the
release
of
death
one
day
philip
with
the
bluntness
of
his
age
asked
him
if
it
was
true
he
had
been
with
garibaldi
the
old
man
did
not
seem
to
attach
any
importance
to
the
question
he
answered
quite
quietly
in
as
low
a
voice
as
usual
oui
monsieur
they
say
you
were
in
the
commune
do
they
shall
we
get
on
with
our
work
he
held
the
book
open
and
philip
intimidated
began
to
translate
the
passage
he
had
prepared
one
day
monsieur
ducroz
seemed
to
be
in
great
pain
he
had
been
scarcely
able
to
drag
himself
up
the
many
stairs
to
philips
room
and
when
he
arrived
sat
down
heavily
his
sallow
face
drawn
with
beads
of
sweat
on
his
forehead
trying
to
recover
himself
im
afraid
youre
ill
said
philip
its
of
no
consequence
but
philip
saw
that
he
was
suffering
and
at
the
end
of
the
hour
asked
whether
he
would
not
prefer
to
give
no
more
lessons
till
he
was
better
no
said
the
old
man
in
his
even
low
voice
i
prefer
to
go
on
while
i
am
able
philip
morbidly
nervous
when
he
had
to
make
any
reference
to
money
reddened
but
it
wont
make
any
difference
to
you
he
said
ill
pay
for
the
lessons
just
the
same
if
you
wouldnt
mind
id
like
to
give
you
the
money
for
next
week
in
advance
monsieur
ducroz
charged
eighteen
pence
an
hour
philip
took
a
tenmark
piece
out
of
his
pocket
and
shyly
put
it
on
the
table
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
offer
it
as
if
the
old
man
were
a
beggar
in
that
case
i
think
i
wont
come
again
till
im
better
he
took
the
coin
and
without
anything
more
than
the
elaborate
bow
with
which
he
always
took
his
leave
went
out
bonjour
monsieur
philip
was
vaguely
disappointed
thinking
he
had
done
a
generous
thing
he
had
expected
that
monsieur
ducroz
would
overwhelm
him
with
expressions
of
gratitude
he
was
taken
aback
to
find
that
the
old
teacher
accepted
the
present
as
though
it
were
his
due
he
was
so
young
he
did
not
realise
how
much
less
is
the
sense
of
obligation
in
those
who
receive
favours
than
in
those
who
grant
them
monsieur
ducroz
appeared
again
five
or
six
days
later
he
tottered
a
little
more
and
was
very
weak
but
seemed
to
have
overcome
the
severity
of
the
attack
he
was
no
more
communicative
than
he
had
been
before
he
remained
mysterious
aloof
and
dirty
he
made
no
reference
to
his
illness
till
after
the
lesson
and
then
just
as
he
was
leaving
at
the
door
which
he
held
open
he
paused
he
hesitated
as
though
to
speak
were
difficult
if
it
hadnt
been
for
the
money
you
gave
me
i
should
have
starved
it
was
all
i
had
to
live
on
he
made
his
solemn
obsequious
bow
and
went
out
philip
felt
a
little
lump
in
his
throat
he
seemed
to
realise
in
a
fashion
the
hopeless
bitterness
of
the
old
mans
struggle
and
how
hard
life
was
for
him
when
to
himself
it
was
so
pleasant
chapter
xxvi
philip
had
spent
three
months
in
heidelberg
when
one
morning
the
frau
professor
told
him
that
an
englishman
named
hayward
was
coming
to
stay
in
the
house
and
the
same
evening
at
supper
he
saw
a
new
face
for
some
days
the
family
had
lived
in
a
state
of
excitement
first
as
the
result
of
heaven
knows
what
scheming
by
dint
of
humble
prayers
and
veiled
threats
the
parents
of
the
young
englishman
to
whom
fraulein
thekla
was
engaged
had
invited
her
to
visit
them
in
england
and
she
had
set
off
with
an
album
of
water
colours
to
show
how
accomplished
she
was
and
a
bundle
of
letters
to
prove
how
deeply
the
young
man
had
compromised
himself
a
week
later
fraulein
hedwig
with
radiant
smiles
announced
that
the
lieutenant
of
her
affections
was
coming
to
heidelberg
with
his
father
and
mother
exhausted
by
the
importunity
of
their
son
and
touched
by
the
dowry
which
fraulein
hedwigs
father
offered
the
lieutenants
parents
had
consented
to
pass
through
heidelberg
to
make
the
young
womans
acquaintance
the
interview
was
satisfactory
and
fraulein
hedwig
had
the
satisfaction
of
showing
her
lover
in
the
stadtgarten
to
the
whole
of
frau
professor
erlins
household
the
silent
old
ladies
who
sat
at
the
top
of
the
table
near
the
frau
professor
were
in
a
flutter
and
when
fraulein
hedwig
said
she
was
to
go
home
at
once
for
the
formal
engagement
to
take
place
the
frau
professor
regardless
of
expense
said
she
would
give
a
maibowle
professor
erlin
prided
himself
on
his
skill
in
preparing
this
mild
intoxicant
and
after
supper
the
large
bowl
of
hock
and
soda
with
scented
herbs
floating
in
it
and
wild
strawberries
was
placed
with
solemnity
on
the
round
table
in
the
drawingroom
fraulein
anna
teased
philip
about
the
departure
of
his
ladylove
and
he
felt
very
uncomfortable
and
rather
melancholy
fraulein
hedwig
sang
several
songs
fraulein
anna
played
the
wedding
march
and
the
professor
sang
die
wacht
am
rhein
amid
all
this
jollification
philip
paid
little
attention
to
the
new
arrival
they
had
sat
opposite
one
another
at
supper
but
philip
was
chattering
busily
with
fraulein
hedwig
and
the
stranger
knowing
no
german
had
eaten
his
food
in
silence
philip
observing
that
he
wore
a
pale
blue
tie
had
on
that
account
taken
a
sudden
dislike
to
him
he
was
a
man
of
twentysix
very
fair
with
long
wavy
hair
through
which
he
passed
his
hand
frequently
with
a
careless
gesture
his
eyes
were
large
and
blue
but
the
blue
was
very
pale
and
they
looked
rather
tired
already
he
was
cleanshaven
and
his
mouth
notwithstanding
its
thin
lips
was
wellshaped
fraulein
anna
took
an
interest
in
physiognomy
and
she
made
philip
notice
afterwards
how
finely
shaped
was
his
skull
and
how
weak
was
the
lower
part
of
his
face
the
head
she
remarked
was
the
head
of
a
thinker
but
the
jaw
lacked
character
fraulein
anna
foredoomed
to
a
spinsters
life
with
her
high
cheekbones
and
large
misshapen
nose
laid
great
stress
upon
character
while
they
talked
of
him
he
stood
a
little
apart
from
the
others
watching
the
noisy
party
with
a
goodhumoured
but
faintly
supercilious
expression
he
was
tall
and
slim
he
held
himself
with
a
deliberate
grace
weeks
one
of
the
american
students
seeing
him
alone
went
up
and
began
to
talk
to
him
the
pair
were
oddly
contrasted
the
american
very
neat
in
his
black
coat
and
pepperandsalt
trousers
thin
and
driedup
with
something
of
ecclesiastical
unction
already
in
his
manner
and
the
englishman
in
his
loose
tweed
suit
largelimbed
and
slow
of
gesture
philip
did
not
speak
to
the
newcomer
till
next
day
they
found
themselves
alone
on
the
balcony
of
the
drawingroom
before
dinner
hayward
addressed
him
youre
english
arent
you
yes
is
the
food
always
as
bad
it
was
last
night
its
always
about
the
same
beastly
isnt
it
beastly
philip
had
found
nothing
wrong
with
the
food
at
all
and
in
fact
had
eaten
it
in
large
quantities
with
appetite
and
enjoyment
but
he
did
not
want
to
show
himself
a
person
of
so
little
discrimination
as
to
think
a
dinner
good
which
another
thought
execrable
fraulein
theklas
visit
to
england
made
it
necessary
for
her
sister
to
do
more
in
the
house
and
she
could
not
often
spare
the
time
for
long
walks
and
fraulein
cacilie
with
her
long
plait
of
fair
hair
and
her
little
snubnosed
face
had
of
late
shown
a
certain
disinclination
for
society
fraulein
hedwig
was
gone
and
weeks
the
american
who
generally
accompanied
them
on
their
rambles
had
set
out
for
a
tour
of
south
germany
philip
was
left
a
good
deal
to
himself
hayward
sought
his
acquaintance
but
philip
had
an
unfortunate
trait
from
shyness
or
from
some
atavistic
inheritance
of
the
cavedweller
he
always
disliked
people
on
first
acquaintance
and
it
was
not
till
he
became
used
to
them
that
he
got
over
his
first
impression
it
made
him
difficult
of
access
he
received
haywards
advances
very
shyly
and
when
hayward
asked
him
one
day
to
go
for
a
walk
he
accepted
only
because
he
could
not
think
of
a
civil
excuse
he
made
his
usual
apology
angry
with
himself
for
the
flushing
cheeks
he
could
not
control
and
trying
to
carry
it
off
with
a
laugh
im
afraid
i
cant
walk
very
fast
good
heavens
i
dont
walk
for
a
wager
i
prefer
to
stroll
dont
you
remember
the
chapter
in
marius
where
pater
talks
of
the
gentle
exercise
of
walking
as
the
best
incentive
to
conversation
philip
was
a
good
listener
though
he
often
thought
of
clever
things
to
say
it
was
seldom
till
after
the
opportunity
to
say
them
had
passed
but
hayward
was
communicative
anyone
more
experienced
than
philip
might
have
thought
he
liked
to
hear
himself
talk
his
supercilious
attitude
impressed
philip
he
could
not
help
admiring
and
yet
being
awed
by
a
man
who
faintly
despised
so
many
things
which
philip
had
looked
upon
as
almost
sacred
he
cast
down
the
fetish
of
exercise
damning
with
the
contemptuous
word
pothunters
all
those
who
devoted
themselves
to
its
various
forms
and
philip
did
not
realise
that
he
was
merely
putting
up
in
its
stead
the
other
fetish
of
culture
they
wandered
up
to
the
castle
and
sat
on
the
terrace
that
overlooked
the
town
it
nestled
in
the
valley
along
the
pleasant
neckar
with
a
comfortable
friendliness
the
smoke
from
the
chimneys
hung
over
it
a
pale
blue
haze
and
the
tall
roofs
the
spires
of
the
churches
gave
it
a
pleasantly
medieval
air
there
was
a
homeliness
in
it
which
warmed
the
heart
hayward
talked
of
richard
feverel
and
madame
bovary
of
verlaine
dante
and
matthew
arnold
in
those
days
fitzgeralds
translation
of
omar
khayyam
was
known
only
to
the
elect
and
hayward
repeated
it
to
philip
he
was
very
fond
of
reciting
poetry
his
own
and
that
of
others
which
he
did
in
a
monotonous
singsong
by
the
time
they
reached
home
philips
distrust
of
hayward
was
changed
to
enthusiastic
admiration
they
made
a
practice
of
walking
together
every
afternoon
and
philip
learned
presently
something
of
haywards
circumstances
he
was
the
son
of
a
country
judge
on
whose
death
some
time
before
he
had
inherited
three
hundred
a
year
his
record
at
charterhouse
was
so
brilliant
that
when
he
went
to
cambridge
the
master
of
trinity
hall
went
out
of
his
way
to
express
his
satisfaction
that
he
was
going
to
that
college
he
prepared
himself
for
a
distinguished
career
he
moved
in
the
most
intellectual
circles
he
read
browning
with
enthusiasm
and
turned
up
his
wellshaped
nose
at
tennyson
he
knew
all
the
details
of
shelleys
treatment
of
harriet
he
dabbled
in
the
history
of
art
on
the
walls
of
his
rooms
were
reproductions
of
pictures
by
g
f
watts
burnejones
and
botticelli
and
he
wrote
not
without
distinction
verses
of
a
pessimistic
character
his
friends
told
one
another
that
he
was
a
man
of
excellent
gifts
and
he
listened
to
them
willingly
when
they
prophesied
his
future
eminence
in
course
of
time
he
became
an
authority
on
art
and
literature
he
came
under
the
influence
of
newmans
apologia
the
picturesqueness
of
the
roman
catholic
faith
appealed
to
his
esthetic
sensibility
and
it
was
only
the
feat
of
his
fathers
wrath
a
plain
blunt
man
of
narrow
ideas
who
read
macaulay
which
prevented
him
from
going
over
when
he
only
got
a
pass
degree
his
friends
were
astonished
but
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
delicately
insinuated
that
he
was
not
the
dupe
of
examiners
he
made
one
feel
that
a
first
class
was
ever
so
slightly
vulgar
he
described
one
of
the
vivas
with
tolerant
humour
some
fellow
in
an
outrageous
collar
was
asking
him
questions
in
logic
it
was
infinitely
tedious
and
suddenly
he
noticed
that
he
wore
elasticsided
boots
it
was
grotesque
and
ridiculous
so
he
withdrew
his
mind
and
thought
of
the
gothic
beauty
of
the
chapel
at
kings
but
he
had
spent
some
delightful
days
at
cambridge
he
had
given
better
dinners
than
anyone
he
knew
and
the
conversation
in
his
rooms
had
been
often
memorable
he
quoted
to
philip
the
exquisite
epigram
they
told
me
herakleitus
they
told
me
you
were
dead
and
now
when
he
related
again
the
picturesque
little
anecdote
about
the
examiner
and
his
boots
he
laughed
of
course
it
was
folly
he
said
but
it
was
a
folly
in
which
there
was
something
fine
philip
with
a
little
thrill
thought
it
magnificent
then
hayward
went
to
london
to
read
for
the
bar
he
had
charming
rooms
in
clements
inn
with
panelled
walls
and
he
tried
to
make
them
look
like
his
old
rooms
at
the
hall
he
had
ambitions
that
were
vaguely
political
he
described
himself
as
a
whig
and
he
was
put
up
for
a
club
which
was
of
liberal
but
gentlemanly
flavour
his
idea
was
to
practise
at
the
bar
he
chose
the
chancery
side
as
less
brutal
and
get
a
seat
for
some
pleasant
constituency
as
soon
as
the
various
promises
made
him
were
carried
out
meanwhile
he
went
a
great
deal
to
the
opera
and
made
acquaintance
with
a
small
number
of
charming
people
who
admired
the
things
that
he
admired
he
joined
a
diningclub
of
which
the
motto
was
the
whole
the
good
and
the
beautiful
he
formed
a
platonic
friendship
with
a
lady
some
years
older
than
himself
who
lived
in
kensington
square
and
nearly
every
afternoon
he
drank
tea
with
her
by
the
light
of
shaded
candles
and
talked
of
george
meredith
and
walter
pater
it
was
notorious
that
any
fool
could
pass
the
examinations
of
the
bar
council
and
he
pursued
his
studies
in
a
dilatory
fashion
when
he
was
ploughed
for
his
final
he
looked
upon
it
as
a
personal
affront
at
the
same
time
the
lady
in
kensington
square
told
him
that
her
husband
was
coming
home
from
india
on
leave
and
was
a
man
though
worthy
in
every
way
of
a
commonplace
mind
who
would
not
understand
a
young
mans
frequent
visits
hayward
felt
that
life
was
full
of
ugliness
his
soul
revolted
from
the
thought
of
affronting
again
the
cynicism
of
examiners
and
he
saw
something
rather
splendid
in
kicking
away
the
ball
which
lay
at
his
feet
he
was
also
a
good
deal
in
debt
it
was
difficult
to
live
in
london
like
a
gentleman
on
three
hundred
a
year
and
his
heart
yearned
for
the
venice
and
florence
which
john
ruskin
had
so
magically
described
he
felt
that
he
was
unsuited
to
the
vulgar
bustle
of
the
bar
for
he
had
discovered
that
it
was
not
sufficient
to
put
your
name
on
a
door
to
get
briefs
and
modern
politics
seemed
to
lack
nobility
he
felt
himself
a
poet
he
disposed
of
his
rooms
in
clements
inn
and
went
to
italy
he
had
spent
a
winter
in
florence
and
a
winter
in
rome
and
now
was
passing
his
second
summer
abroad
in
germany
so
that
he
might
read
goethe
in
the
original
hayward
had
one
gift
which
was
very
precious
he
had
a
real
feeling
for
literature
and
he
could
impart
his
own
passion
with
an
admirable
fluency
he
could
throw
himself
into
sympathy
with
a
writer
and
see
all
that
was
best
in
him
and
then
he
could
talk
about
him
with
understanding
philip
had
read
a
great
deal
but
he
had
read
without
discrimination
everything
that
he
happened
to
come
across
and
it
was
very
good
for
him
now
to
meet
someone
who
could
guide
his
taste
he
borrowed
books
from
the
small
lending
library
which
the
town
possessed
and
began
reading
all
the
wonderful
things
that
hayward
spoke
of
he
did
not
read
always
with
enjoyment
but
invariably
with
perseverance
he
was
eager
for
selfimprovement
he
felt
himself
very
ignorant
and
very
humble
by
the
end
of
august
when
weeks
returned
from
south
germany
philip
was
completely
under
haywards
influence
hayward
did
not
like
weeks
he
deplored
the
americans
black
coat
and
pepperandsalt
trousers
and
spoke
with
a
scornful
shrug
of
his
new
england
conscience
philip
listened
complacently
to
the
abuse
of
a
man
who
had
gone
out
of
his
way
to
be
kind
to
him
but
when
weeks
in
his
turn
made
disagreeable
remarks
about
hayward
he
lost
his
temper
your
new
friend
looks
like
a
poet
said
weeks
with
a
thin
smile
on
his
careworn
bitter
mouth
he
is
a
poet
did
he
tell
you
so
in
america
we
should
call
him
a
pretty
fair
specimen
of
a
waster
well
were
not
in
america
said
philip
frigidly
how
old
is
he
twentyfive
and
he
does
nothing
but
stay
in
pensions
and
write
poetry
you
dont
know
him
said
philip
hotly
oh
yes
i
do
ive
met
a
hundred
and
fortyseven
of
him
weeks
eyes
twinkled
but
philip
who
did
not
understand
american
humour
pursed
his
lips
and
looked
severe
weeks
to
philip
seemed
a
man
of
middle
age
but
he
was
in
point
of
fact
little
more
than
thirty
he
had
a
long
thin
body
and
the
scholars
stoop
his
head
was
large
and
ugly
he
had
pale
scanty
hair
and
an
earthy
skin
his
thin
mouth
and
thin
long
nose
and
the
great
protuberance
of
his
frontal
bones
gave
him
an
uncouth
look
he
was
cold
and
precise
in
his
manner
a
bloodless
man
without
passion
but
he
had
a
curious
vein
of
frivolity
which
disconcerted
the
seriousminded
among
whom
his
instincts
naturally
threw
him
he
was
studying
theology
in
heidelberg
but
the
other
theological
students
of
his
own
nationality
looked
upon
him
with
suspicion
he
was
very
unorthodox
which
frightened
them
and
his
freakish
humour
excited
their
disapproval
how
can
you
have
known
a
hundred
and
fortyseven
of
him
asked
philip
seriously
ive
met
him
in
the
latin
quarter
in
paris
and
ive
met
him
in
pensions
in
berlin
and
munich
he
lives
in
small
hotels
in
perugia
and
assisi
he
stands
by
the
dozen
before
the
botticellis
in
florence
and
he
sits
on
all
the
benches
of
the
sistine
chapel
in
rome
in
italy
he
drinks
a
little
too
much
wine
and
in
germany
he
drinks
a
great
deal
too
much
beer
he
always
admires
the
right
thing
whatever
the
right
thing
is
and
one
of
these
days
hes
going
to
write
a
great
work
think
of
it
there
are
a
hundred
and
fortyseven
great
works
reposing
in
the
bosoms
of
a
hundred
and
fortyseven
great
men
and
the
tragic
thing
is
that
not
one
of
those
hundred
and
fortyseven
great
works
will
ever
be
written
and
yet
the
world
goes
on
weeks
spoke
seriously
but
his
gray
eyes
twinkled
a
little
at
the
end
of
his
long
speech
and
philip
flushed
when
he
saw
that
the
american
was
making
fun
of
him
you
do
talk
rot
he
said
crossly
chapter
xxvii
weeks
had
two
little
rooms
at
the
back
of
frau
erlins
house
and
one
of
them
arranged
as
a
parlour
was
comfortable
enough
for
him
to
invite
people
to
sit
in
after
supper
urged
perhaps
by
the
impish
humour
which
was
the
despair
of
his
friends
in
cambridge
mass
he
often
asked
philip
and
hayward
to
come
in
for
a
chat
he
received
them
with
elaborate
courtesy
and
insisted
on
their
sitting
in
the
only
two
comfortable
chairs
in
the
room
though
he
did
not
drink
himself
with
a
politeness
of
which
philip
recognised
the
irony
he
put
a
couple
of
bottles
of
beer
at
haywards
elbow
and
he
insisted
on
lighting
matches
whenever
in
the
heat
of
argument
haywards
pipe
went
out
at
the
beginning
of
their
acquaintance
hayward
as
a
member
of
so
celebrated
a
university
had
adopted
a
patronising
attitude
towards
weeks
who
was
a
graduate
of
harvard
and
when
by
chance
the
conversation
turned
upon
the
greek
tragedians
a
subject
upon
which
hayward
felt
he
spoke
with
authority
he
had
assumed
the
air
that
it
was
his
part
to
give
information
rather
than
to
exchange
ideas
weeks
had
listened
politely
with
smiling
modesty
till
hayward
finished
then
he
asked
one
or
two
insidious
questions
so
innocent
in
appearance
that
hayward
not
seeing
into
what
a
quandary
they
led
him
answered
blandly
weeks
made
a
courteous
objection
then
a
correction
of
fact
after
that
a
quotation
from
some
little
known
latin
commentator
then
a
reference
to
a
german
authority
and
the
fact
was
disclosed
that
he
was
a
scholar
with
smiling
ease
apologetically
weeks
tore
to
pieces
all
that
hayward
had
said
with
elaborate
civility
he
displayed
the
superficiality
of
his
attainments
he
mocked
him
with
gentle
irony
philip
could
not
help
seeing
that
hayward
looked
a
perfect
fool
and
hayward
had
not
the
sense
to
hold
his
tongue
in
his
irritation
his
selfassurance
undaunted
he
attempted
to
argue
he
made
wild
statements
and
weeks
amicably
corrected
them
he
reasoned
falsely
and
weeks
proved
that
he
was
absurd
weeks
confessed
that
he
had
taught
greek
literature
at
harvard
hayward
gave
a
laugh
of
scorn
i
might
have
known
it
of
course
you
read
greek
like
a
schoolmaster
he
said
i
read
it
like
a
poet
and
do
you
find
it
more
poetic
when
you
dont
quite
know
what
it
means
i
thought
it
was
only
in
revealed
religion
that
a
mistranslation
improved
the
sense
at
last
having
finished
the
beer
hayward
left
weeks
room
hot
and
dishevelled
with
an
angry
gesture
he
said
to
philip
of
course
the
mans
a
pedant
he
has
no
real
feeling
for
beauty
accuracy
is
the
virtue
of
clerks
its
the
spirit
of
the
greeks
that
we
aim
at
weeks
is
like
that
fellow
who
went
to
hear
rubenstein
and
complained
that
he
played
false
notes
false
notes
what
did
they
matter
when
he
played
divinely
philip
not
knowing
how
many
incompetent
people
have
found
solace
in
these
false
notes
was
much
impressed
hayward
could
never
resist
the
opportunity
which
weeks
offered
him
of
regaining
ground
lost
on
a
previous
occasion
and
weeks
was
able
with
the
greatest
ease
to
draw
him
into
a
discussion
though
he
could
not
help
seeing
how
small
his
attainments
were
beside
the
americans
his
british
pertinacity
his
wounded
vanity
perhaps
they
are
the
same
thing
would
not
allow
him
to
give
up
the
struggle
hayward
seemed
to
take
a
delight
in
displaying
his
ignorance
selfsatisfaction
and
wrongheadedness
whenever
hayward
said
something
which
was
illogical
weeks
in
a
few
words
would
show
the
falseness
of
his
reasoning
pause
for
a
moment
to
enjoy
his
triumph
and
then
hurry
on
to
another
subject
as
though
christian
charity
impelled
him
to
spare
the
vanquished
foe
philip
tried
sometimes
to
put
in
something
to
help
his
friend
and
weeks
gently
crushed
him
but
so
kindly
differently
from
the
way
in
which
he
answered
hayward
that
even
philip
outrageously
sensitive
could
not
feel
hurt
now
and
then
losing
his
calm
as
he
felt
himself
more
and
more
foolish
hayward
became
abusive
and
only
the
americans
smiling
politeness
prevented
the
argument
from
degenerating
into
a
quarrel
on
these
occasions
when
hayward
left
weeks
room
he
muttered
angrily
damned
yankee
that
settled
it
it
was
a
perfect
answer
to
an
argument
which
had
seemed
unanswerable
though
they
began
by
discussing
all
manner
of
subjects
in
weeks
little
room
eventually
the
conversation
always
turned
to
religion
the
theological
student
took
a
professional
interest
in
it
and
hayward
welcomed
a
subject
in
which
hard
facts
need
not
disconcert
him
when
feeling
is
the
gauge
you
can
snap
your
angers
at
logic
and
when
your
logic
is
weak
that
is
very
agreeable
hayward
found
it
difficult
to
explain
his
beliefs
to
philip
without
a
great
flow
of
words
but
it
was
clear
and
this
fell
in
with
philips
idea
of
the
natural
order
of
things
that
he
had
been
brought
up
in
the
church
by
law
established
though
he
had
now
given
up
all
idea
of
becoming
a
roman
catholic
he
still
looked
upon
that
communion
with
sympathy
he
had
much
to
say
in
its
praise
and
he
compared
favourably
its
gorgeous
ceremonies
with
the
simple
services
of
the
church
of
england
he
gave
philip
newmans
apologia
to
read
and
philip
finding
it
very
dull
nevertheless
read
it
to
the
end
read
it
for
its
style
not
for
its
matter
said
hayward
he
talked
enthusiastically
of
the
music
at
the
oratory
and
said
charming
things
about
the
connection
between
incense
and
the
devotional
spirit
weeks
listened
to
him
with
his
frigid
smile
you
think
it
proves
the
truth
of
roman
catholicism
that
john
henry
newman
wrote
good
english
and
that
cardinal
manning
has
a
picturesque
appearance
hayward
hinted
that
he
had
gone
through
much
trouble
with
his
soul
for
a
year
he
had
swum
in
a
sea
of
darkness
he
passed
his
fingers
through
his
fair
waving
hair
and
told
them
that
he
would
not
for
five
hundred
pounds
endure
again
those
agonies
of
mind
fortunately
he
had
reached
calm
waters
at
last
but
what
do
you
believe
asked
philip
who
was
never
satisfied
with
vague
statements
i
believe
in
the
whole
the
good
and
the
beautiful
hayward
with
his
loose
large
limbs
and
the
fine
carriage
of
his
head
looked
very
handsome
when
he
said
this
and
he
said
it
with
an
air
is
that
how
you
would
describe
your
religion
in
a
census
paper
asked
weeks
in
mild
tones
i
hate
the
rigid
definition
its
so
ugly
so
obvious
if
you
like
i
will
say
that
i
believe
in
the
church
of
the
duke
of
wellington
and
mr
gladstone
thats
the
church
of
england
said
philip
oh
wise
young
man
retorted
hayward
with
a
smile
which
made
philip
blush
for
he
felt
that
in
putting
into
plain
words
what
the
other
had
expressed
in
a
paraphrase
he
had
been
guilty
of
vulgarity
i
belong
to
the
church
of
england
but
i
love
the
gold
and
the
silk
which
clothe
the
priest
of
rome
and
his
celibacy
and
the
confessional
and
purgatory
and
in
the
darkness
of
an
italian
cathedral
incenseladen
and
mysterious
i
believe
with
all
my
heart
in
the
miracle
of
the
mass
in
venice
i
have
seen
a
fisherwoman
come
in
barefoot
throw
down
her
basket
of
fish
by
her
side
fall
on
her
knees
and
pray
to
the
madonna
and
that
i
felt
was
the
real
faith
and
i
prayed
and
believed
with
her
but
i
believe
also
in
aphrodite
and
apollo
and
the
great
god
pan
he
had
a
charming
voice
and
he
chose
his
words
as
he
spoke
he
uttered
them
almost
rhythmically
he
would
have
gone
on
but
weeks
opened
a
second
bottle
of
beer
let
me
give
you
something
to
drink
hayward
turned
to
philip
with
the
slightly
condescending
gesture
which
so
impressed
the
youth
now
are
you
satisfied
he
asked
philip
somewhat
bewildered
confessed
that
he
was
im
disappointed
that
you
didnt
add
a
little
buddhism
said
weeks
and
i
confess
i
have
a
sort
of
sympathy
for
mahomet
i
regret
that
you
should
have
left
him
out
in
the
cold
hayward
laughed
for
he
was
in
a
good
humour
with
himself
that
evening
and
the
ring
of
his
sentences
still
sounded
pleasant
in
his
ears
he
emptied
his
glass
i
didnt
expect
you
to
understand
me
he
answered
with
your
cold
american
intelligence
you
can
only
adopt
the
critical
attitude
emerson
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
but
what
is
criticism
criticism
is
purely
destructive
anyone
can
destroy
but
not
everyone
can
build
up
you
are
a
pedant
my
dear
fellow
the
important
thing
is
to
construct
i
am
constructive
i
am
a
poet
weeks
looked
at
him
with
eyes
which
seemed
at
the
same
time
to
be
quite
grave
and
yet
to
be
smiling
brightly
i
think
if
you
dont
mind
my
saying
so
youre
a
little
drunk
nothing
to
speak
of
answered
hayward
cheerfully
and
not
enough
for
me
to
be
unable
to
overwhelm
you
in
argument
but
come
i
have
unbosomed
my
soul
now
tell
us
what
your
religion
is
weeks
put
his
head
on
one
side
so
that
he
looked
like
a
sparrow
on
a
perch
ive
been
trying
to
find
that
out
for
years
i
think
im
a
unitarian
but
thats
a
dissenter
said
philip
he
could
not
imagine
why
they
both
burst
into
laughter
hayward
uproariously
and
weeks
with
a
funny
chuckle
and
in
england
dissenters
arent
gentlemen
are
they
asked
weeks
well
if
you
ask
me
pointblank
theyre
not
replied
philip
rather
crossly
he
hated
being
laughed
at
and
they
laughed
again
and
will
you
tell
me
what
a
gentleman
is
asked
weeks
oh
i
dont
know
everyone
knows
what
it
is
are
you
a
gentleman
no
doubt
had
ever
crossed
philips
mind
on
the
subject
but
he
knew
it
was
not
a
thing
to
state
of
oneself
if
a
man
tells
you
hes
a
gentleman
you
can
bet
your
boots
he
isnt
he
retorted
am
i
a
gentleman
philips
truthfulness
made
it
difficult
for
him
to
answer
but
he
was
naturally
polite
oh
well
youre
different
he
said
youre
american
arent
you
i
suppose
we
may
take
it
that
only
englishmen
are
gentlemen
said
weeks
gravely
philip
did
not
contradict
him
couldnt
you
give
me
a
few
more
particulars
asked
weeks
philip
reddened
but
growing
angry
did
not
care
if
he
made
himself
ridiculous
i
can
give
you
plenty
he
remembered
his
uncles
saying
that
it
took
three
generations
to
make
a
gentleman
it
was
a
companion
proverb
to
the
silk
purse
and
the
sows
ear
first
of
all
hes
the
son
of
a
gentleman
and
hes
been
to
a
public
school
and
to
oxford
or
cambridge
edinburgh
wouldnt
do
i
suppose
asked
weeks
and
he
talks
english
like
a
gentleman
and
he
wears
the
right
sort
of
things
and
if
hes
a
gentleman
he
can
always
tell
if
another
chaps
a
gentleman
it
seemed
rather
lame
to
philip
as
he
went
on
but
there
it
was
that
was
what
he
meant
by
the
word
and
everyone
he
had
ever
known
had
meant
that
too
it
is
evident
to
me
that
i
am
not
a
gentleman
said
weeks
i
dont
see
why
you
should
have
been
so
surprised
because
i
was
a
dissenter
i
dont
quite
know
what
a
unitarian
is
said
philip
weeks
in
his
odd
way
again
put
his
head
on
one
side
you
almost
expected
him
to
twitter
a
unitarian
very
earnestly
disbelieves
in
almost
everything
that
anybody
else
believes
and
he
has
a
very
lively
sustaining
faith
in
he
doesnt
quite
know
what
i
dont
see
why
you
should
make
fun
of
me
said
philip
i
really
want
to
know
my
dear
friend
im
not
making
fun
of
you
i
have
arrived
at
that
definition
after
years
of
great
labour
and
the
most
anxious
nerveracking
study
when
philip
and
hayward
got
up
to
go
weeks
handed
philip
a
little
book
in
a
paper
cover
i
suppose
you
can
read
french
pretty
well
by
now
i
wonder
if
this
would
amuse
you
philip
thanked
him
and
taking
the
book
looked
at
the
title
it
was
renans

xxviii
it
occurred
neither
to
hayward
nor
to
weeks
that
the
conversations
which
helped
them
to
pass
an
idle
evening
were
being
turned
over
afterwards
in
philips
active
brain
it
had
never
struck
him
before
that
religion
was
a
matter
upon
which
discussion
was
possible
to
him
it
meant
the
church
of
england
and
not
to
believe
in
its
tenets
was
a
sign
of
wilfulness
which
could
not
fail
of
punishment
here
or
hereafter
there
was
some
doubt
in
his
mind
about
the
chastisement
of
unbelievers
it
was
possible
that
a
merciful
judge
reserving
the
flames
of
hell
for
the
heathenmahommedans
buddhists
and
the
restwould
spare
dissenters
and
roman
catholics
though
at
the
cost
of
how
much
humiliation
when
they
were
made
to
realise
their
error
and
it
was
also
possible
that
he
would
be
pitiful
to
those
who
had
had
no
chance
of
learning
the
truththis
was
reasonable
enough
though
such
were
the
activities
of
the
missionary
society
there
could
not
be
many
in
this
conditionbut
if
the
chance
had
been
theirs
and
they
had
neglected
it
in
which
category
were
obviously
roman
catholics
and
dissenters
the
punishment
was
sure
and
merited
it
was
clear
that
the
miscreant
was
in
a
parlous
state
perhaps
philip
had
not
been
taught
it
in
so
many
words
but
certainly
the
impression
had
been
given
him
that
only
members
of
the
church
of
england
had
any
real
hope
of
eternal
happiness
one
of
the
things
that
philip
had
heard
definitely
stated
was
that
the
unbeliever
was
a
wicked
and
a
vicious
man
but
weeks
though
he
believed
in
hardly
anything
that
philip
believed
led
a
life
of
christian
purity
philip
had
received
little
kindness
in
his
life
and
he
was
touched
by
the
americans
desire
to
help
him
once
when
a
cold
kept
him
in
bed
for
three
days
weeks
nursed
him
like
a
mother
there
was
neither
vice
nor
wickedness
in
him
but
only
sincerity
and
lovingkindness
it
was
evidently
possible
to
be
virtuous
and
unbelieving
also
philip
had
been
given
to
understand
that
people
adhered
to
other
faiths
only
from
obstinacy
or
selfinterest
in
their
hearts
they
knew
they
were
false
they
deliberately
sought
to
deceive
others
now
for
the
sake
of
his
german
he
had
been
accustomed
on
sunday
mornings
to
attend
the
lutheran
service
but
when
hayward
arrived
he
began
instead
to
go
with
him
to
mass
he
noticed
that
whereas
the
protestant
church
was
nearly
empty
and
the
congregation
had
a
listless
air
the
jesuit
on
the
other
hand
was
crowded
and
the
worshippers
seemed
to
pray
with
all
their
hearts
they
had
not
the
look
of
hypocrites
he
was
surprised
at
the
contrast
for
he
knew
of
course
that
the
lutherans
whose
faith
was
closer
to
that
of
the
church
of
england
on
that
account
were
nearer
the
truth
than
the
roman
catholics
most
of
the
menit
was
largely
a
masculine
congregationwere
south
germans
and
he
could
not
help
saying
to
himself
that
if
he
had
been
born
in
south
germany
he
would
certainly
have
been
a
roman
catholic
he
might
just
as
well
have
been
born
in
a
roman
catholic
country
as
in
england
and
in
england
as
well
in
a
wesleyan
baptist
or
methodist
family
as
in
one
that
fortunately
belonged
to
the
church
by
law
established
he
was
a
little
breathless
at
the
danger
he
had
run
philip
was
on
friendly
terms
with
the
little
chinaman
who
sat
at
table
with
him
twice
each
day
his
name
was
sung
he
was
always
smiling
affable
and
polite
it
seemed
strange
that
he
should
frizzle
in
hell
merely
because
he
was
a
chinaman
but
if
salvation
was
possible
whatever
a
mans
faith
was
there
did
not
seem
to
be
any
particular
advantage
in
belonging
to
the
church
of
england
philip
more
puzzled
than
he
had
ever
been
in
his
life
sounded
weeks
he
had
to
be
careful
for
he
was
very
sensitive
to
ridicule
and
the
acidulous
humour
with
which
the
american
treated
the
church
of
england
disconcerted
him
weeks
only
puzzled
him
more
he
made
philip
acknowledge
that
those
south
germans
whom
he
saw
in
the
jesuit
church
were
every
bit
as
firmly
convinced
of
the
truth
of
roman
catholicism
as
he
was
of
that
of
the
church
of
england
and
from
that
he
led
him
to
admit
that
the
mahommedan
and
the
buddhist
were
convinced
also
of
the
truth
of
their
respective
religions
it
looked
as
though
knowing
that
you
were
right
meant
nothing
they
all
knew
they
were
right
weeks
had
no
intention
of
undermining
the
boys
faith
but
he
was
deeply
interested
in
religion
and
found
it
an
absorbing
topic
of
conversation
he
had
described
his
own
views
accurately
when
he
said
that
he
very
earnestly
disbelieved
in
almost
everything
that
other
people
believed
once
philip
asked
him
a
question
which
he
had
heard
his
uncle
put
when
the
conversation
at
the
vicarage
had
fallen
upon
some
mildly
rationalistic
work
which
was
then
exciting
discussion
in
the
newspapers
but
why
should
you
be
right
and
all
those
fellows
like
st
anselm
and
st
augustine
be
wrong
you
mean
that
they
were
very
clever
and
learned
men
while
you
have
grave
doubts
whether
i
am
either
asked
weeks
yes
answered
philip
uncertainly
for
put
in
that
way
his
question
seemed
impertinent
st
augustine
believed
that
the
earth
was
flat
and
that
the
sun
turned
round
it
i
dont
know
what
that
proves
why
it
proves
that
you
believe
with
your
generation
your
saints
lived
in
an
age
of
faith
when
it
was
practically
impossible
to
disbelieve
what
to
us
is
positively
incredible
then
how
dyou
know
that
we
have
the
truth
now
i
dont
philip
thought
this
over
for
a
moment
then
he
said
i
dont
see
why
the
things
we
believe
absolutely
now
shouldnt
be
just
as
wrong
as
what
they
believed
in
the
past
neither
do
i
then
how
can
you
believe
anything
at
all
i
dont
know
philip
asked
weeks
what
he
thought
of
haywards
religion
men
have
always
formed
gods
in
their
own
image
said
weeks
he
believes
in
the
picturesque
philip
paused
for
a
little
while
then
he
said
i
dont
see
why
one
should
believe
in
god
at
all
the
words
were
no
sooner
out
of
his
mouth
than
he
realised
that
he
had
ceased
to
do
so
it
took
his
breath
away
like
a
plunge
into
cold
water
he
looked
at
weeks
with
startled
eyes
suddenly
he
felt
afraid
he
left
weeks
as
quickly
as
he
could
he
wanted
to
be
alone
it
was
the
most
startling
experience
that
he
had
ever
had
he
tried
to
think
it
all
out
it
was
very
exciting
since
his
whole
life
seemed
concerned
he
thought
his
decision
on
this
matter
must
profoundly
affect
its
course
and
a
mistake
might
lead
to
eternal
damnation
but
the
more
he
reflected
the
more
convinced
he
was
and
though
during
the
next
few
weeks
he
read
books
aids
to
scepticism
with
eager
interest
it
was
only
to
confirm
him
in
what
he
felt
instinctively
the
fact
was
that
he
had
ceased
to
believe
not
for
this
reason
or
the
other
but
because
he
had
not
the
religious
temperament
faith
had
been
forced
upon
him
from
the
outside
it
was
a
matter
of
environment
and
example
a
new
environment
and
a
new
example
gave
him
the
opportunity
to
find
himself
he
put
off
the
faith
of
his
childhood
quite
simply
like
a
cloak
that
he
no
longer
needed
at
first
life
seemed
strange
and
lonely
without
the
belief
which
though
he
never
realised
it
had
been
an
unfailing
support
he
felt
like
a
man
who
has
leaned
on
a
stick
and
finds
himself
forced
suddenly
to
walk
without
assistance
it
really
seemed
as
though
the
days
were
colder
and
the
nights
more
solitary
but
he
was
upheld
by
the
excitement
it
seemed
to
make
life
a
more
thrilling
adventure
and
in
a
little
while
the
stick
which
he
had
thrown
aside
the
cloak
which
had
fallen
from
his
shoulders
seemed
an
intolerable
burden
of
which
he
had
been
eased
the
religious
exercises
which
for
so
many
years
had
been
forced
upon
him
were
part
and
parcel
of
religion
to
him
he
thought
of
the
collects
and
epistles
which
he
had
been
made
to
learn
by
heart
and
the
long
services
at
the
cathedral
through
which
he
had
sat
when
every
limb
itched
with
the
desire
for
movement
and
he
remembered
those
walks
at
night
through
muddy
roads
to
the
parish
church
at
blackstable
and
the
coldness
of
that
bleak
building
he
sat
with
his
feet
like
ice
his
fingers
numb
and
heavy
and
all
around
was
the
sickly
odour
of
pomatum
oh
he
had
been
so
bored
his
heart
leaped
when
he
saw
he
was
free
from
all
that
he
was
surprised
at
himself
because
he
ceased
to
believe
so
easily
and
not
knowing
that
he
felt
as
he
did
on
account
of
the
subtle
workings
of
his
inmost
nature
he
ascribed
the
certainty
he
had
reached
to
his
own
cleverness
he
was
unduly
pleased
with
himself
with
youths
lack
of
sympathy
for
an
attitude
other
than
its
own
he
despised
not
a
little
weeks
and
hayward
because
they
were
content
with
the
vague
emotion
which
they
called
god
and
would
not
take
the
further
step
which
to
himself
seemed
so
obvious
one
day
he
went
alone
up
a
certain
hill
so
that
he
might
see
a
view
which
he
knew
not
why
filled
him
always
with
wild
exhilaration
it
was
autumn
now
but
often
the
days
were
cloudless
still
and
then
the
sky
seemed
to
glow
with
a
more
splendid
light
it
was
as
though
nature
consciously
sought
to
put
a
fuller
vehemence
into
the
remaining
days
of
fair
weather
he
looked
down
upon
the
plain
aquiver
with
the
sun
stretching
vastly
before
him
in
the
distance
were
the
roofs
of
mannheim
and
ever
so
far
away
the
dimness
of
worms
here
and
there
a
more
piercing
glitter
was
the
rhine
the
tremendous
spaciousness
of
it
was
glowing
with
rich
gold
philip
as
he
stood
there
his
heart
beating
with
sheer
joy
thought
how
the
tempter
had
stood
with
jesus
on
a
high
mountain
and
shown
him
the
kingdoms
of
the
earth
to
philip
intoxicated
with
the
beauty
of
the
scene
it
seemed
that
it
was
the
whole
world
which
was
spread
before
him
and
he
was
eager
to
step
down
and
enjoy
it
he
was
free
from
degrading
fears
and
free
from
prejudice
he
could
go
his
way
without
the
intolerable
dread
of
hellfire
suddenly
he
realised
that
he
had
lost
also
that
burden
of
responsibility
which
made
every
action
of
his
life
a
matter
of
urgent
consequence
he
could
breathe
more
freely
in
a
lighter
air
he
was
responsible
only
to
himself
for
the
things
he
did
freedom
he
was
his
own
master
at
last
from
old
habit
unconsciously
he
thanked
god
that
he
no
longer
believed
in
him
drunk
with
pride
in
his
intelligence
and
in
his
fearlessness
philip
entered
deliberately
upon
a
new
life
but
his
loss
of
faith
made
less
difference
in
his
behaviour
than
he
expected
though
he
had
thrown
on
one
side
the
christian
dogmas
it
never
occurred
to
him
to
criticise
the
christian
ethics
he
accepted
the
christian
virtues
and
indeed
thought
it
fine
to
practise
them
for
their
own
sake
without
a
thought
of
reward
or
punishment
there
was
small
occasion
for
heroism
in
the
frau
professors
house
but
he
was
a
little
more
exactly
truthful
than
he
had
been
and
he
forced
himself
to
be
more
than
commonly
attentive
to
the
dull
elderly
ladies
who
sometimes
engaged
him
in
conversation
the
gentle
oath
the
violent
adjective
which
are
typical
of
our
language
and
which
he
had
cultivated
before
as
a
sign
of
manliness
he
now
elaborately
eschewed
having
settled
the
whole
matter
to
his
satisfaction
he
sought
to
put
it
out
of
his
mind
but
that
was
more
easily
said
than
done
and
he
could
not
prevent
the
regrets
nor
stifle
the
misgivings
which
sometimes
tormented
him
he
was
so
young
and
had
so
few
friends
that
immortality
had
no
particular
attractions
for
him
and
he
was
able
without
trouble
to
give
up
belief
in
it
but
there
was
one
thing
which
made
him
wretched
he
told
himself
that
he
was
unreasonable
he
tried
to
laugh
himself
out
of
such
pathos
but
the
tears
really
came
to
his
eyes
when
he
thought
that
he
would
never
see
again
the
beautiful
mother
whose
love
for
him
had
grown
more
precious
as
the
years
since
her
death
passed
on
and
sometimes
as
though
the
influence
of
innumerable
ancestors
godfearing
and
devout
were
working
in
him
unconsciously
there
seized
him
a
panic
fear
that
perhaps
after
all
it
was
all
true
and
there
was
up
there
behind
the
blue
sky
a
jealous
god
who
would
punish
in
everlasting
flames
the
atheist
at
these
times
his
reason
could
offer
him
no
help
he
imagined
the
anguish
of
a
physical
torment
which
would
last
endlessly
he
felt
quite
sick
with
fear
and
burst
into
a
violent
sweat
at
last
he
would
say
to
himself
desperately
after
all
its
not
my
fault
i
cant
force
myself
to
believe
if
there
is
a
god
after
all
and
he
punishes
me
because
i
honestly
dont
believe
in
him
i
cant
help
it
chapter
xxix
winter
set
in
weeks
went
to
berlin
to
attend
the
lectures
of
paulssen
and
hayward
began
to
think
of
going
south
the
local
theatre
opened
its
doors
philip
and
hayward
went
to
it
two
or
three
times
a
week
with
the
praiseworthy
intention
of
improving
their
german
and
philip
found
it
a
more
diverting
manner
of
perfecting
himself
in
the
language
than
listening
to
sermons
they
found
themselves
in
the
midst
of
a
revival
of
the
drama
several
of
ibsens
plays
were
on
the
repertory
for
the
winter
sudermanns
die
ehre
was
then
a
new
play
and
on
its
production
in
the
quiet
university
town
caused
the
greatest
excitement
it
was
extravagantly
praised
and
bitterly
attacked
other
dramatists
followed
with
plays
written
under
the
modern
influence
and
philip
witnessed
a
series
of
works
in
which
the
vileness
of
mankind
was
displayed
before
him
he
had
never
been
to
a
play
in
his
life
till
then
poor
touring
companies
sometimes
came
to
the
assembly
rooms
at
blackstable
but
the
vicar
partly
on
account
of
his
profession
partly
because
he
thought
it
would
be
vulgar
never
went
to
see
them
and
the
passion
of
the
stage
seized
him
he
felt
a
thrill
the
moment
he
got
into
the
little
shabby
illlit
theatre
soon
he
came
to
know
the
peculiarities
of
the
small
company
and
by
the
casting
could
tell
at
once
what
were
the
characteristics
of
the
persons
in
the
drama
but
this
made
no
difference
to
him
to
him
it
was
real
life
it
was
a
strange
life
dark
and
tortured
in
which
men
and
women
showed
to
remorseless
eyes
the
evil
that
was
in
their
hearts
a
fair
face
concealed
a
depraved
mind
the
virtuous
used
virtue
as
a
mask
to
hide
their
secret
vice
the
seemingstrong
fainted
within
with
their
weakness
the
honest
were
corrupt
the
chaste
were
lewd
you
seemed
to
dwell
in
a
room
where
the
night
before
an
orgy
had
taken
place
the
windows
had
not
been
opened
in
the
morning
the
air
was
foul
with
the
dregs
of
beer
and
stale
smoke
and
flaring
gas
there
was
no
laughter
at
most
you
sniggered
at
the
hypocrite
or
the
fool
the
characters
expressed
themselves
in
cruel
words
that
seemed
wrung
out
of
their
hearts
by
shame
and
anguish
philip
was
carried
away
by
the
sordid
intensity
of
it
he
seemed
to
see
the
world
again
in
another
fashion
and
this
world
too
he
was
anxious
to
know
after
the
play
was
over
he
went
to
a
tavern
and
sat
in
the
bright
warmth
with
hayward
to
eat
a
sandwich
and
drink
a
glass
of
beer
all
round
were
little
groups
of
students
talking
and
laughing
and
here
and
there
was
a
family
father
and
mother
a
couple
of
sons
and
a
girl
and
sometimes
the
girl
said
a
sharp
thing
and
the
father
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
laughed
laughed
heartily
it
was
very
friendly
and
innocent
there
was
a
pleasant
homeliness
in
the
scene
but
for
this
philip
had
no
eyes
his
thoughts
ran
on
the
play
he
had
just
come
from
you
do
feel
its
life
dont
you
he
said
excitedly
you
know
i
dont
think
i
can
stay
here
much
longer
i
want
to
get
to
london
so
that
i
can
really
begin
i
want
to
have
experiences
im
so
tired
of
preparing
for
life
i
want
to
live
it
now
sometimes
hayward
left
philip
to
go
home
by
himself
he
would
never
exactly
reply
to
philips
eager
questioning
but
with
a
merry
rather
stupid
laugh
hinted
at
a
romantic
amour
he
quoted
a
few
lines
of
rossetti
and
once
showed
philip
a
sonnet
in
which
passion
and
purple
pessimism
and
pathos
were
packed
together
on
the
subject
of
a
young
lady
called
trude
hayward
surrounded
his
sordid
and
vulgar
little
adventures
with
a
glow
of
poetry
and
thought
he
touched
hands
with
pericles
and
pheidias
because
to
describe
the
object
of
his
attentions
he
used
the
word
hetaira
instead
of
one
of
those
more
blunt
and
apt
provided
by
the
english
language
philip
in
the
daytime
had
been
led
by
curiosity
to
pass
through
the
little
street
near
the
old
bridge
with
its
neat
white
houses
and
green
shutters
in
which
according
to
hayward
the
fraulein
trude
lived
but
the
women
with
brutal
faces
and
painted
cheeks
who
came
out
of
their
doors
and
cried
out
to
him
filled
him
with
fear
and
he
fled
in
horror
from
the
rough
hands
that
sought
to
detain
him
he
yearned
above
all
things
for
experience
and
felt
himself
ridiculous
because
at
his
age
he
had
not
enjoyed
that
which
all
fiction
taught
him
was
the
most
important
thing
in
life
but
he
had
the
unfortunate
gift
of
seeing
things
as
they
were
and
the
reality
which
was
offered
him
differed
too
terribly
from
the
ideal
of
his
dreams
he
did
not
know
how
wide
a
country
arid
and
precipitous
must
be
crossed
before
the
traveller
through
life
comes
to
an
acceptance
of
reality
it
is
an
illusion
that
youth
is
happy
an
illusion
of
those
who
have
lost
it
but
the
young
know
they
are
wretched
for
they
are
full
of
the
truthless
ideals
which
have
been
instilled
into
them
and
each
time
they
come
in
contact
with
the
real
they
are
bruised
and
wounded
it
looks
as
if
they
were
victims
of
a
conspiracy
for
the
books
they
read
ideal
by
the
necessity
of
selection
and
the
conversation
of
their
elders
who
look
back
upon
the
past
through
a
rosy
haze
of
forgetfulness
prepare
them
for
an
unreal
life
they
must
discover
for
themselves
that
all
they
have
read
and
all
they
have
been
told
are
lies
lies
lies
and
each
discovery
is
another
nail
driven
into
the
body
on
the
cross
of
life
the
strange
thing
is
that
each
one
who
has
gone
through
that
bitter
disillusionment
adds
to
it
in
his
turn
unconsciously
by
the
power
within
him
which
is
stronger
than
himself
the
companionship
of
hayward
was
the
worst
possible
thing
for
philip
he
was
a
man
who
saw
nothing
for
himself
but
only
through
a
literary
atmosphere
and
he
was
dangerous
because
he
had
deceived
himself
into
sincerity
he
honestly
mistook
his
sensuality
for
romantic
emotion
his
vacillation
for
the
artistic
temperament
and
his
idleness
for
philosophic
calm
his
mind
vulgar
in
its
effort
at
refinement
saw
everything
a
little
larger
than
life
size
with
the
outlines
blurred
in
a
golden
mist
of
sentimentality
he
lied
and
never
knew
that
he
lied
and
when
it
was
pointed
out
to
him
said
that
lies
were
beautiful
he
was
an
idealist
chapter
xxx
philip
was
restless
and
dissatisfied
haywards
poetic
allusions
troubled
his
imagination
and
his
soul
yearned
for
romance
at
least
that
was
how
he
put
it
to
himself
and
it
happened
that
an
incident
was
taking
place
in
frau
erlins
house
which
increased
philips
preoccupation
with
the
matter
of
sex
two
or
three
times
on
his
walks
among
the
hills
he
had
met
fraulein
cacilie
wandering
by
herself
he
had
passed
her
with
a
bow
and
a
few
yards
further
on
had
seen
the
chinaman
he
thought
nothing
of
it
but
one
evening
on
his
way
home
when
night
had
already
fallen
he
passed
two
people
walking
very
close
together
hearing
his
footstep
they
separated
quickly
and
though
he
could
not
see
well
in
the
darkness
he
was
almost
certain
they
were
cacilie
and
herr
sung
their
rapid
movement
apart
suggested
that
they
had
been
walking
arm
in
arm
philip
was
puzzled
and
surprised
he
had
never
paid
much
attention
to
fraulein
cacilie
she
was
a
plain
girl
with
a
square
face
and
blunt
features
she
could
not
have
been
more
than
sixteen
since
she
still
wore
her
long
fair
hair
in
a
plait
that
evening
at
supper
he
looked
at
her
curiously
and
though
of
late
she
had
talked
little
at
meals
she
addressed
him
where
did
you
go
for
your
walk
today
herr
carey
she
asked
oh
i
walked
up
towards
the
konigstuhl
i
didnt
go
out
she
volunteered
i
had
a
headache
the
chinaman
who
sat
next
to
her
turned
round
im
so
sorry
he
said
i
hope
its
better
now
fraulein
cacilie
was
evidently
uneasy
for
she
spoke
again
to
philip
did
you
meet
many
people
on
the
way
philip
could
not
help
reddening
when
he
told
a
downright
lie
no
i
dont
think
i
saw
a
living
soul
he
fancied
that
a
look
of
relief
passed
across
her
eyes
soon
however
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
there
was
something
between
the
pair
and
other
people
in
the
frau
professors
house
saw
them
lurking
in
dark
places
the
elderly
ladies
who
sat
at
the
head
of
the
table
began
to
discuss
what
was
now
a
scandal
the
frau
professor
was
angry
and
harassed
she
had
done
her
best
to
see
nothing
the
winter
was
at
hand
and
it
was
not
as
easy
a
matter
then
as
in
the
summer
to
keep
her
house
full
herr
sung
was
a
good
customer
he
had
two
rooms
on
the
ground
floor
and
he
drank
a
bottle
of
moselle
at
each
meal
the
frau
professor
charged
him
three
marks
a
bottle
and
made
a
good
profit
none
of
her
other
guests
drank
wine
and
some
of
them
did
not
even
drink
beer
neither
did
she
wish
to
lose
fraulein
cacilie
whose
parents
were
in
business
in
south
america
and
paid
well
for
the
frau
professors
motherly
care
and
she
knew
that
if
she
wrote
to
the
girls
uncle
who
lived
in
berlin
he
would
immediately
take
her
away
the
frau
professor
contented
herself
with
giving
them
both
severe
looks
at
table
and
though
she
dared
not
be
rude
to
the
chinaman
got
a
certain
satisfaction
out
of
incivility
to
cacilie
but
the
three
elderly
ladies
were
not
content
two
were
widows
and
one
a
dutchwoman
was
a
spinster
of
masculine
appearance
they
paid
the
smallest
possible
sum
for
their
pension
and
gave
a
good
deal
of
trouble
but
they
were
permanent
and
therefore
had
to
be
put
up
with
they
went
to
the
frau
professor
and
said
that
something
must
be
done
it
was
disgraceful
and
the
house
was
ceasing
to
be
respectable
the
frau
professor
tried
obstinacy
anger
tears
but
the
three
old
ladies
routed
her
and
with
a
sudden
assumption
of
virtuous
indignation
she
said
that
she
would
put
a
stop
to
the
whole
thing
after
luncheon
she
took
cacilie
into
her
bedroom
and
began
to
talk
very
seriously
to
her
but
to
her
amazement
the
girl
adopted
a
brazen
attitude
she
proposed
to
go
about
as
she
liked
and
if
she
chose
to
walk
with
the
chinaman
she
could
not
see
it
was
anybodys
business
but
her
own
the
frau
professor
threatened
to
write
to
her
uncle
then
onkel
heinrich
will
put
me
in
a
family
in
berlin
for
the
winter
and
that
will
be
much
nicer
for
me
and
herr
sung
will
come
to
berlin
too
the
frau
professor
began
to
cry
the
tears
rolled
down
her
coarse
red
fat
cheeks
and
cacilie
laughed
at
her
that
will
mean
three
rooms
empty
all
through
the
winter
she
said
then
the
frau
professor
tried
another
plan
she
appealed
to
fraulein
cacilies
better
nature
she
was
kind
sensible
tolerant
she
treated
her
no
longer
as
a
child
but
as
a
grown
woman
she
said
that
it
wouldnt
be
so
dreadful
but
a
chinaman
with
his
yellow
skin
and
flat
nose
and
his
little
pigs
eyes
thats
what
made
it
so
horrible
it
filled
one
with
disgust
to
think
of
it
bitte
bitte
said
cacilie
with
a
rapid
intake
of
the
breath
i
wont
listen
to
anything
against
him
but
its
not
serious
gasped
frau
erlin
i
love
him
i
love
him
i
love
him
gott
im
himmel
the
frau
professor
stared
at
her
with
horrified
surprise
she
had
thought
it
was
no
more
than
naughtiness
on
the
childs
part
and
innocent
folly
but
the
passion
in
her
voice
revealed
everything
cacilie
looked
at
her
for
a
moment
with
flaming
eyes
and
then
with
a
shrug
of
her
shoulders
went
out
of
the
room
frau
erlin
kept
the
details
of
the
interview
to
herself
and
a
day
or
two
later
altered
the
arrangement
of
the
table
she
asked
herr
sung
if
he
would
not
come
and
sit
at
her
end
and
he
with
his
unfailing
politeness
accepted
with
alacrity
cacilie
took
the
change
indifferently
but
as
if
the
discovery
that
the
relations
between
them
were
known
to
the
whole
household
made
them
more
shameless
they
made
no
secret
now
of
their
walks
together
and
every
afternoon
quite
openly
set
out
to
wander
about
the
hills
it
was
plain
that
they
did
not
care
what
was
said
of
them
at
last
even
the
placidity
of
professor
erlin
was
moved
and
he
insisted
that
his
wife
should
speak
to
the
chinaman
she
took
him
aside
in
his
turn
and
expostulated
he
was
ruining
the
girls
reputation
he
was
doing
harm
to
the
house
he
must
see
how
wrong
and
wicked
his
conduct
was
but
she
was
met
with
smiling
denials
herr
sung
did
not
know
what
she
was
talking
about
he
was
not
paying
any
attention
to
fraulein
cacilie
he
never
walked
with
her
it
was
all
untrue
every
word
of
it
ach
herr
sung
how
can
you
say
such
things
youve
been
seen
again
and
again
no
youre
mistaken
its
untrue
he
looked
at
her
with
an
unceasing
smile
which
showed
his
even
little
white
teeth
he
was
quite
calm
he
denied
everything
he
denied
with
bland
effrontery
at
last
the
frau
professor
lost
her
temper
and
said
the
girl
had
confessed
she
loved
him
he
was
not
moved
he
continued
to
smile
nonsense
nonsense
its
all
untrue
she
could
get
nothing
out
of
him
the
weather
grew
very
bad
there
was
snow
and
frost
and
then
a
thaw
with
a
long
succession
of
cheerless
days
on
which
walking
was
a
poor
amusement
one
evening
when
philip
had
just
finished
his
german
lesson
with
the
herr
professor
and
was
standing
for
a
moment
in
the
drawingroom
talking
to
frau
erlin
anna
came
quickly
in
mamma
where
is
cacilie
she
said
i
suppose
shes
in
her
room
theres
no
light
in
it
the
frau
professor
gave
an
exclamation
and
she
looked
at
her
daughter
in
dismay
the
thought
which
was
in
annas
head
had
flashed
across
hers
ring
for
emil
she
said
hoarsely
this
was
the
stupid
lout
who
waited
at
table
and
did
most
of
the
housework
he
came
in
emil
go
down
to
herr
sungs
room
and
enter
without
knocking
if
anyone
is
there
say
you
came
in
to
see
about
the
stove
no
sign
of
astonishment
appeared
on
emils
phlegmatic
face
he
went
slowly
downstairs
the
frau
professor
and
anna
left
the
door
open
and
listened
presently
they
heard
emil
come
up
again
and
they
called
him
was
anyone
there
asked
the
frau
professor
yes
herr
sung
was
there
was
he
alone
the
beginning
of
a
cunning
smile
narrowed
his
mouth
no
fraulein
cacilie
was
there
oh
its
disgraceful
cried
the
frau
professor
now
he
smiled
broadly
fraulein
cacilie
is
there
every
evening
she
spends
hours
at
a
time
there
frau
professor
began
to
wring
her
hands
oh
how
abominable
but
why
didnt
you
tell
me
it
was
no
business
of
mine
he
answered
slowly
shrugging
his
shoulders
i
suppose
they
paid
you
well
go
away
go
he
lurched
clumsily
to
the
door
they
must
go
away
mamma
said
anna
and
who
is
going
to
pay
the
rent
and
the
taxes
are
falling
due
its
all
very
well
for
you
to
say
they
must
go
away
if
they
go
away
i
cant
pay
the
bills
she
turned
to
philip
with
tears
streaming
down
her
face
ach
herr
carey
you
will
not
say
what
you
have
heard
if
fraulein
forster
this
was
the
dutch
spinsterif
fraulein
forster
knew
she
would
leave
at
once
and
if
they
all
go
we
must
close
the
house
i
cannot
afford
to
keep
it
of
course
i
wont
say
anything
if
she
stays
i
will
not
speak
to
her
said
anna
that
evening
at
supper
fraulein
cacilie
redder
than
usual
with
a
look
of
obstinacy
on
her
face
took
her
place
punctually
but
herr
sung
did
not
appear
and
for
a
while
philip
thought
he
was
going
to
shirk
the
ordeal
at
last
he
came
very
smiling
his
little
eyes
dancing
with
the
apologies
he
made
for
his
late
arrival
he
insisted
as
usual
on
pouring
out
the
frau
professor
a
glass
of
his
moselle
and
he
offered
a
glass
to
fraulein
forster
the
room
was
very
hot
for
the
stove
had
been
alight
all
day
and
the
windows
were
seldom
opened
emil
blundered
about
but
succeeded
somehow
in
serving
everyone
quickly
and
with
order
the
three
old
ladies
sat
in
silence
visibly
disapproving
the
frau
professor
had
scarcely
recovered
from
her
tears
her
husband
was
silent
and
oppressed
conversation
languished
it
seemed
to
philip
that
there
was
something
dreadful
in
that
gathering
which
he
had
sat
with
so
often
they
looked
different
under
the
light
of
the
two
hanging
lamps
from
what
they
had
ever
looked
before
he
was
vaguely
uneasy
once
he
caught
cacilies
eye
and
he
thought
she
looked
at
him
with
hatred
and
contempt
the
room
was
stifling
it
was
as
though
the
beastly
passion
of
that
pair
troubled
them
all
there
was
a
feeling
of
oriental
depravity
a
faint
savour
of
josssticks
a
mystery
of
hidden
vices
seemed
to
make
their
breath
heavy
philip
could
feel
the
beating
of
the
arteries
in
his
forehead
he
could
not
understand
what
strange
emotion
distracted
him
he
seemed
to
feel
something
infinitely
attractive
and
yet
he
was
repelled
and
horrified
for
several
days
things
went
on
the
air
was
sickly
with
the
unnatural
passion
which
all
felt
about
them
and
the
nerves
of
the
little
household
seemed
to
grow
exasperated
only
herr
sung
remained
unaffected
he
was
no
less
smiling
affable
and
polite
than
he
had
been
before
one
could
not
tell
whether
his
manner
was
a
triumph
of
civilisation
or
an
expression
of
contempt
on
the
part
of
the
oriental
for
the
vanquished
west
cacilie
was
flaunting
and
cynical
at
last
even
the
frau
professor
could
bear
the
position
no
longer
suddenly
panic
seized
her
for
professor
erlin
with
brutal
frankness
had
suggested
the
possible
consequences
of
an
intrigue
which
was
now
manifest
to
everyone
and
she
saw
her
good
name
in
heidelberg
and
the
repute
of
her
house
ruined
by
a
scandal
which
could
not
possibly
be
hidden
for
some
reason
blinded
perhaps
by
her
interests
this
possibility
had
never
occurred
to
her
and
now
her
wits
muddled
by
a
terrible
fear
she
could
hardly
be
prevented
from
turning
the
girl
out
of
the
house
at
once
it
was
due
to
annas
good
sense
that
a
cautious
letter
was
written
to
the
uncle
in
berlin
suggesting
that
cacilie
should
be
taken
away
but
having
made
up
her
mind
to
lose
the
two
lodgers
the
frau
professor
could
not
resist
the
satisfaction
of
giving
rein
to
the
illtemper
she
had
curbed
so
long
she
was
free
now
to
say
anything
she
liked
to
cacilie
i
have
written
to
your
uncle
cacilie
to
take
you
away
i
cannot
have
you
in
my
house
any
longer
her
little
round
eyes
sparkled
when
she
noticed
the
sudden
whiteness
of
the
girls
face
youre
shameless
shameless
she
went
on
she
called
her
foul
names
what
did
you
say
to
my
uncle
heinrich
frau
professor
the
girl
asked
suddenly
falling
from
her
attitude
of
flaunting
independence
oh
hell
tell
you
himself
i
expect
to
get
a
letter
from
him
tomorrow
next
day
in
order
to
make
the
humiliation
more
public
at
supper
she
called
down
the
table
to
cacilie
i
have
had
a
letter
from
your
uncle
cacilie
you
are
to
pack
your
things
tonight
and
we
will
put
you
in
the

tomorrow
morning
he
will
meet
you
himself
in
berlin
at
the
central
bahnhof
very
good
frau
professor
herr
sung
smiled
in
the
frau
professors
eyes
and
notwithstanding
her
protests
insisted
on
pouring
out
a
glass
of
wine
for
her
the
frau
professor
ate
her
supper
with
a
good
appetite
but
she
had
triumphed
unwisely
just
before
going
to
bed
she
called
the
servant
emil
if
fraulein
cacilies
box
is
ready
you
had
better
take
it
downstairs
tonight
the
porter
will
fetch
it
before
breakfast
the
servant
went
away
and
in
a
moment
came
back
fraulein
cacilie
is
not
in
her
room
and
her
bag
has
gone
with
a
cry
the
frau
professor
hurried
along
the
box
was
on
the
floor
strapped
and
locked
but
there
was
no
bag
and
neither
hat
nor
cloak
the
dressingtable
was
empty
breathing
heavily
the
frau
professor
ran
downstairs
to
the
chinamans
rooms
she
had
not
moved
so
quickly
for
twenty
years
and
emil
called
out
after
her
to
beware
she
did
not
fall
she
did
not
trouble
to
knock
but
burst
in
the
rooms
were
empty
the
luggage
had
gone
and
the
door
into
the
garden
still
open
showed
how
it
had
been
got
away
in
an
envelope
on
the
table
were
notes
for
the
money
due
on
the
months
board
and
an
approximate
sum
for
extras
groaning
suddenly
overcome
by
her
haste
the
frau
professor
sank
obesely
on
to
a
sofa
there
could
be
no
doubt
the
pair
had
gone
off
together
emil
remained
stolid
and
unmoved
chapter
xxxi
hayward
after
saying
for
a
month
that
he
was
going
south
next
day
and
delaying
from
week
to
week
out
of
inability
to
make
up
his
mind
to
the
bother
of
packing
and
the
tedium
of
a
journey
had
at
last
been
driven
off
just
before
christmas
by
the
preparations
for
that
festival
he
could
not
support
the
thought
of
a
teutonic
merrymaking
it
gave
him
gooseflesh
to
think
of
the
seasons
aggressive
cheerfulness
and
in
his
desire
to
avoid
the
obvious
he
determined
to
travel
on
christmas
eve
philip
was
not
sorry
to
see
him
off
for
he
was
a
downright
person
and
it
irritated
him
that
anybody
should
not
know
his
own
mind
though
much
under
haywards
influence
he
would
not
grant
that
indecision
pointed
to
a
charming
sensitiveness
and
he
resented
the
shadow
of
a
sneer
with
which
hayward
looked
upon
his
straight
ways
they
corresponded
hayward
was
an
admirable
letterwriter
and
knowing
his
talent
took
pains
with
his
letters
his
temperament
was
receptive
to
the
beautiful
influences
with
which
he
came
in
contact
and
he
was
able
in
his
letters
from
rome
to
put
a
subtle
fragrance
of
italy
he
thought
the
city
of
the
ancient
romans
a
little
vulgar
finding
distinction
only
in
the
decadence
of
the
empire
but
the
rome
of
the
popes
appealed
to
his
sympathy
and
in
his
chosen
words
quite
exquisitely
there
appeared
a
rococo
beauty
he
wrote
of
old
church
music
and
the
alban
hills
and
of
the
languor
of
incense
and
the
charm
of
the
streets
by
night
in
the
rain
when
the
pavements
shone
and
the
light
of
the
street
lamps
was
mysterious
perhaps
he
repeated
these
admirable
letters
to
various
friends
he
did
not
know
what
a
troubling
effect
they
had
upon
philip
they
seemed
to
make
his
life
very
humdrum
with
the
spring
hayward
grew
dithyrambic
he
proposed
that
philip
should
come
down
to
italy
he
was
wasting
his
time
at
heidelberg
the
germans
were
gross
and
life
there
was
common
how
could
the
soul
come
to
her
own
in
that
prim
landscape
in
tuscany
the
spring
was
scattering
flowers
through
the
land
and
philip
was
nineteen
let
him
come
and
they
could
wander
through
the
mountain
towns
of
umbria
their
names
sang
in
philips
heart
and
cacilie
too
with
her
lover
had
gone
to
italy
when
he
thought
of
them
philip
was
seized
with
a
restlessness
he
could
not
account
for
he
cursed
his
fate
because
he
had
no
money
to
travel
and
he
knew
his
uncle
would
not
send
him
more
than
the
fifteen
pounds
a
month
which
had
been
agreed
upon
he
had
not
managed
his
allowance
very
well
his
pension
and
the
price
of
his
lessons
left
him
very
little
over
and
he
had
found
going
about
with
hayward
expensive
hayward
had
often
suggested
excursions
a
visit
to
the
play
or
a
bottle
of
wine
when
philip
had
come
to
the
end
of
his
months
money
and
with
the
folly
of
his
age
he
had
been
unwilling
to
confess
he
could
not
afford
an
extravagance
luckily
haywards
letters
came
seldom
and
in
the
intervals
philip
settled
down
again
to
his
industrious
life
he
had
matriculated
at
the
university
and
attended
one
or
two
courses
of
lectures
kuno
fischer
was
then
at
the
height
of
his
fame
and
during
the
winter
had
been
lecturing
brilliantly
on
schopenhauer
it
was
philips
introduction
to
philosophy
he
had
a
practical
mind
and
moved
uneasily
amid
the
abstract
but
he
found
an
unexpected
fascination
in
listening
to
metaphysical
disquisitions
they
made
him
breathless
it
was
a
little
like
watching
a
tightrope
dancer
doing
perilous
feats
over
an
abyss
but
it
was
very
exciting
the
pessimism
of
the
subject
attracted
his
youth
and
he
believed
that
the
world
he
was
about
to
enter
was
a
place
of
pitiless
woe
and
of
darkness
that
made
him
none
the
less
eager
to
enter
it
and
when
in
due
course
mrs
carey
acting
as
the
correspondent
for
his
guardians
views
suggested
that
it
was
time
for
him
to
come
back
to
england
he
agreed
with
enthusiasm
he
must
make
up
his
mind
now
what
he
meant
to
do
if
he
left
heidelberg
at
the
end
of
july
they
could
talk
things
over
during
august
and
it
would
be
a
good
time
to
make
arrangements
the
date
of
his
departure
was
settled
and
mrs
carey
wrote
to
him
again
she
reminded
him
of
miss
wilkinson
through
whose
kindness
he
had
gone
to
frau
erlins
house
at
heidelberg
and
told
him
that
she
had
arranged
to
spend
a
few
weeks
with
them
at
blackstable
she
would
be
crossing
from
flushing
on
such
and
such
a
day
and
if
he
travelled
at
the
same
time
he
could
look
after
her
and
come
on
to
blackstable
in
her
company
philips
shyness
immediately
made
him
write
to
say
that
he
could
not
leave
till
a
day
or
two
afterwards
he
pictured
himself
looking
out
for
miss
wilkinson
the
embarrassment
of
going
up
to
her
and
asking
if
it
were
she
and
he
might
so
easily
address
the
wrong
person
and
be
snubbed
and
then
the
difficulty
of
knowing
whether
in
the
train
he
ought
to
talk
to
her
or
whether
he
could
ignore
her
and
read
his
book
at
last
he
left
heidelberg
for
three
months
he
had
been
thinking
of
nothing
but
the
future
and
he
went
without
regret
he
never
knew
that
he
had
been
happy
there
fraulein
anna
gave
him
a
copy
of
der
trompeter
von
sackingen
and
in
return
he
presented
her
with
a
volume
of
william
morris
very
wisely
neither
of
them
ever
read
the
others
present
chapter
xxxii
philip
was
surprised
when
he
saw
his
uncle
and
aunt
he
had
never
noticed
before
that
they
were
quite
old
people
the
vicar
received
him
with
his
usual
not
unamiable
indifference
he
was
a
little
stouter
a
little
balder
a
little
grayer
philip
saw
how
insignificant
he
was
his
face
was
weak
and
selfindulgent
aunt
louisa
took
him
in
her
arms
and
kissed
him
and
tears
of
happiness
flowed
down
her
cheeks
philip
was
touched
and
embarrassed
he
had
not
known
with
what
a
hungry
love
she
cared
for
him
oh
the
time
has
seemed
long
since
youve
been
away
philip
she
cried
she
stroked
his
hands
and
looked
into
his
face
with
glad
eyes
youve
grown
youre
quite
a
man
now
there
was
a
very
small
moustache
on
his
upper
lip
he
had
bought
a
razor
and
now
and
then
with
infinite
care
shaved
the
down
off
his
smooth
chin
weve
been
so
lonely
without
you
and
then
shyly
with
a
little
break
in
her
voice
she
asked
you
are
glad
to
come
back
to
your
home
arent
you
yes
rather
she
was
so
thin
that
she
seemed
almost
transparent
the
arms
she
put
round
his
neck
were
frail
bones
that
reminded
you
of
chicken
bones
and
her
faded
face
was
oh
so
wrinkled
the
gray
curls
which
she
still
wore
in
the
fashion
of
her
youth
gave
her
a
queer
pathetic
look
and
her
little
withered
body
was
like
an
autumn
leaf
you
felt
it
might
be
blown
away
by
the
first
sharp
wind
philip
realised
that
they
had
done
with
life
these
two
quiet
little
people
they
belonged
to
a
past
generation
and
they
were
waiting
there
patiently
rather
stupidly
for
death
and
he
in
his
vigour
and
his
youth
thirsting
for
excitement
and
adventure
was
appalled
at
the
waste
they
had
done
nothing
and
when
they
went
it
would
be
just
as
if
they
had
never
been
he
felt
a
great
pity
for
aunt
louisa
and
he
loved
her
suddenly
because
she
loved
him
then
miss
wilkinson
who
had
kept
discreetly
out
of
the
way
till
the
careys
had
had
a
chance
of
welcoming
their
nephew
came
into
the
room
this
is
miss
wilkinson
philip
said
mrs
carey
the
prodigal
has
returned
she
said
holding
out
her
hand
i
have
brought
a
rose
for
the
prodigals
buttonhole
with
a
gay
smile
she
pinned
to
philips
coat
the
flower
she
had
just
picked
in
the
garden
he
blushed
and
felt
foolish
he
knew
that
miss
wilkinson
was
the
daughter
of
his
uncle
williams
last
rector
and
he
had
a
wide
acquaintance
with
the
daughters
of
clergymen
they
wore
illcut
clothes
and
stout
boots
they
were
generally
dressed
in
black
for
in
philips
early
years
at
blackstable
homespuns
had
not
reached
east
anglia
and
the
ladies
of
the
clergy
did
not
favour
colours
their
hair
was
done
very
untidily
and
they
smelt
aggressively
of
starched
linen
they
considered
the
feminine
graces
unbecoming
and
looked
the
same
whether
they
were
old
or
young
they
bore
their
religion
arrogantly
the
closeness
of
their
connection
with
the
church
made
them
adopt
a
slightly
dictatorial
attitude
to
the
rest
of
mankind
miss
wilkinson
was
very
different
she
wore
a
white
muslin
gown
stamped
with
gay
little
bunches
of
flowers
and
pointed
highheeled
shoes
with
openwork
stockings
to
philips
inexperience
it
seemed
that
she
was
wonderfully
dressed
he
did
not
see
that
her
frock
was
cheap
and
showy
her
hair
was
elaborately
dressed
with
a
neat
curl
in
the
middle
of
the
forehead
it
was
very
black
shiny
and
hard
and
it
looked
as
though
it
could
never
be
in
the
least
disarranged
she
had
large
black
eyes
and
her
nose
was
slightly
aquiline
in
profile
she
had
somewhat
the
look
of
a
bird
of
prey
but
full
face
she
was
prepossessing
she
smiled
a
great
deal
but
her
mouth
was
large
and
when
she
smiled
she
tried
to
hide
her
teeth
which
were
big
and
rather
yellow
but
what
embarrassed
philip
most
was
that
she
was
heavily
powdered
he
had
very
strict
views
on
feminine
behaviour
and
did
not
think
a
lady
ever
powdered
but
of
course
miss
wilkinson
was
a
lady
because
she
was
a
clergymans
daughter
and
a
clergyman
was
a
gentleman
philip
made
up
his
mind
to
dislike
her
thoroughly
she
spoke
with
a
slight
french
accent
and
he
did
not
know
why
she
should
since
she
had
been
born
and
bred
in
the
heart
of
england
he
thought
her
smile
affected
and
the
coy
sprightliness
of
her
manner
irritated
him
for
two
or
three
days
he
remained
silent
and
hostile
but
miss
wilkinson
apparently
did
not
notice
it
she
was
very
affable
she
addressed
her
conversation
almost
exclusively
to
him
and
there
was
something
flattering
in
the
way
she
appealed
constantly
to
his
sane
judgment
she
made
him
laugh
too
and
philip
could
never
resist
people
who
amused
him
he
had
a
gift
now
and
then
of
saying
neat
things
and
it
was
pleasant
to
have
an
appreciative
listener
neither
the
vicar
nor
mrs
carey
had
a
sense
of
humour
and
they
never
laughed
at
anything
he
said
as
he
grew
used
to
miss
wilkinson
and
his
shyness
left
him
he
began
to
like
her
better
he
found
the
french
accent
picturesque
and
at
a
garden
party
which
the
doctor
gave
she
was
very
much
better
dressed
than
anyone
else
she
wore
a
blue
foulard
with
large
white
spots
and
philip
was
tickled
at
the
sensation
it
caused
im
certain
they
think
youre
no
better
than
you
should
be
he
told
her
laughing
its
the
dream
of
my
life
to
be
taken
for
an
abandoned
hussy
she
answered
one
day
when
miss
wilkinson
was
in
her
room
he
asked
aunt
louisa
how
old
she
was
oh
my
dear
you
should
never
ask
a
ladys
age
but
shes
certainly
too
old
for
you
to
marry
the
vicar
gave
his
slow
obese
smile
shes
no
chicken
louisa
he
said
she
was
nearly
grown
up
when
we
were
in
lincolnshire
and
that
was
twenty
years
ago
she
wore
a
pigtail
hanging
down
her
back
she
may
not
have
been
more
than
ten
said
philip
she
was
older
than
that
said
aunt
louisa
i
think
she
was
near
twenty
said
the
vicar
oh
no
william
sixteen
or
seventeen
at
the
outside
that
would
make
her
well
over
thirty
said
philip
at
that
moment
miss
wilkinson
tripped
downstairs
singing
a
song
by
benjamin
goddard
she
had
put
her
hat
on
for
she
and
philip
were
going
for
a
walk
and
she
held
out
her
hand
for
him
to
button
her
glove
he
did
it
awkwardly
he
felt
embarrassed
but
gallant
conversation
went
easily
between
them
now
and
as
they
strolled
along
they
talked
of
all
manner
of
things
she
told
philip
about
berlin
and
he
told
her
of
his
year
in
heidelberg
as
he
spoke
things
which
had
appeared
of
no
importance
gained
a
new
interest
he
described
the
people
at
frau
erlins
house
and
to
the
conversations
between
hayward
and
weeks
which
at
the
time
seemed
so
significant
he
gave
a
little
twist
so
that
they
looked
absurd
he
was
flattered
at
miss
wilkinsons
laughter
im
quite
frightened
of
you
she
said
youre
so
sarcastic
then
she
asked
him
playfully
whether
he
had
not
had
any
love
affairs
at
heidelberg
without
thinking
he
frankly
answered
that
he
had
not
but
she
refused
to
believe
him
how
secretive
you
are
she
said
at
your
age
is
it
likely
he
blushed
and
laughed
you
want
to
know
too
much
he
said
ah
i
thought
so
she
laughed
triumphantly
look
at
him
blushing
he
was
pleased
that
she
should
think
he
had
been
a
sad
dog
and
he
changed
the
conversation
so
as
to
make
her
believe
he
had
all
sorts
of
romantic
things
to
conceal
he
was
angry
with
himself
that
he
had
not
there
had
been
no
opportunity
miss
wilkinson
was
dissatisfied
with
her
lot
she
resented
having
to
earn
her
living
and
told
philip
a
long
story
of
an
uncle
of
her
mothers
who
had
been
expected
to
leave
her
a
fortune
but
had
married
his
cook
and
changed
his
will
she
hinted
at
the
luxury
of
her
home
and
compared
her
life
in
lincolnshire
with
horses
to
ride
and
carriages
to
drive
in
with
the
mean
dependence
of
her
present
state
philip
was
a
little
puzzled
when
he
mentioned
this
afterwards
to
aunt
louisa
and
she
told
him
that
when
she
knew
the
wilkinsons
they
had
never
had
anything
more
than
a
pony
and
a
dogcart
aunt
louisa
had
heard
of
the
rich
uncle
but
as
he
was
married
and
had
children
before
emily
was
born
she
could
never
have
had
much
hope
of
inheriting
his
fortune
miss
wilkinson
had
little
good
to
say
of
berlin
where
she
was
now
in
a
situation
she
complained
of
the
vulgarity
of
german
life
and
compared
it
bitterly
with
the
brilliance
of
paris
where
she
had
spent
a
number
of
years
she
did
not
say
how
many
she
had
been
governess
in
the
family
of
a
fashionable
portraitpainter
who
had
married
a
jewish
wife
of
means
and
in
their
house
she
had
met
many
distinguished
people
she
dazzled
philip
with
their
names
actors
from
the
comedie
francaise
had
come
to
the
house
frequently
and
coquelin
sitting
next
her
at
dinner
had
told
her
he
had
never
met
a
foreigner
who
spoke
such
perfect
french
alphonse
daudet
had
come
also
and
he
had
given
her
a
copy
of
sappho
he
had
promised
to
write
her
name
in
it
but
she
had
forgotten
to
remind
him
she
treasured
the
volume
none
the
less
and
she
would
lend
it
to
philip
then
there
was
maupassant
miss
wilkinson
with
a
rippling
laugh
looked
at
philip
knowingly
what
a
man
but
what
a
writer
hayward
had
talked
of
maupassant
and
his
reputation
was
not
unknown
to
philip
did
he
make
love
to
you
he
asked
the
words
seemed
to
stick
funnily
in
his
throat
but
he
asked
them
nevertheless
he
liked
miss
wilkinson
very
much
now
and
was
thrilled
by
her
conversation
but
he
could
not
imagine
anyone
making
love
to
her
what
a
question
she
cried
poor
guy
he
made
love
to
every
woman
he
met
it
was
a
habit
that
he
could
not
break
himself
of
she
sighed
a
little
and
seemed
to
look
back
tenderly
on
the
past
he
was
a
charming
man
she
murmured
a
greater
experience
than
philips
would
have
guessed
from
these
words
the
probabilities
of
the
encounter
the
distinguished
writer
invited
to
luncheon
en
famille
the
governess
coming
in
sedately
with
the
two
tall
girls
she
was
teaching
the
introduction
notre
miss
anglaise
mademoiselle
and
the
luncheon
during
which
the
miss
anglaise
sat
silent
while
the
distinguished
writer
talked
to
his
host
and
hostess
but
to
philip
her
words
called
up
much
more
romantic
fancies
do
tell
me
all
about
him
he
said
excitedly
theres
nothing
to
tell
she
said
truthfully
but
in
such
a
manner
as
to
convey
that
three
volumes
would
scarcely
have
contained
the
lurid
facts
you
mustnt
be
curious
she
began
to
talk
of
paris
she
loved
the
boulevards
and
the
bois
there
was
grace
in
every
street
and
the
trees
in
the
champs
elysees
had
a
distinction
which
trees
had
not
elsewhere
they
were
sitting
on
a
stile
now
by
the
highroad
and
miss
wilkinson
looked
with
disdain
upon
the
stately
elms
in
front
of
them
and
the
theatres
the
plays
were
brilliant
and
the
acting
was
incomparable
she
often
went
with
madame
foyot
the
mother
of
the
girls
she
was
educating
when
she
was
trying
on
clothes
oh
what
a
misery
to
be
poor
she
cried
these
beautiful
things
its
only
in
paris
they
know
how
to
dress
and
not
to
be
able
to
afford
them
poor
madame
foyot
she
had
no
figure
sometimes
the
dressmaker
used
to
whisper
to
me
ah
mademoiselle
if
she
only
had
your
figure

philip
noticed
then
that
miss
wilkinson
had
a
robust
form
and
was
proud
of
it
men
are
so
stupid
in
england
they
only
think
of
the
face
the
french
who
are
a
nation
of
lovers
know
how
much
more
important
the
figure
is
philip
had
never
thought
of
such
things
before
but
he
observed
now
that
miss
wilkinsons
ankles
were
thick
and
ungainly
he
withdrew
his
eyes
quickly
you
should
go
to
france
why
dont
you
go
to
paris
for
a
year
you
would
learn
french
and
it
woulddeniaiser
you
what
is
that
asked
philip
she
laughed
slyly
you
must
look
it
out
in
the
dictionary
englishmen
do
not
know
how
to
treat
women
they
are
so
shy
shyness
is
ridiculous
in
a
man
they
dont
know
how
to
make
love
they
cant
even
tell
a
woman
she
is
charming
without
looking
foolish
philip
felt
himself
absurd
miss
wilkinson
evidently
expected
him
to
behave
very
differently
and
he
would
have
been
delighted
to
say
gallant
and
witty
things
but
they
never
occurred
to
him
and
when
they
did
he
was
too
much
afraid
of
making
a
fool
of
himself
to
say
them
oh
i
love
paris
sighed
miss
wilkinson
but
i
had
to
go
to
berlin
i
was
with
the
foyots
till
the
girls
married
and
then
i
could
get
nothing
to
do
and
i
had
the
chance
of
this
post
in
berlin
theyre
relations
of
madame
foyot
and
i
accepted
i
had
a
tiny
apartment
in
the
rue
breda
on
the
cinquieme
it
wasnt
at
all
respectable
you
know
about
the
rue
bredaces
dames
you
know
philip
nodded
not
knowing
at
all
what
she
meant
but
vaguely
suspecting
and
anxious
she
should
not
think
him
too
ignorant
but
i
didnt
care
je
suis
libre
nestce
pas
she
was
very
fond
of
speaking
french
which
indeed
she
spoke
well
once
i
had
such
a
curious
adventure
there
she
paused
a
little
and
philip
pressed
her
to
tell
it
you
wouldnt
tell
me
yours
in
heidelberg
she
said
they
were
so
unadventurous
he
retorted
i
dont
know
what
mrs
carey
would
say
if
she
knew
the
sort
of
things
we
talk
about
together
you
dont
imagine
i
shall
tell
her
will
you
promise
when
he
had
done
this
she
told
him
how
an
artstudent
who
had
a
room
on
the
floor
above
herbut
she
interrupted
herself
why
dont
you
go
in
for
art
you
paint
so
prettily
not
well
enough
for
that
that
is
for
others
to
judge
je
my
connais
and
i
believe
you
have
the
making
of
a
great
artist
cant
you
see
uncle
williams
face
if
i
suddenly
told
him
i
wanted
to
go
to
paris
and
study
art
youre
your
own
master
arent
you
youre
trying
to
put
me
off
please
go
on
with
the
story
miss
wilkinson
with
a
little
laugh
went
on
the
artstudent
had
passed
her
several
times
on
the
stairs
and
she
had
paid
no
particular
attention
she
saw
that
he
had
fine
eyes
and
he
took
off
his
hat
very
politely
and
one
day
she
found
a
letter
slipped
under
her
door
it
was
from
him
he
told
her
that
he
had
adored
her
for
months
and
that
he
waited
about
the
stairs
for
her
to
pass
oh
it
was
a
charming
letter
of
course
she
did
not
reply
but
what
woman
could
help
being
flattered
and
next
day
there
was
another
letter
it
was
wonderful
passionate
and
touching
when
next
she
met
him
on
the
stairs
she
did
not
know
which
way
to
look
and
every
day
the
letters
came
and
now
he
begged
her
to
see
him
he
said
he
would
come
in
the
evening
vers
neuf
heures
and
she
did
not
know
what
to
do
of
course
it
was
impossible
and
he
might
ring
and
ring
but
she
would
never
open
the
door
and
then
while
she
was
waiting
for
the
tinkling
of
the
bell
all
nerves
suddenly
he
stood
before
her
she
had
forgotten
to
shut
the
door
when
she
came
in
cetait
une
fatalite
and
what
happened
then
asked
philip
that
is
the
end
of
the
story
she
replied
with
a
ripple
of
laughter
philip
was
silent
for
a
moment
his
heart
beat
quickly
and
strange
emotions
seemed
to
be
hustling
one
another
in
his
heart
he
saw
the
dark
staircase
and
the
chance
meetings
and
he
admired
the
boldness
of
the
lettersoh
he
would
never
have
dared
to
do
thatand
then
the
silent
almost
mysterious
entrance
it
seemed
to
him
the
very
soul
of
romance
what
was
he
like
oh
he
was
handsome
charmant
garcon
do
you
know
him
still
philip
felt
a
slight
feeling
of
irritation
as
he
asked
this
he
treated
me
abominably
men
are
always
the
same
youre
heartless
all
of
you
i
dont
know
about
that
said
philip
not
without
embarrassment
let
us
go
home
said
miss
wilkinson
chapter
xxxiii
philip
could
not
get
miss
wilkinsons
story
out
of
his
head
it
was
clear
enough
what
she
meant
even
though
she
cut
it
short
and
he
was
a
little
shocked
that
sort
of
thing
was
all
very
well
for
married
women
he
had
read
enough
french
novels
to
know
that
in
france
it
was
indeed
the
rule
but
miss
wilkinson
was
english
and
unmarried
her
father
was
a
clergyman
then
it
struck
him
that
the
artstudent
probably
was
neither
the
first
nor
the
last
of
her
lovers
and
he
gasped
he
had
never
looked
upon
miss
wilkinson
like
that
it
seemed
incredible
that
anyone
should
make
love
to
her
in
his
ingenuousness
he
doubted
her
story
as
little
as
he
doubted
what
he
read
in
books
and
he
was
angry
that
such
wonderful
things
never
happened
to
him
it
was
humiliating
that
if
miss
wilkinson
insisted
upon
his
telling
her
of
his
adventures
in
heidelberg
he
would
have
nothing
to
tell
it
was
true
that
he
had
some
power
of
invention
but
he
was
not
sure
whether
he
could
persuade
her
that
he
was
steeped
in
vice
women
were
full
of
intuition
he
had
read
that
and
she
might
easily
discover
that
he
was
fibbing
he
blushed
scarlet
as
he
thought
of
her
laughing
up
her
sleeve
miss
wilkinson
played
the
piano
and
sang
in
a
rather
tired
voice
but
her
songs
massenet
benjamin
goddard
and
augusta
holmes
were
new
to
philip
and
together
they
spent
many
hours
at
the
piano
one
day
she
wondered
if
he
had
a
voice
and
insisted
on
trying
it
she
told
him
he
had
a
pleasant
baritone
and
offered
to
give
him
lessons
at
first
with
his
usual
bashfulness
he
refused
but
she
insisted
and
then
every
morning
at
a
convenient
time
after
breakfast
she
gave
him
an
hours
lesson
she
had
a
natural
gift
for
teaching
and
it
was
clear
that
she
was
an
excellent
governess
she
had
method
and
firmness
though
her
french
accent
was
so
much
part
of
her
that
it
remained
all
the
mellifluousness
of
her
manner
left
her
when
she
was
engaged
in
teaching
she
put
up
with
no
nonsense
her
voice
became
a
little
peremptory
and
instinctively
she
suppressed
inattention
and
corrected
slovenliness
she
knew
what
she
was
about
and
put
philip
to
scales
and
exercises
when
the
lesson
was
over
she
resumed
without
effort
her
seductive
smiles
her
voice
became
again
soft
and
winning
but
philip
could
not
so
easily
put
away
the
pupil
as
she
the
pedagogue
and
this
impression
convicted
with
the
feelings
her
stories
had
aroused
in
him
he
looked
at
her
more
narrowly
he
liked
her
much
better
in
the
evening
than
in
the
morning
in
the
morning
she
was
rather
lined
and
the
skin
of
her
neck
was
just
a
little
rough
he
wished
she
would
hide
it
but
the
weather
was
very
warm
just
then
and
she
wore
blouses
which
were
cut
low
she
was
very
fond
of
white
in
the
morning
it
did
not
suit
her
at
night
she
often
looked
very
attractive
she
put
on
a
gown
which
was
almost
a
dinner
dress
and
she
wore
a
chain
of
garnets
round
her
neck
the
lace
about
her
bosom
and
at
her
elbows
gave
her
a
pleasant
softness
and
the
scent
she
wore
at
blackstable
no
one
used
anything
but
eau
de
cologne
and
that
only
on
sundays
or
when
suffering
from
a
sick
headache
was
troubling
and
exotic
she
really
looked
very
young
then
philip
was
much
exercised
over
her
age
he
added
twenty
and
seventeen
together
and
could
not
bring
them
to
a
satisfactory
total
he
asked
aunt
louisa
more
than
once
why
she
thought
miss
wilkinson
was
thirtyseven
she
didnt
look
more
than
thirty
and
everyone
knew
that
foreigners
aged
more
rapidly
than
english
women
miss
wilkinson
had
lived
so
long
abroad
that
she
might
almost
be
called
a
foreigner
he
personally
wouldnt
have
thought
her
more
than
twentysix
shes
more
than
that
said
aunt
louisa
philip
did
not
believe
in
the
accuracy
of
the
careys
statements
all
they
distinctly
remembered
was
that
miss
wilkinson
had
not
got
her
hair
up
the
last
time
they
saw
her
in
lincolnshire
well
she
might
have
been
twelve
then
it
was
so
long
ago
and
the
vicar
was
always
so
unreliable
they
said
it
was
twenty
years
ago
but
people
used
round
figures
and
it
was
just
as
likely
to
be
eighteen
years
or
seventeen
seventeen
and
twelve
were
only
twentynine
and
hang
it
all
that
wasnt
old
was
it
cleopatra
was
fortyeight
when
antony
threw
away
the
world
for
her
sake
it
was
a
fine
summer
day
after
day
was
hot
and
cloudless
but
the
heat
was
tempered
by
the
neighbourhood
of
the
sea
and
there
was
a
pleasant
exhilaration
in
the
air
so
that
one
was
excited
and
not
oppressed
by
the
august
sunshine
there
was
a
pond
in
the
garden
in
which
a
fountain
played
water
lilies
grew
in
it
and
gold
fish
sunned
themselves
on
the
surface
philip
and
miss
wilkinson
used
to
take
rugs
and
cushions
there
after
dinner
and
lie
on
the
lawn
in
the
shade
of
a
tall
hedge
of
roses
they
talked
and
read
all
the
afternoon
they
smoked
cigarettes
which
the
vicar
did
not
allow
in
the
house
he
thought
smoking
a
disgusting
habit
and
used
frequently
to
say
that
it
was
disgraceful
for
anyone
to
grow
a
slave
to
a
habit
he
forgot
that
he
was
himself
a
slave
to
afternoon
tea
one
day
miss
wilkinson
gave
philip
la
vie
de
boheme
she
had
found
it
by
accident
when
she
was
rummaging
among
the
books
in
the
vicars
study
it
had
been
bought
in
a
lot
with
something
mr
carey
wanted
and
had
remained
undiscovered
for
ten
years
philip
began
to
read
murgers
fascinating
illwritten
absurd
masterpiece
and
fell
at
once
under
its
spell
his
soul
danced
with
joy
at
that
picture
of
starvation
which
is
so
goodhumoured
of
squalor
which
is
so
picturesque
of
sordid
love
which
is
so
romantic
of
bathos
which
is
so
moving
rodolphe
and
mimi
musette
and
schaunard
they
wander
through
the
gray
streets
of
the
latin
quarter
finding
refuge
now
in
one
attic
now
in
another
in
their
quaint
costumes
of
louis
philippe
with
their
tears
and
their
smiles
happygolucky
and
reckless
who
can
resist
them
it
is
only
when
you
return
to
the
book
with
a
sounder
judgment
that
you
find
how
gross
their
pleasures
were
how
vulgar
their
minds
and
you
feel
the
utter
worthlessness
as
artists
and
as
human
beings
of
that
gay
procession
philip
was
enraptured
dont
you
wish
you
were
going
to
paris
instead
of
london
asked
miss
wilkinson
smiling
at
his
enthusiasm
its
too
late
now
even
if
i
did
he
answered
during
the
fortnight
he
had
been
back
from
germany
there
had
been
much
discussion
between
himself
and
his
uncle
about
his
future
he
had
refused
definitely
to
go
to
oxford
and
now
that
there
was
no
chance
of
his
getting
scholarships
even
mr
carey
came
to
the
conclusion
that
he
could
not
afford
it
his
entire
fortune
had
consisted
of
only
two
thousand
pounds
and
though
it
had
been
invested
in
mortgages
at
five
per
cent
he
had
not
been
able
to
live
on
the
interest
it
was
now
a
little
reduced
it
would
be
absurd
to
spend
two
hundred
a
year
the
least
he
could
live
on
at
a
university
for
three
years
at
oxford
which
would
lead
him
no
nearer
to
earning
his
living
he
was
anxious
to
go
straight
to
london
mrs
carey
thought
there
were
only
four
professions
for
a
gentleman
the
army
the
navy
the
law
and
the
church
she
had
added
medicine
because
her
brotherinlaw
practised
it
but
did
not
forget
that
in
her
young
days
no
one
ever
considered
the
doctor
a
gentleman
the
first
two
were
out
of
the
question
and
philip
was
firm
in
his
refusal
to
be
ordained
only
the
law
remained
the
local
doctor
had
suggested
that
many
gentlemen
now
went
in
for
engineering
but
mrs
carey
opposed
the
idea
at
once
i
shouldnt
like
philip
to
go
into
trade
she
said
no
he
must
have
a
profession
answered
the
vicar
why
not
make
him
a
doctor
like
his
father
i
should
hate
it
said
philip
mrs
carey
was
not
sorry
the
bar
seemed
out
of
the
question
since
he
was
not
going
to
oxford
for
the
careys
were
under
the
impression
that
a
degree
was
still
necessary
for
success
in
that
calling
and
finally
it
was
suggested
that
he
should
become
articled
to
a
solicitor
they
wrote
to
the
family
lawyer
albert
nixon
who
was
coexecutor
with
the
vicar
of
blackstable
for
the
late
henry
careys
estate
and
asked
him
whether
he
would
take
philip
in
a
day
or
two
the
answer
came
back
that
he
had
not
a
vacancy
and
was
very
much
opposed
to
the
whole
scheme
the
profession
was
greatly
overcrowded
and
without
capital
or
connections
a
man
had
small
chance
of
becoming
more
than
a
managing
clerk
he
suggested
however
that
philip
should
become
a
chartered
accountant
neither
the
vicar
nor
his
wife
knew
in
the
least
what
this
was
and
philip
had
never
heard
of
anyone
being
a
chartered
accountant
but
another
letter
from
the
solicitor
explained
that
the
growth
of
modern
businesses
and
the
increase
of
companies
had
led
to
the
formation
of
many
firms
of
accountants
to
examine
the
books
and
put
into
the
financial
affairs
of
their
clients
an
order
which
oldfashioned
methods
had
lacked
some
years
before
a
royal
charter
had
been
obtained
and
the
profession
was
becoming
every
year
more
respectable
lucrative
and
important
the
chartered
accountants
whom
albert
nixon
had
employed
for
thirty
years
happened
to
have
a
vacancy
for
an
articled
pupil
and
would
take
philip
for
a
fee
of
three
hundred
pounds
half
of
this
would
be
returned
during
the
five
years
the
articles
lasted
in
the
form
of
salary
the
prospect
was
not
exciting
but
philip
felt
that
he
must
decide
on
something
and
the
thought
of
living
in
london
overbalanced
the
slight
shrinking
he
felt
the
vicar
of
blackstable
wrote
to
ask
mr
nixon
whether
it
was
a
profession
suited
to
a
gentleman
and
mr
nixon
replied
that
since
the
charter
men
were
going
into
it
who
had
been
to
public
schools
and
a
university
moreover
if
philip
disliked
the
work
and
after
a
year
wished
to
leave
herbert
carter
for
that
was
the
accountants
name
would
return
half
the
money
paid
for
the
articles
this
settled
it
and
it
was
arranged
that
philip
should
start
work
on
the
fifteenth
of
september
i
have
a
full
month
before
me
said
philip
and
then
you
go
to
freedom
and
i
to
bondage
returned
miss
wilkinson
her
holidays
were
to
last
six
weeks
and
she
would
be
leaving
blackstable
only
a
day
or
two
before
philip
i
wonder
if
we
shall
ever
meet
again
she
said
i
dont
know
why
not
oh
dont
speak
in
that
practical
way
i
never
knew
anyone
so
unsentimental
philip
reddened
he
was
afraid
that
miss
wilkinson
would
think
him
a
milksop
after
all
she
was
a
young
woman
sometimes
quite
pretty
and
he
was
getting
on
for
twenty
it
was
absurd
that
they
should
talk
of
nothing
but
art
and
literature
he
ought
to
make
love
to
her
they
had
talked
a
good
deal
of
love
there
was
the
artstudent
in
the
rue
breda
and
then
there
was
the
painter
in
whose
family
she
had
lived
so
long
in
paris
he
had
asked
her
to
sit
for
him
and
had
started
to
make
love
to
her
so
violently
that
she
was
forced
to
invent
excuses
not
to
sit
to
him
again
it
was
clear
enough
that
miss
wilkinson
was
used
to
attentions
of
that
sort
she
looked
very
nice
now
in
a
large
straw
hat
it
was
hot
that
afternoon
the
hottest
day
they
had
had
and
beads
of
sweat
stood
in
a
line
on
her
upper
lip
he
called
to
mind
fraulein
cacilie
and
herr
sung
he
had
never
thought
of
cacilie
in
an
amorous
way
she
was
exceedingly
plain
but
now
looking
back
the
affair
seemed
very
romantic
he
had
a
chance
of
romance
too
miss
wilkinson
was
practically
french
and
that
added
zest
to
a
possible
adventure
when
he
thought
of
it
at
night
in
bed
or
when
he
sat
by
himself
in
the
garden
reading
a
book
he
was
thrilled
by
it
but
when
he
saw
miss
wilkinson
it
seemed
less
picturesque
at
all
events
after
what
she
had
told
him
she
would
not
be
surprised
if
he
made
love
to
her
he
had
a
feeling
that
she
must
think
it
odd
of
him
to
make
no
sign
perhaps
it
was
only
his
fancy
but
once
or
twice
in
the
last
day
or
two
he
had
imagined
that
there
was
a
suspicion
of
contempt
in
her
eyes
a
penny
for
your
thoughts
said
miss
wilkinson
looking
at
him
with
a
smile
im
not
going
to
tell
you
he
answered
he
was
thinking
that
he
ought
to
kiss
her
there
and
then
he
wondered
if
she
expected
him
to
do
it
but
after
all
he
didnt
see
how
he
could
without
any
preliminary
business
at
all
she
would
just
think
him
mad
or
she
might
slap
his
face
and
perhaps
she
would
complain
to
his
uncle
he
wondered
how
herr
sung
had
started
with
fraulein
cacilie
it
would
be
beastly
if
she
told
his
uncle
he
knew
what
his
uncle
was
he
would
tell
the
doctor
and
josiah
graves
and
he
would
look
a
perfect
fool
aunt
louisa
kept
on
saying
that
miss
wilkinson
was
thirtyseven
if
she
was
a
day
he
shuddered
at
the
thought
of
the
ridicule
he
would
be
exposed
to
they
would
say
she
was
old
enough
to
be
his
mother
twopence
for
your
thoughts
smiled
miss
wilkinson
i
was
thinking
about
you
he
answered
boldly
that
at
all
events
committed
him
to
nothing
what
were
you
thinking
ah
now
you
want
to
know
too
much
naughty
boy
said
miss
wilkinson
there
it
was
again
whenever
he
had
succeeded
in
working
himself
up
she
said
something
which
reminded
him
of
the
governess
she
called
him
playfully
a
naughty
boy
when
he
did
not
sing
his
exercises
to
her
satisfaction
this
time
he
grew
quite
sulky
i
wish
you
wouldnt
treat
me
as
if
i
were
a
child
are
you
cross
very
i
didnt
mean
to
she
put
out
her
hand
and
he
took
it
once
or
twice
lately
when
they
shook
hands
at
night
he
had
fancied
she
slightly
pressed
his
hand
but
this
time
there
was
no
doubt
about
it
he
did
not
quite
know
what
he
ought
to
say
next
here
at
last
was
his
chance
of
an
adventure
and
he
would
be
a
fool
not
to
take
it
but
it
was
a
little
ordinary
and
he
had
expected
more
glamour
he
had
read
many
descriptions
of
love
and
he
felt
in
himself
none
of
that
uprush
of
emotion
which
novelists
described
he
was
not
carried
off
his
feet
in
wave
upon
wave
of
passion
nor
was
miss
wilkinson
the
ideal
he
had
often
pictured
to
himself
the
great
violet
eyes
and
the
alabaster
skin
of
some
lovely
girl
and
he
had
thought
of
himself
burying
his
face
in
the
rippling
masses
of
her
auburn
hair
he
could
not
imagine
himself
burying
his
face
in
miss
wilkinsons
hair
it
always
struck
him
as
a
little
sticky
all
the
same
it
would
be
very
satisfactory
to
have
an
intrigue
and
he
thrilled
with
the
legitimate
pride
he
would
enjoy
in
his
conquest
he
owed
it
to
himself
to
seduce
her
he
made
up
his
mind
to
kiss
miss
wilkinson
not
then
but
in
the
evening
it
would
be
easier
in
the
dark
and
after
he
had
kissed
her
the
rest
would
follow
he
would
kiss
her
that
very
evening
he
swore
an
oath
to
that
effect
he
laid
his
plans
after
supper
he
suggested
that
they
should
take
a
stroll
in
the
garden
miss
wilkinson
accepted
and
they
sauntered
side
by
side
philip
was
very
nervous
he
did
not
know
why
but
the
conversation
would
not
lead
in
the
right
direction
he
had
decided
that
the
first
thing
to
do
was
to
put
his
arm
round
her
waist
but
he
could
not
suddenly
put
his
arm
round
her
waist
when
she
was
talking
of
the
regatta
which
was
to
be
held
next
week
he
led
her
artfully
into
the
darkest
parts
of
the
garden
but
having
arrived
there
his
courage
failed
him
they
sat
on
a
bench
and
he
had
really
made
up
his
mind
that
here
was
his
opportunity
when
miss
wilkinson
said
she
was
sure
there
were
earwigs
and
insisted
on
moving
they
walked
round
the
garden
once
more
and
philip
promised
himself
he
would
take
the
plunge
before
they
arrived
at
that
bench
again
but
as
they
passed
the
house
they
saw
mrs
carey
standing
at
the
door
hadnt
you
young
people
better
come
in
im
sure
the
night
air
isnt
good
for
you
perhaps
we
had
better
go
in
said
philip
i
dont
want
you
to
catch
cold
he
said
it
with
a
sigh
of
relief
he
could
attempt
nothing
more
that
night
but
afterwards
when
he
was
alone
in
his
room
he
was
furious
with
himself
he
had
been
a
perfect
fool
he
was
certain
that
miss
wilkinson
expected
him
to
kiss
her
otherwise
she
wouldnt
have
come
into
the
garden
she
was
always
saying
that
only
frenchmen
knew
how
to
treat
women
philip
had
read
french
novels
if
he
had
been
a
frenchman
he
would
have
seized
her
in
his
arms
and
told
her
passionately
that
he
adored
her
he
would
have
pressed
his
lips
on
her
nuque
he
did
not
know
why
frenchmen
always
kissed
ladies
on
the
nuque
he
did
not
himself
see
anything
so
very
attractive
in
the
nape
of
the
neck
of
course
it
was
much
easier
for
frenchmen
to
do
these
things
the
language
was
such
an
aid
philip
could
never
help
feeling
that
to
say
passionate
things
in
english
sounded
a
little
absurd
he
wished
now
that
he
had
never
undertaken
the
siege
of
miss
wilkinsons
virtue
the
first
fortnight
had
been
so
jolly
and
now
he
was
wretched
but
he
was
determined
not
to
give
in
he
would
never
respect
himself
again
if
he
did
and
he
made
up
his
mind
irrevocably
that
the
next
night
he
would
kiss
her
without
fail
next
day
when
he
got
up
he
saw
it
was
raining
and
his
first
thought
was
that
they
would
not
be
able
to
go
into
the
garden
that
evening
he
was
in
high
spirits
at
breakfast
miss
wilkinson
sent
mary
ann
in
to
say
that
she
had
a
headache
and
would
remain
in
bed
she
did
not
come
down
till
teatime
when
she
appeared
in
a
becoming
wrapper
and
a
pale
face
but
she
was
quite
recovered
by
supper
and
the
meal
was
very
cheerful
after
prayers
she
said
she
would
go
straight
to
bed
and
she
kissed
mrs
carey
then
she
turned
to
philip
good
gracious
she
cried
i
was
just
going
to
kiss
you
too
why
dont
you
he
said
she
laughed
and
held
out
her
hand
she
distinctly
pressed
his
the
following
day
there
was
not
a
cloud
in
the
sky
and
the
garden
was
sweet
and
fresh
after
the
rain
philip
went
down
to
the
beach
to
bathe
and
when
he
came
home
ate
a
magnificent
dinner
they
were
having
a
tennis
party
at
the
vicarage
in
the
afternoon
and
miss
wilkinson
put
on
her
best
dress
she
certainly
knew
how
to
wear
her
clothes
and
philip
could
not
help
noticing
how
elegant
she
looked
beside
the
curates
wife
and
the
doctors
married
daughter
there
were
two
roses
in
her
waistband
she
sat
in
a
garden
chair
by
the
side
of
the
lawn
holding
a
red
parasol
over
herself
and
the
light
on
her
face
was
very
becoming
philip
was
fond
of
tennis
he
served
well
and
as
he
ran
clumsily
played
close
to
the
net
notwithstanding
his
clubfoot
he
was
quick
and
it
was
difficult
to
get
a
ball
past
him
he
was
pleased
because
he
won
all
his
sets
at
tea
he
lay
down
at
miss
wilkinsons
feet
hot
and
panting
flannels
suit
you
she
said
you
look
very
nice
this
afternoon
he
blushed
with
delight
i
can
honestly
return
the
compliment
you
look
perfectly
ravishing
she
smiled
and
gave
him
a
long
look
with
her
black
eyes
after
supper
he
insisted
that
she
should
come
out
havent
you
had
enough
exercise
for
one
day
itll
be
lovely
in
the
garden
tonight
the
stars
are
all
out
he
was
in
high
spirits
dyou
know
mrs
carey
has
been
scolding
me
on
your
account
said
miss
wilkinson
when
they
were
sauntering
through
the
kitchen
garden
she
says
i
mustnt
flirt
with
you
have
you
been
flirting
with
me
i
hadnt
noticed
it
she
was
only
joking
it
was
very
unkind
of
you
to
refuse
to
kiss
me
last
night
if
you
saw
the
look
your
uncle
gave
me
when
i
said
what
i
did
was
that
all
that
prevented
you
i
prefer
to
kiss
people
without
witnesses
there
are
no
witnesses
now
philip
put
his
arm
round
her
waist
and
kissed
her
lips
she
only
laughed
a
little
and
made
no
attempt
to
withdraw
it
had
come
quite
naturally
philip
was
very
proud
of
himself
he
said
he
would
and
he
had
it
was
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
he
wished
he
had
done
it
before
he
did
it
again
oh
you
mustnt
she
said
why
not
because
i
like
it
she
laughed
chapter
xxxiv
next
day
after
dinner
they
took
their
rugs
and
cushions
to
the
fountain
and
their
books
but
they
did
not
read
miss
wilkinson
made
herself
comfortable
and
she
opened
the
red
sunshade
philip
was
not
at
all
shy
now
but
at
first
she
would
not
let
him
kiss
her
it
was
very
wrong
of
me
last
night
she
said
i
couldnt
sleep
i
felt
id
done
so
wrong
what
nonsense
he
cried
im
sure
you
slept
like
a
top
what
do
you
think
your
uncle
would
say
if
he
knew
theres
no
reason
why
he
should
know
he
leaned
over
her
and
his
heart
went
pitapat
why
dyou
want
to
kiss
me
he
knew
he
ought
to
reply
because
i
love
you
but
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
say
it
why
do
you
think
he
asked
instead
she
looked
at
him
with
smiling
eyes
and
touched
his
face
with
the
tips
of
her
fingers
how
smooth
your
face
is
she
murmured
i
want
shaving
awfully
he
said
it
was
astonishing
how
difficult
he
found
it
to
make
romantic
speeches
he
found
that
silence
helped
him
much
more
than
words
he
could
look
inexpressible
things
miss
wilkinson
sighed
do
you
like
me
at
all
yes
awfully
when
he
tried
to
kiss
her
again
she
did
not
resist
he
pretended
to
be
much
more
passionate
than
he
really
was
and
he
succeeded
in
playing
a
part
which
looked
very
well
in
his
own
eyes
im
beginning
to
be
rather
frightened
of
you
said
miss
wilkinson
youll
come
out
after
supper
wont
you
he
begged
not
unless
you
promise
to
behave
yourself
ill
promise
anything
he
was
catching
fire
from
the
flame
he
was
partly
simulating
and
at
teatime
he
was
obstreperously
merry
miss
wilkinson
looked
at
him
nervously
you
mustnt
have
those
shining
eyes
she
said
to
him
afterwards
what
will
your
aunt
louisa
think
i
dont
care
what
she
thinks
miss
wilkinson
gave
a
little
laugh
of
pleasure
they
had
no
sooner
finished
supper
than
he
said
to
her
are
you
going
to
keep
me
company
while
i
smoke
a
cigarette
why
dont
you
let
miss
wilkinson
rest
said
mrs
carey
you
must
remember
shes
not
as
young
as
you
oh
id
like
to
go
out
mrs
carey
she
said
rather
acidly
after
dinner
walk
a
mile
after
supper
rest
a
while
said
the
vicar
your
aunt
is
very
nice
but
she
gets
on
my
nerves
sometimes
said
miss
wilkinson
as
soon
as
they
closed
the
sidedoor
behind
them
philip
threw
away
the
cigarette
he
had
just
lighted
and
flung
his
arms
round
her
she
tried
to
push
him
away
you
promised
youd
be
good
philip
you
didnt
think
i
was
going
to
keep
a
promise
like
that
not
so
near
the
house
philip
she
said
supposing
someone
should
come
out
suddenly
he
led
her
to
the
kitchen
garden
where
no
one
was
likely
to
come
and
this
time
miss
wilkinson
did
not
think
of
earwigs
he
kissed
her
passionately
it
was
one
of
the
things
that
puzzled
him
that
he
did
not
like
her
at
all
in
the
morning
and
only
moderately
in
the
afternoon
but
at
night
the
touch
of
her
hand
thrilled
him
he
said
things
that
he
would
never
have
thought
himself
capable
of
saying
he
could
certainly
never
have
said
them
in
the
broad
light
of
day
and
he
listened
to
himself
with
wonder
and
satisfaction
how
beautifully
you
make
love
she
said
that
was
what
he
thought
himself
oh
if
i
could
only
say
all
the
things
that
burn
my
heart
he
murmured
passionately
it
was
splendid
it
was
the
most
thrilling
game
he
had
ever
played
and
the
wonderful
thing
was
that
he
felt
almost
all
he
said
it
was
only
that
he
exaggerated
a
little
he
was
tremendously
interested
and
excited
in
the
effect
he
could
see
it
had
on
her
it
was
obviously
with
an
effort
that
at
last
she
suggested
going
in
oh
dont
go
yet
he
cried
i
must
she
muttered
im
frightened
he
had
a
sudden
intuition
what
was
the
right
thing
to
do
then
i
cant
go
in
yet
i
shall
stay
here
and
think
my
cheeks
are
burning
i
want
the
nightair
goodnight
he
held
out
his
hand
seriously
and
she
took
it
in
silence
he
thought
she
stifled
a
sob
oh
it
was
magnificent
when
after
a
decent
interval
during
which
he
had
been
rather
bored
in
the
dark
garden
by
himself
he
went
in
he
found
that
miss
wilkinson
had
already
gone
to
bed
after
that
things
were
different
between
them
the
next
day
and
the
day
after
philip
showed
himself
an
eager
lover
he
was
deliciously
flattered
to
discover
that
miss
wilkinson
was
in
love
with
him
she
told
him
so
in
english
and
she
told
him
so
in
french
she
paid
him
compliments
no
one
had
ever
informed
him
before
that
his
eyes
were
charming
and
that
he
had
a
sensual
mouth
he
had
never
bothered
much
about
his
personal
appearance
but
now
when
occasion
presented
he
looked
at
himself
in
the
glass
with
satisfaction
when
he
kissed
her
it
was
wonderful
to
feel
the
passion
that
seemed
to
thrill
her
soul
he
kissed
her
a
good
deal
for
he
found
it
easier
to
do
that
than
to
say
the
things
he
instinctively
felt
she
expected
of
him
it
still
made
him
feel
a
fool
to
say
he
worshipped
her
he
wished
there
were
someone
to
whom
he
could
boast
a
little
and
he
would
willingly
have
discussed
minute
points
of
his
conduct
sometimes
she
said
things
that
were
enigmatic
and
he
was
puzzled
he
wished
hayward
had
been
there
so
that
he
could
ask
him
what
he
thought
she
meant
and
what
he
had
better
do
next
he
could
not
make
up
his
mind
whether
he
ought
to
rush
things
or
let
them
take
their
time
there
were
only
three
weeks
more
i
cant
bear
to
think
of
that
she
said
it
breaks
my
heart
and
then
perhaps
we
shall
never
see
one
another
again
if
you
cared
for
me
at
all
you
wouldnt
be
so
unkind
to
me
he
whispered
oh
why
cant
you
be
content
to
let
it
go
on
as
it
is
men
are
always
the
same
theyre
never
satisfied
and
when
he
pressed
her
she
said
but
dont
you
see
its
impossible
how
can
we
here
he
proposed
all
sorts
of
schemes
but
she
would
not
have
anything
to
do
with
them
i
darent
take
the
risk
it
would
be
too
dreadful
if
your
aunt
found
out
a
day
or
two
later
he
had
an
idea
which
seemed
brilliant
look
here
if
you
had
a
headache
on
sunday
evening
and
offered
to
stay
at
home
and
look
after
the
house
aunt
louisa
would
go
to
church
generally
mrs
carey
remained
in
on
sunday
evening
in
order
to
allow
mary
ann
to
go
to
church
but
she
would
welcome
the
opportunity
of
attending
evensong
philip
had
not
found
it
necessary
to
impart
to
his
relations
the
change
in
his
views
on
christianity
which
had
occurred
in
germany
they
could
not
be
expected
to
understand
and
it
seemed
less
trouble
to
go
to
church
quietly
but
he
only
went
in
the
morning
he
regarded
this
as
a
graceful
concession
to
the
prejudices
of
society
and
his
refusal
to
go
a
second
time
as
an
adequate
assertion
of
free
thought
when
he
made
the
suggestion
miss
wilkinson
did
not
speak
for
a
moment
then
shook
her
head
no
i
wont
she
said
but
on
sunday
at
teatime
she
surprised
philip
i
dont
think
ill
come
to
church
this
evening
she
said
suddenly
ive
really
got
a
dreadful
headache
mrs
carey
much
concerned
insisted
on
giving
her
some
drops
which
she
was
herself
in
the
habit
of
using
miss
wilkinson
thanked
her
and
immediately
after
tea
announced
that
she
would
go
to
her
room
and
lie
down
are
you
sure
theres
nothing
youll
want
asked
mrs
carey
anxiously
quite
sure
thank
you
because
if
there
isnt
i
think
ill
go
to
church
i
dont
often
have
the
chance
of
going
in
the
evening
oh
yes
do
go
i
shall
be
in
said
philip
if
miss
wilkinson
wants
anything
she
can
always
call
me
youd
better
leave
the
drawingroom
door
open
philip
so
that
if
miss
wilkinson
rings
youll
hear
certainly
said
philip
so
after
six
oclock
philip
was
left
alone
in
the
house
with
miss
wilkinson
he
felt
sick
with
apprehension
he
wished
with
all
his
heart
that
he
had
not
suggested
the
plan
but
it
was
too
late
now
he
must
take
the
opportunity
which
he
had
made
what
would
miss
wilkinson
think
of
him
if
he
did
not
he
went
into
the
hall
and
listened
there
was
not
a
sound
he
wondered
if
miss
wilkinson
really
had
a
headache
perhaps
she
had
forgotten
his
suggestion
his
heart
beat
painfully
he
crept
up
the
stairs
as
softly
as
he
could
and
he
stopped
with
a
start
when
they
creaked
he
stood
outside
miss
wilkinsons
room
and
listened
he
put
his
hand
on
the
knob
of
the
doorhandle
he
waited
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
waited
for
at
least
five
minutes
trying
to
make
up
his
mind
and
his
hand
trembled
he
would
willingly
have
bolted
but
he
was
afraid
of
the
remorse
which
he
knew
would
seize
him
it
was
like
getting
on
the
highest
divingboard
in
a
swimmingbath
it
looked
nothing
from
below
but
when
you
got
up
there
and
stared
down
at
the
water
your
heart
sank
and
the
only
thing
that
forced
you
to
dive
was
the
shame
of
coming
down
meekly
by
the
steps
you
had
climbed
up
philip
screwed
up
his
courage
he
turned
the
handle
softly
and
walked
in
he
seemed
to
himself
to
be
trembling
like
a
leaf
miss
wilkinson
was
standing
at
the
dressingtable
with
her
back
to
the
door
and
she
turned
round
quickly
when
she
heard
it
open
oh
its
you
what
dyou
want
she
had
taken
off
her
skirt
and
blouse
and
was
standing
in
her
petticoat
it
was
short
and
only
came
down
to
the
top
of
her
boots
the
upper
part
of
it
was
black
of
some
shiny
material
and
there
was
a
red
flounce
she
wore
a
camisole
of
white
calico
with
short
arms
she
looked
grotesque
philips
heart
sank
as
he
stared
at
her
she
had
never
seemed
so
unattractive
but
it
was
too
late
now
he
closed
the
door
behind
him
and
locked
it
chapter
xxxv
philip
woke
early
next
morning
his
sleep
had
been
restless
but
when
he
stretched
his
legs
and
looked
at
the
sunshine
that
slid
through
the
venetian
blinds
making
patterns
on
the
floor
he
sighed
with
satisfaction
he
was
delighted
with
himself
he
began
to
think
of
miss
wilkinson
she
had
asked
him
to
call
her
emily
but
he
knew
not
why
he
could
not
he
always
thought
of
her
as
miss
wilkinson
since
she
chid
him
for
so
addressing
her
he
avoided
using
her
name
at
all
during
his
childhood
he
had
often
heard
a
sister
of
aunt
louisa
the
widow
of
a
naval
officer
spoken
of
as
aunt
emily
it
made
him
uncomfortable
to
call
miss
wilkinson
by
that
name
nor
could
he
think
of
any
that
would
have
suited
her
better
she
had
begun
as
miss
wilkinson
and
it
seemed
inseparable
from
his
impression
of
her
he
frowned
a
little
somehow
or
other
he
saw
her
now
at
her
worst
he
could
not
forget
his
dismay
when
she
turned
round
and
he
saw
her
in
her
camisole
and
the
short
petticoat
he
remembered
the
slight
roughness
of
her
skin
and
the
sharp
long
lines
on
the
side
of
the
neck
his
triumph
was
shortlived
he
reckoned
out
her
age
again
and
he
did
not
see
how
she
could
be
less
than
forty
it
made
the
affair
ridiculous
she
was
plain
and
old
his
quick
fancy
showed
her
to
him
wrinkled
haggard
madeup
in
those
frocks
which
were
too
showy
for
her
position
and
too
young
for
her
years
he
shuddered
he
felt
suddenly
that
he
never
wanted
to
see
her
again
he
could
not
bear
the
thought
of
kissing
her
he
was
horrified
with
himself
was
that
love
he
took
as
long
as
he
could
over
dressing
in
order
to
put
back
the
moment
of
seeing
her
and
when
at
last
he
went
into
the
diningroom
it
was
with
a
sinking
heart
prayers
were
over
and
they
were
sitting
down
at
breakfast
lazybones
miss
wilkinson
cried
gaily
he
looked
at
her
and
gave
a
little
gasp
of
relief
she
was
sitting
with
her
back
to
the
window
she
was
really
quite
nice
he
wondered
why
he
had
thought
such
things
about
her
his
selfsatisfaction
returned
to
him
he
was
taken
aback
by
the
change
in
her
she
told
him
in
a
voice
thrilling
with
emotion
immediately
after
breakfast
that
she
loved
him
and
when
a
little
later
they
went
into
the
drawingroom
for
his
singing
lesson
and
she
sat
down
on
the
musicstool
she
put
up
her
face
in
the
middle
of
a
scale
and
said
embrassemoi
when
he
bent
down
she
flung
her
arms
round
his
neck
it
was
slightly
uncomfortable
for
she
held
him
in
such
a
position
that
he
felt
rather
choked
ah
je
taime
je
taime
je
taime
she
cried
with
her
extravagantly
french
accent
philip
wished
she
would
speak
english
i
say
i
dont
know
if
its
struck
you
that
the
gardeners
quite
likely
to
pass
the
window
any
minute
ah
je
men
fiche
du
jardinier
je
men
refiche
et
je
men
contrefiche
philip
thought
it
was
very
like
a
french
novel
and
he
did
not
know
why
it
slightly
irritated
him
at
last
he
said
well
i
think
ill
tootle
along
to
the
beach
and
have
a
dip
oh
youre
not
going
to
leave
me
this
morningof
all
mornings
philip
did
not
quite
know
why
he
should
not
but
it
did
not
matter
would
you
like
me
to
stay
he
smiled
oh
you
darling
but
no
go
go
i
want
to
think
of
you
mastering
the
salt
sea
waves
bathing
your
limbs
in
the
broad
ocean
he
got
his
hat
and
sauntered
off
what
rot
women
talk
he
thought
to
himself
but
he
was
pleased
and
happy
and
flattered
she
was
evidently
frightfully
gone
on
him
as
he
limped
along
the
high
street
of
blackstable
he
looked
with
a
tinge
of
superciliousness
at
the
people
he
passed
he
knew
a
good
many
to
nod
to
and
as
he
gave
them
a
smile
of
recognition
he
thought
to
himself
if
they
only
knew
he
did
want
someone
to
know
very
badly
he
thought
he
would
write
to
hayward
and
in
his
mind
composed
the
letter
he
would
talk
of
the
garden
and
the
roses
and
the
little
french
governess
like
an
exotic
flower
amongst
them
scented
and
perverse
he
would
say
she
was
french
becausewell
she
had
lived
in
france
so
long
that
she
almost
was
and
besides
it
would
be
shabby
to
give
the
whole
thing
away
too
exactly
dont
you
know
and
he
would
tell
hayward
how
he
had
seen
her
first
in
her
pretty
muslin
dress
and
of
the
flower
she
had
given
him
he
made
a
delicate
idyl
of
it
the
sunshine
and
the
sea
gave
it
passion
and
magic
and
the
stars
added
poetry
and
the
old
vicarage
garden
was
a
fit
and
exquisite
setting
there
was
something
meredithian
about
it
it
was
not
quite
lucy
feverel
and
not
quite
clara
middleton
but
it
was
inexpressibly
charming
philips
heart
beat
quickly
he
was
so
delighted
with
his
fancies
that
he
began
thinking
of
them
again
as
soon
as
he
crawled
back
dripping
and
cold
into
his
bathingmachine
he
thought
of
the
object
of
his
affections
she
had
the
most
adorable
little
nose
and
large
brown
eyeshe
would
describe
her
to
haywardand
masses
of
soft
brown
hair
the
sort
of
hair
it
was
delicious
to
bury
your
face
in
and
a
skin
which
was
like
ivory
and
sunshine
and
her
cheek
was
like
a
red
red
rose
how
old
was
she
eighteen
perhaps
and
he
called
her
musette
her
laughter
was
like
a
rippling
brook
and
her
voice
was
so
soft
so
low
it
was
the
sweetest
music
he
had
ever
heard
what
are
you
thinking
about
philip
stopped
suddenly
he
was
walking
slowly
home
ive
been
waving
at
you
for
the
last
quarter
of
a
mile
you
are
absentminded
miss
wilkinson
was
standing
in
front
of
him
laughing
at
his
surprise
i
thought
id
come
and
meet
you
thats
awfully
nice
of
you
he
said
did
i
startle
you
you
did
a
bit
he
admitted
he
wrote
his
letter
to
hayward
all
the
same
there
were
eight
pages
of
it
the
fortnight
that
remained
passed
quickly
and
though
each
evening
when
they
went
into
the
garden
after
supper
miss
wilkinson
remarked
that
one
day
more
had
gone
philip
was
in
too
cheerful
spirits
to
let
the
thought
depress
him
one
night
miss
wilkinson
suggested
that
it
would
be
delightful
if
she
could
exchange
her
situation
in
berlin
for
one
in
london
then
they
could
see
one
another
constantly
philip
said
it
would
be
very
jolly
but
the
prospect
aroused
no
enthusiasm
in
him
he
was
looking
forward
to
a
wonderful
life
in
london
and
he
preferred
not
to
be
hampered
he
spoke
a
little
too
freely
of
all
he
meant
to
do
and
allowed
miss
wilkinson
to
see
that
already
he
was
longing
to
be
off
you
wouldnt
talk
like
that
if
you
loved
me
she
cried
he
was
taken
aback
and
remained
silent
what
a
fool
ive
been
she
muttered
to
his
surprise
he
saw
that
she
was
crying
he
had
a
tender
heart
and
hated
to
see
anyone
miserable
oh
im
awfully
sorry
what
have
i
done
dont
cry
oh
philip
dont
leave
me
you
dont
know
what
you
mean
to
me
i
have
such
a
wretched
life
and
youve
made
me
so
happy
he
kissed
her
silently
there
really
was
anguish
in
her
tone
and
he
was
frightened
it
had
never
occurred
to
him
that
she
meant
what
she
said
quite
quite
seriously
im
awfully
sorry
you
know
im
frightfully
fond
of
you
i
wish
you
would
come
to
london
you
know
i
cant
places
are
almost
impossible
to
get
and
i
hate
english
life
almost
unconscious
that
he
was
acting
a
part
moved
by
her
distress
he
pressed
her
more
and
more
her
tears
vaguely
flattered
him
and
he
kissed
her
with
real
passion
but
a
day
or
two
later
she
made
a
real
scene
there
was
a
tennisparty
at
the
vicarage
and
two
girls
came
daughters
of
a
retired
major
in
an
indian
regiment
who
had
lately
settled
in
blackstable
they
were
very
pretty
one
was
philips
age
and
the
other
was
a
year
or
two
younger
being
used
to
the
society
of
young
men
they
were
full
of
stories
of
hillstations
in
india
and
at
that
time
the
stories
of
rudyard
kipling
were
in
every
hand
they
began
to
chaff
philip
gaily
and
he
pleased
with
the
noveltythe
young
ladies
at
blackstable
treated
the
vicars
nephew
with
a
certain
seriousnesswas
gay
and
jolly
some
devil
within
him
prompted
him
to
start
a
violent
flirtation
with
them
both
and
as
he
was
the
only
young
man
there
they
were
quite
willing
to
meet
him
halfway
it
happened
that
they
played
tennis
quite
well
and
philip
was
tired
of
patball
with
miss
wilkinson
she
had
only
begun
to
play
when
she
came
to
blackstable
so
when
he
arranged
the
sets
after
tea
he
suggested
that
miss
wilkinson
should
play
against
the
curates
wife
with
the
curate
as
her
partner
and
he
would
play
later
with
the
newcomers
he
sat
down
by
the
elder
miss
oconnor
and
said
to
her
in
an
undertone
well
get
the
duffers
out
of
the
way
first
and
then
well
have
a
jolly
set
afterwards
apparently
miss
wilkinson
overheard
him
for
she
threw
down
her
racket
and
saying
she
had
a
headache
went
away
it
was
plain
to
everyone
that
she
was
offended
philip
was
annoyed
that
she
should
make
the
fact
public
the
set
was
arranged
without
her
but
presently
mrs
carey
called
him
philip
youve
hurt
emilys
feelings
shes
gone
to
her
room
and
shes
crying
what
about
oh
something
about
a
duffers
set
do
go
to
her
and
say
you
didnt
mean
to
be
unkind
theres
a
good
boy
all
right
he
knocked
at
miss
wilkinsons
door
but
receiving
no
answer
went
in
he
found
her
lying
face
downwards
on
her
bed
weeping
he
touched
her
on
the
shoulder
i
say
what
on
earths
the
matter
leave
me
alone
i
never
want
to
speak
to
you
again
what
have
i
done
im
awfully
sorry
if
ive
hurt
your
feelings
i
didnt
mean
to
i
say
do
get
up
oh
im
so
unhappy
how
could
you
be
cruel
to
me
you
know
i
hate
that
stupid
game
i
only
play
because
i
want
to
play
with
you
she
got
up
and
walked
towards
the
dressingtable
but
after
a
quick
look
in
the
glass
sank
into
a
chair
she
made
her
handkerchief
into
a
ball
and
dabbed
her
eyes
with
it
ive
given
you
the
greatest
thing
a
woman
can
give
a
manoh
what
a
fool
i
wasand
you
have
no
gratitude
you
must
be
quite
heartless
how
could
you
be
so
cruel
as
to
torment
me
by
flirting
with
those
vulgar
girls
weve
only
got
just
over
a
week
cant
you
even
give
me
that
philip
stood
over
her
rather
sulkily
he
thought
her
behaviour
childish
he
was
vexed
with
her
for
having
shown
her
illtemper
before
strangers
but
you
know
i
dont
care
twopence
about
either
of
the
oconnors
why
on
earth
should
you
think
i
do
miss
wilkinson
put
away
her
handkerchief
her
tears
had
made
marks
on
her
powdered
face
and
her
hair
was
somewhat
disarranged
her
white
dress
did
not
suit
her
very
well
just
then
she
looked
at
philip
with
hungry
passionate
eyes
because
youre
twenty
and
sos
she
she
said
hoarsely
and
im
old
philip
reddened
and
looked
away
the
anguish
of
her
tone
made
him
feel
strangely
uneasy
he
wished
with
all
his
heart
that
he
had
never
had
anything
to
do
with
miss
wilkinson
i
dont
want
to
make
you
unhappy
he
said
awkwardly
youd
better
go
down
and
look
after
your
friends
theyll
wonder
what
has
become
of
you
all
right
he
was
glad
to
leave
her
the
quarrel
was
quickly
followed
by
a
reconciliation
but
the
few
days
that
remained
were
sometimes
irksome
to
philip
he
wanted
to
talk
of
nothing
but
the
future
and
the
future
invariably
reduced
miss
wilkinson
to
tears
at
first
her
weeping
affected
him
and
feeling
himself
a
beast
he
redoubled
his
protestations
of
undying
passion
but
now
it
irritated
him
it
would
have
been
all
very
well
if
she
had
been
a
girl
but
it
was
silly
of
a
grownup
woman
to
cry
so
much
she
never
ceased
reminding
him
that
he
was
under
a
debt
of
gratitude
to
her
which
he
could
never
repay
he
was
willing
to
acknowledge
this
since
she
made
a
point
of
it
but
he
did
not
really
know
why
he
should
be
any
more
grateful
to
her
than
she
to
him
he
was
expected
to
show
his
sense
of
obligation
in
ways
which
were
rather
a
nuisance
he
had
been
a
good
deal
used
to
solitude
and
it
was
a
necessity
to
him
sometimes
but
miss
wilkinson
looked
upon
it
as
an
unkindness
if
he
was
not
always
at
her
beck
and
call
the
miss
oconnors
asked
them
both
to
tea
and
philip
would
have
liked
to
go
but
miss
wilkinson
said
she
only
had
five
days
more
and
wanted
him
entirely
to
herself
it
was
flattering
but
a
bore
miss
wilkinson
told
him
stories
of
the
exquisite
delicacy
of
frenchmen
when
they
stood
in
the
same
relation
to
fair
ladies
as
he
to
miss
wilkinson
she
praised
their
courtesy
their
passion
for
selfsacrifice
their
perfect
tact
miss
wilkinson
seemed
to
want
a
great
deal
philip
listened
to
her
enumeration
of
the
qualities
which
must
be
possessed
by
the
perfect
lover
and
he
could
not
help
feeling
a
certain
satisfaction
that
she
lived
in
berlin
you
will
write
to
me
wont
you
write
to
me
every
day
i
want
to
know
everything
youre
doing
you
must
keep
nothing
from
me
i
shall
be
awfully
busy
he
answered
ill
write
as
often
as
i
can
she
flung
her
arms
passionately
round
his
neck
he
was
embarrassed
sometimes
by
the
demonstrations
of
her
affection
he
would
have
preferred
her
to
be
more
passive
it
shocked
him
a
little
that
she
should
give
him
so
marked
a
lead
it
did
not
tally
altogether
with
his
prepossessions
about
the
modesty
of
the
feminine
temperament
at
length
the
day
came
on
which
miss
wilkinson
was
to
go
and
she
came
down
to
breakfast
pale
and
subdued
in
a
serviceable
travelling
dress
of
black
and
white
check
she
looked
a
very
competent
governess
philip
was
silent
too
for
he
did
not
quite
know
what
to
say
that
would
fit
the
circumstance
and
he
was
terribly
afraid
that
if
he
said
something
flippant
miss
wilkinson
would
break
down
before
his
uncle
and
make
a
scene
they
had
said
their
last
goodbye
to
one
another
in
the
garden
the
night
before
and
philip
was
relieved
that
there
was
now
no
opportunity
for
them
to
be
alone
he
remained
in
the
diningroom
after
breakfast
in
case
miss
wilkinson
should
insist
on
kissing
him
on
the
stairs
he
did
not
want
mary
ann
now
a
woman
hard
upon
middle
age
with
a
sharp
tongue
to
catch
them
in
a
compromising
position
mary
ann
did
not
like
miss
wilkinson
and
called
her
an
old
cat
aunt
louisa
was
not
very
well
and
could
not
come
to
the
station
but
the
vicar
and
philip
saw
her
off
just
as
the
train
was
leaving
she
leaned
out
and
kissed
mr
carey
i
must
kiss
you
too
philip
she
said
all
right
he
said
blushing
he
stood
up
on
the
step
and
she
kissed
him
quickly
the
train
started
and
miss
wilkinson
sank
into
the
corner
of
her
carriage
and
wept
disconsolately
philip
as
he
walked
back
to
the
vicarage
felt
a
distinct
sensation
of
relief
well
did
you
see
her
safely
off
asked
aunt
louisa
when
they
got
in
yes
she
seemed
rather
weepy
she
insisted
on
kissing
me
and
philip
oh
well
at
her
age
its
not
dangerous
mrs
carey
pointed
to
the
sideboard
theres
a
letter
for
you
philip
it
came
by
the
second
post
it
was
from
hayward
and
ran
as
follows
my
dear
boy
i
answer
your
letter
at
once
i
ventured
to
read
it
to
a
great
friend
of
mine
a
charming
woman
whose
help
and
sympathy
have
been
very
precious
to
me
a
woman
withal
with
a
real
feeling
for
art
and
literature
and
we
agreed
that
it
was
charming
you
wrote
from
your
heart
and
you
do
not
know
the
delightful
naivete
which
is
in
every
line
and
because
you
love
you
write
like
a
poet
ah
dear
boy
that
is
the
real
thing
i
felt
the
glow
of
your
young
passion
and
your
prose
was
musical
from
the
sincerity
of
your
emotion
you
must
be
happy
i
wish
i
could
have
been
present
unseen
in
that
enchanted
garden
while
you
wandered
hand
in
hand
like
daphnis
and
chloe
amid
the
flowers
i
can
see
you
my
daphnis
with
the
light
of
young
love
in
your
eyes
tender
enraptured
and
ardent
while
chloe
in
your
arms
so
young
and
soft
and
fresh
vowing
she
would
neer
consentconsented
roses
and
violets
and
honeysuckle
oh
my
friend
i
envy
you
it
is
so
good
to
think
that
your
first
love
should
have
been
pure
poetry
treasure
the
moments
for
the
immortal
gods
have
given
you
the
greatest
gift
of
all
and
it
will
be
a
sweet
sad
memory
till
your
dying
day
you
will
never
again
enjoy
that
careless
rapture
first
love
is
best
love
and
she
is
beautiful
and
you
are
young
and
all
the
world
is
yours
i
felt
my
pulse
go
faster
when
with
your
adorable
simplicity
you
told
me
that
you
buried
your
face
in
her
long
hair
i
am
sure
that
it
is
that
exquisite
chestnut
which
seems
just
touched
with
gold
i
would
have
you
sit
under
a
leafy
tree
side
by
side
and
read
together
romeo
and
juliet
and
then
i
would
have
you
fall
on
your
knees
and
on
my
behalf
kiss
the
ground
on
which
her
foot
has
left
its
imprint
then
tell
her
it
is
the
homage
of
a
poet
to
her
radiant
youth
and
to
your
love
for
her
yours
always
g
etheridge
hayward
what
damned
rot
said
philip
when
he
finished
the
letter
miss
wilkinson
oddly
enough
had
suggested
that
they
should
read
romeo
and
juliet
together
but
philip
had
firmly
declined
then
as
he
put
the
letter
in
his
pocket
he
felt
a
queer
little
pang
of
bitterness
because
reality
seemed
so
different
from
the
ideal
chapter
xxxvi
a
few
days
later
philip
went
to
london
the
curate
had
recommended
rooms
in
barnes
and
these
philip
engaged
by
letter
at
fourteen
shillings
a
week
he
reached
them
in
the
evening
and
the
landlady
a
funny
little
old
woman
with
a
shrivelled
body
and
a
deeply
wrinkled
face
had
prepared
high
tea
for
him
most
of
the
sittingroom
was
taken
up
by
the
sideboard
and
a
square
table
against
one
wall
was
a
sofa
covered
with
horsehair
and
by
the
fireplace
an
armchair
to
match
there
was
a
white
antimacassar
over
the
back
of
it
and
on
the
seat
because
the
springs
were
broken
a
hard
cushion
after
having
his
tea
he
unpacked
and
arranged
his
books
then
he
sat
down
and
tried
to
read
but
he
was
depressed
the
silence
in
the
street
made
him
slightly
uncomfortable
and
he
felt
very
much
alone
next
day
he
got
up
early
he
put
on
his
tailcoat
and
the
tall
hat
which
he
had
worn
at
school
but
it
was
very
shabby
and
he
made
up
his
mind
to
stop
at
the
stores
on
his
way
to
the
office
and
buy
a
new
one
when
he
had
done
this
he
found
himself
in
plenty
of
time
and
so
walked
along
the
strand
the
office
of
messrs
herbert
carter

co
was
in
a
little
street
off
chancery
lane
and
he
had
to
ask
his
way
two
or
three
times
he
felt
that
people
were
staring
at
him
a
great
deal
and
once
he
took
off
his
hat
to
see
whether
by
chance
the
label
had
been
left
on
when
he
arrived
he
knocked
at
the
door
but
no
one
answered
and
looking
at
his
watch
he
found
it
was
barely
half
past
nine
he
supposed
he
was
too
early
he
went
away
and
ten
minutes
later
returned
to
find
an
officeboy
with
a
long
nose
pimply
face
and
a
scotch
accent
opening
the
door
philip
asked
for
mr
herbert
carter
he
had
not
come
yet
when
will
he
be
here
between
ten
and
half
past
id
better
wait
said
philip
what
are
you
wanting
asked
the
officeboy
philip
was
nervous
but
tried
to
hide
the
fact
by
a
jocose
manner
well
im
going
to
work
here
if
you
have
no
objection
oh
youre
the
new
articled
clerk
youd
better
come
in
mr
goodworthyll
be
here
in
a
while
philip
walked
in
and
as
he
did
so
saw
the
officeboyhe
was
about
the
same
age
as
philip
and
called
himself
a
junior
clerklook
at
his
foot
he
flushed
and
sitting
down
hid
it
behind
the
other
he
looked
round
the
room
it
was
dark
and
very
dingy
it
was
lit
by
a
skylight
there
were
three
rows
of
desks
in
it
and
against
them
high
stools
over
the
chimneypiece
was
a
dirty
engraving
of
a
prizefight
presently
a
clerk
came
in
and
then
another
they
glanced
at
philip
and
in
an
undertone
asked
the
officeboy
philip
found
his
name
was
macdougal
who
he
was
a
whistle
blew
and
macdougal
got
up
mr
goodworthys
come
hes
the
managing
clerk
shall
i
tell
him
youre
here
yes
please
said
philip
the
officeboy
went
out
and
in
a
moment
returned
will
you
come
this
way
philip
followed
him
across
the
passage
and
was
shown
into
a
room
small
and
barely
furnished
in
which
a
little
thin
man
was
standing
with
his
back
to
the
fireplace
he
was
much
below
the
middle
height
but
his
large
head
which
seemed
to
hang
loosely
on
his
body
gave
him
an
odd
ungainliness
his
features
were
wide
and
flattened
and
he
had
prominent
pale
eyes
his
thin
hair
was
sandy
he
wore
whiskers
that
grew
unevenly
on
his
face
and
in
places
where
you
would
have
expected
the
hair
to
grow
thickly
there
was
no
hair
at
all
his
skin
was
pasty
and
yellow
he
held
out
his
hand
to
philip
and
when
he
smiled
showed
badly
decayed
teeth
he
spoke
with
a
patronising
and
at
the
same
time
a
timid
air
as
though
he
sought
to
assume
an
importance
which
he
did
not
feel
he
said
he
hoped
philip
would
like
the
work
there
was
a
good
deal
of
drudgery
about
it
but
when
you
got
used
to
it
it
was
interesting
and
one
made
money
that
was
the
chief
thing
wasnt
it
he
laughed
with
his
odd
mixture
of
superiority
and
shyness
mr
carter
will
be
here
presently
he
said
hes
a
little
late
on
monday
mornings
sometimes
ill
call
you
when
he
comes
in
the
meantime
i
must
give
you
something
to
do
do
you
know
anything
about
bookkeeping
or
accounts
im
afraid
not
answered
philip
i
didnt
suppose
you
would
they
dont
teach
you
things
at
school
that
are
much
use
in
business
im
afraid
he
considered
for
a
moment
i
think
i
can
find
you
something
to
do
he
went
into
the
next
room
and
after
a
little
while
came
out
with
a
large
cardboard
box
it
contained
a
vast
number
of
letters
in
great
disorder
and
he
told
philip
to
sort
them
out
and
arrange
them
alphabetically
according
to
the
names
of
the
writers
ill
take
you
to
the
room
in
which
the
articled
clerk
generally
sits
theres
a
very
nice
fellow
in
it
his
name
is
watson
hes
a
son
of
watson
crag
and
thompsonyou
knowthe
brewers
hes
spending
a
year
with
us
to
learn
business
mr
goodworthy
led
philip
through
the
dingy
office
where
now
six
or
eight
clerks
were
working
into
a
narrow
room
behind
it
had
been
made
into
a
separate
apartment
by
a
glass
partition
and
here
they
found
watson
sitting
back
in
a
chair
reading
the
sportsman
he
was
a
large
stout
young
man
elegantly
dressed
and
he
looked
up
as
mr
goodworthy
entered
he
asserted
his
position
by
calling
the
managing
clerk
goodworthy
the
managing
clerk
objected
to
the
familiarity
and
pointedly
called
him
mr
watson
but
watson
instead
of
seeing
that
it
was
a
rebuke
accepted
the
title
as
a
tribute
to
his
gentlemanliness
i
see
theyve
scratched
rigoletto
he
said
to
philip
as
soon
as
they
were
left
alone
have
they
said
philip
who
knew
nothing
about
horseracing
he
looked
with
awe
upon
watsons
beautiful
clothes
his
tailcoat
fitted
him
perfectly
and
there
was
a
valuable
pin
artfully
stuck
in
the
middle
of
an
enormous
tie
on
the
chimneypiece
rested
his
tall
hat
it
was
saucy
and
bellshaped
and
shiny
philip
felt
himself
very
shabby
watson
began
to
talk
of
huntingit
was
such
an
infernal
bore
having
to
waste
ones
time
in
an
infernal
office
he
would
only
be
able
to
hunt
on
saturdaysand
shooting
he
had
ripping
invitations
all
over
the
country
and
of
course
he
had
to
refuse
them
it
was
infernal
luck
but
he
wasnt
going
to
put
up
with
it
long
he
was
only
in
this
internal
hole
for
a
year
and
then
he
was
going
into
the
business
and
he
would
hunt
four
days
a
week
and
get
all
the
shooting
there
was
youve
got
five
years
of
it
havent
you
he
said
waving
his
arm
round
the
tiny
room
i
suppose
so
said
philip
i
daresay
i
shall
see
something
of
you
carter
does
our
accounts
you
know
philip
was
somewhat
overpowered
by
the
young
gentlemans
condescension
at
blackstable
they
had
always
looked
upon
brewing
with
civil
contempt
the
vicar
made
little
jokes
about
the
beerage
and
it
was
a
surprising
experience
for
philip
to
discover
that
watson
was
such
an
important
and
magnificent
fellow
he
had
been
to
winchester
and
to
oxford
and
his
conversation
impressed
the
fact
upon
one
with
frequency
when
he
discovered
the
details
of
philips
education
his
manner
became
more
patronising
still
of
course
if
one
doesnt
go
to
a
public
school
those
sort
of
schools
are
the
next
best
thing
arent
they
philip
asked
about
the
other
men
in
the
office
oh
i
dont
bother
about
them
much
you
know
said
watson
carters
not
a
bad
sort
we
have
him
to
dine
now
and
then
all
the
rest
are
awful
bounders
presently
watson
applied
himself
to
some
work
he
had
in
hand
and
philip
set
about
sorting
his
letters
then
mr
goodworthy
came
in
to
say
that
mr
carter
had
arrived
he
took
philip
into
a
large
room
next
door
to
his
own
there
was
a
big
desk
in
it
and
a
couple
of
big
armchairs
a
turkey
carpet
adorned
the
floor
and
the
walls
were
decorated
with
sporting
prints
mr
carter
was
sitting
at
the
desk
and
got
up
to
shake
hands
with
philip
he
was
dressed
in
a
long
frock
coat
he
looked
like
a
military
man
his
moustache
was
waxed
his
gray
hair
was
short
and
nut
he
held
himself
upright
he
talked
in
a
breezy
way
he
lived
at
enfield
he
was
very
keen
on
games
and
the
good
of
the
country
he
was
an
officer
in
the
hertfordshire
yeomanry
and
chairman
of
the
conservative
association
when
he
was
told
that
a
local
magnate
had
said
no
one
would
take
him
for
a
city
man
he
felt
that
he
had
not
lived
in
vain
he
talked
to
philip
in
a
pleasant
offhand
fashion
mr
goodworthy
would
look
after
him
watson
was
a
nice
fellow
perfect
gentleman
good
sportsmandid
philip
hunt
pity
the
sport
for
gentlemen
didnt
have
much
chance
of
hunting
now
had
to
leave
that
to
his
son
his
son
was
at
cambridge
hed
sent
him
to
rugby
fine
school
rugby
nice
class
of
boys
there
in
a
couple
of
years
his
son
would
be
articled
that
would
be
nice
for
philip
hed
like
his
son
thorough
sportsman
he
hoped
philip
would
get
on
well
and
like
the
work
he
mustnt
miss
his
lectures
they
were
getting
up
the
tone
of
the
profession
they
wanted
gentlemen
in
it
well
well
mr
goodworthy
was
there
if
he
wanted
to
know
anything
mr
goodworthy
would
tell
him
what
was
his
handwriting
like
ah
well
mr
goodworthy
would
see
about
that
philip
was
overwhelmed
by
so
much
gentlemanliness
in
east
anglia
they
knew
who
were
gentlemen
and
who
werent
but
the
gentlemen
didnt
talk
about
it
chapter
xxxvii
at
first
the
novelty
of
the
work
kept
philip
interested
mr
carter
dictated
letters
to
him
and
he
had
to
make
fair
copies
of
statements
of
accounts
mr
carter
preferred
to
conduct
the
office
on
gentlemanly
lines
he
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
typewriting
and
looked
upon
shorthand
with
disfavour
the
officeboy
knew
shorthand
but
it
was
only
mr
goodworthy
who
made
use
of
his
accomplishment
now
and
then
philip
with
one
of
the
more
experienced
clerks
went
out
to
audit
the
accounts
of
some
firm
he
came
to
know
which
of
the
clients
must
be
treated
with
respect
and
which
were
in
low
water
now
and
then
long
lists
of
figures
were
given
him
to
add
up
he
attended
lectures
for
his
first
examination
mr
goodworthy
repeated
to
him
that
the
work
was
dull
at
first
but
he
would
grow
used
to
it
philip
left
the
office
at
six
and
walked
across
the
river
to
waterloo
his
supper
was
waiting
for
him
when
he
reached
his
lodgings
and
he
spent
the
evening
reading
on
saturday
afternoons
he
went
to
the
national
gallery
hayward
had
recommended
to
him
a
guide
which
had
been
compiled
out
of
ruskins
works
and
with
this
in
hand
he
went
industriously
through
room
after
room
he
read
carefully
what
the
critic
had
said
about
a
picture
and
then
in
a
determined
fashion
set
himself
to
see
the
same
things
in
it
his
sundays
were
difficult
to
get
through
he
knew
no
one
in
london
and
spent
them
by
himself
mr
nixon
the
solicitor
asked
him
to
spend
a
sunday
at
hampstead
and
philip
passed
a
happy
day
with
a
set
of
exuberant
strangers
he
ate
and
drank
a
great
deal
took
a
walk
on
the
heath
and
came
away
with
a
general
invitation
to
come
again
whenever
he
liked
but
he
was
morbidly
afraid
of
being
in
the
way
so
waited
for
a
formal
invitation
naturally
enough
it
never
came
for
with
numbers
of
friends
of
their
own
the
nixons
did
not
think
of
the
lonely
silent
boy
whose
claim
upon
their
hospitality
was
so
small
so
on
sundays
he
got
up
late
and
took
a
walk
along
the
towpath
at
barnes
the
river
is
muddy
dingy
and
tidal
it
has
neither
the
graceful
charm
of
the
thames
above
the
locks
nor
the
romance
of
the
crowded
stream
below
london
bridge
in
the
afternoon
he
walked
about
the
common
and
that
is
gray
and
dingy
too
it
is
neither
country
nor
town
the
gorse
is
stunted
and
all
about
is
the
litter
of
civilisation
he
went
to
a
play
every
saturday
night
and
stood
cheerfully
for
an
hour
or
more
at
the
gallerydoor
it
was
not
worth
while
to
go
back
to
barnes
for
the
interval
between
the
closing
of
the
museum
and
his
meal
in
an
a
b
c
shop
and
the
time
hung
heavily
on
his
hands
he
strolled
up
bond
street
or
through
the
burlington
arcade
and
when
he
was
tired
went
and
sat
down
in
the
park
or
in
wet
weather
in
the
public
library
in
st
martins
lane
he
looked
at
the
people
walking
about
and
envied
them
because
they
had
friends
sometimes
his
envy
turned
to
hatred
because
they
were
happy
and
he
was
miserable
he
had
never
imagined
that
it
was
possible
to
be
so
lonely
in
a
great
city
sometimes
when
he
was
standing
at
the
gallerydoor
the
man
next
to
him
would
attempt
a
conversation
but
philip
had
the
country
boys
suspicion
of
strangers
and
answered
in
such
a
way
as
to
prevent
any
further
acquaintance
after
the
play
was
over
obliged
to
keep
to
himself
all
he
thought
about
it
he
hurried
across
the
bridge
to
waterloo
when
he
got
back
to
his
rooms
in
which
for
economy
no
fire
had
been
lit
his
heart
sank
it
was
horribly
cheerless
he
began
to
loathe
his
lodgings
and
the
long
solitary
evenings
he
spent
in
them
sometimes
he
felt
so
lonely
that
he
could
not
read
and
then
he
sat
looking
into
the
fire
hour
after
hour
in
bitter
wretchedness
he
had
spent
three
months
in
london
now
and
except
for
that
one
sunday
at
hampstead
had
never
talked
to
anyone
but
his
fellowclerks
one
evening
watson
asked
him
to
dinner
at
a
restaurant
and
they
went
to
a
musichall
together
but
he
felt
shy
and
uncomfortable
watson
talked
all
the
time
of
things
he
did
not
care
about
and
while
he
looked
upon
watson
as
a
philistine
he
could
not
help
admiring
him
he
was
angry
because
watson
obviously
set
no
store
on
his
culture
and
with
his
way
of
taking
himself
at
the
estimate
at
which
he
saw
others
held
him
he
began
to
despise
the
acquirements
which
till
then
had
seemed
to
him
not
unimportant
he
felt
for
the
first
time
the
humiliation
of
poverty
his
uncle
sent
him
fourteen
pounds
a
month
and
he
had
had
to
buy
a
good
many
clothes
his
evening
suit
cost
him
five
guineas
he
had
not
dared
tell
watson
that
it
was
bought
in
the
strand
watson
said
there
was
only
one
tailor
in
london
i
suppose
you
dont
dance
said
watson
one
day
with
a
glance
at
philips
clubfoot
no
said
philip
pity
ive
been
asked
to
bring
some
dancing
men
to
a
ball
i
could
have
introduced
you
to
some
jolly
girls
once
or
twice
hating
the
thought
of
going
back
to
barnes
philip
had
remained
in
town
and
late
in
the
evening
wandered
through
the
west
end
till
he
found
some
house
at
which
there
was
a
party
he
stood
among
the
little
group
of
shabby
people
behind
the
footmen
watching
the
guests
arrive
and
he
listened
to
the
music
that
floated
through
the
window
sometimes
notwithstanding
the
cold
a
couple
came
on
to
the
balcony
and
stood
for
a
moment
to
get
some
fresh
air
and
philip
imagining
that
they
were
in
love
with
one
another
turned
away
and
limped
along
the
street
with
a
heavy
hurt
he
would
never
be
able
to
stand
in
that
mans
place
he
felt
that
no
woman
could
ever
really
look
upon
him
without
distaste
for
his
deformity
that
reminded
him
of
miss
wilkinson
he
thought
of
her
without
satisfaction
before
parting
they
had
made
an
arrangement
that
she
should
write
to
charing
cross
post
office
till
he
was
able
to
send
her
an
address
and
when
he
went
there
he
found
three
letters
from
her
she
wrote
on
blue
paper
with
violet
ink
and
she
wrote
in
french
philip
wondered
why
she
could
not
write
in
english
like
a
sensible
woman
and
her
passionate
expressions
because
they
reminded
him
of
a
french
novel
left
him
cold
she
upbraided
him
for
not
having
written
and
when
he
answered
he
excused
himself
by
saying
that
he
had
been
busy
he
did
not
quite
know
how
to
start
the
letter
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
use
dearest
or
darling
and
he
hated
to
address
her
as
emily
so
finally
he
began
with
the
word
dear
it
looked
odd
standing
by
itself
and
rather
silly
but
he
made
it
do
it
was
the
first
love
letter
he
had
ever
written
and
he
was
conscious
of
its
tameness
he
felt
that
he
should
say
all
sorts
of
vehement
things
how
he
thought
of
her
every
minute
of
the
day
and
how
he
longed
to
kiss
her
beautiful
hands
and
how
he
trembled
at
the
thought
of
her
red
lips
but
some
inexplicable
modesty
prevented
him
and
instead
he
told
her
of
his
new
rooms
and
his
office
the
answer
came
by
return
of
post
angry
heartbroken
reproachful
how
could
he
be
so
cold
did
he
not
know
that
she
hung
on
his
letters
she
had
given
him
all
that
a
woman
could
give
and
this
was
her
reward
was
he
tired
of
her
already
then
because
he
did
not
reply
for
several
days
miss
wilkinson
bombarded
him
with
letters
she
could
not
bear
his
unkindness
she
waited
for
the
post
and
it
never
brought
her
his
letter
she
cried
herself
to
sleep
night
after
night
she
was
looking
so
ill
that
everyone
remarked
on
it
if
he
did
not
love
her
why
did
he
not
say
so
she
added
that
she
could
not
live
without
him
and
the
only
thing
was
for
her
to
commit
suicide
she
told
him
he
was
cold
and
selfish
and
ungrateful
it
was
all
in
french
and
philip
knew
that
she
wrote
in
that
language
to
show
off
but
he
was
worried
all
the
same
he
did
not
want
to
make
her
unhappy
in
a
little
while
she
wrote
that
she
could
not
bear
the
separation
any
longer
she
would
arrange
to
come
over
to
london
for
christmas
philip
wrote
back
that
he
would
like
nothing
better
only
he
had
already
an
engagement
to
spend
christmas
with
friends
in
the
country
and
he
did
not
see
how
he
could
break
it
she
answered
that
she
did
not
wish
to
force
herself
on
him
it
was
quite
evident
that
he
did
not
wish
to
see
her
she
was
deeply
hurt
and
she
never
thought
he
would
repay
with
such
cruelty
all
her
kindness
her
letter
was
touching
and
philip
thought
he
saw
marks
of
her
tears
on
the
paper
he
wrote
an
impulsive
reply
saying
that
he
was
dreadfully
sorry
and
imploring
her
to
come
but
it
was
with
relief
that
he
received
her
answer
in
which
she
said
that
she
found
it
would
be
impossible
for
her
to
get
away
presently
when
her
letters
came
his
heart
sank
he
delayed
opening
them
for
he
knew
what
they
would
contain
angry
reproaches
and
pathetic
appeals
they
would
make
him
feel
a
perfect
beast
and
yet
he
did
not
see
with
what
he
had
to
blame
himself
he
put
off
his
answer
from
day
to
day
and
then
another
letter
would
come
saying
she
was
ill
and
lonely
and
miserable
i
wish
to
god
id
never
had
anything
to
do
with
her
he
said
he
admired
watson
because
he
arranged
these
things
so
easily
the
young
man
had
been
engaged
in
an
intrigue
with
a
girl
who
played
in
touring
companies
and
his
account
of
the
affair
filled
philip
with
envious
amazement
but
after
a
time
watsons
young
affections
changed
and
one
day
he
described
the
rupture
to
philip
i
thought
it
was
no
good
making
any
bones
about
it
so
i
just
told
her
id
had
enough
of
her
he
said
didnt
she
make
an
awful
scene
asked
philip
the
usual
thing
you
know
but
i
told
her
it
was
no
good
trying
on
that
sort
of
thing
with
me
did
she
cry
she
began
to
but
i
cant
stand
women
when
they
cry
so
i
said
shed
better
hook
it
philips
sense
of
humour
was
growing
keener
with
advancing
years
and
did
she
hook
it
he
asked
smiling
well
there
wasnt
anything
else
for
her
to
do
was
there
meanwhile
the
christmas
holidays
approached
mrs
carey
had
been
ill
all
through
november
and
the
doctor
suggested
that
she
and
the
vicar
should
go
to
cornwall
for
a
couple
of
weeks
round
christmas
so
that
she
should
get
back
her
strength
the
result
was
that
philip
had
nowhere
to
go
and
he
spent
christmas
day
in
his
lodgings
under
haywards
influence
he
had
persuaded
himself
that
the
festivities
that
attend
this
season
were
vulgar
and
barbaric
and
he
made
up
his
mind
that
he
would
take
no
notice
of
the
day
but
when
it
came
the
jollity
of
all
around
affected
him
strangely
his
landlady
and
her
husband
were
spending
the
day
with
a
married
daughter
and
to
save
trouble
philip
announced
that
he
would
take
his
meals
out
he
went
up
to
london
towards
midday
and
ate
a
slice
of
turkey
and
some
christmas
pudding
by
himself
at
gattis
and
since
he
had
nothing
to
do
afterwards
went
to
westminster
abbey
for
the
afternoon
service
the
streets
were
almost
empty
and
the
people
who
went
along
had
a
preoccupied
look
they
did
not
saunter
but
walked
with
some
definite
goal
in
view
and
hardly
anyone
was
alone
to
philip
they
all
seemed
happy
he
felt
himself
more
solitary
than
he
had
ever
done
in
his
life
his
intention
had
been
to
kill
the
day
somehow
in
the
streets
and
then
dine
at
a
restaurant
but
he
could
not
face
again
the
sight
of
cheerful
people
talking
laughing
and
making
merry
so
he
went
back
to
waterloo
and
on
his
way
through
the
westminster
bridge
road
bought
some
ham
and
a
couple
of
mince
pies
and
went
back
to
barnes
he
ate
his
food
in
his
lonely
little
room
and
spent
the
evening
with
a
book
his
depression
was
almost
intolerable
when
he
was
back
at
the
office
it
made
him
very
sore
to
listen
to
watsons
account
of
the
short
holiday
they
had
had
some
jolly
girls
staying
with
them
and
after
dinner
they
had
cleared
out
the
drawingroom
and
had
a
dance
i
didnt
get
to
bed
till
three
and
i
dont
know
how
i
got
there
then
by
george
i
was
squiffy
at
last
philip
asked
desperately
how
does
one
get
to
know
people
in
london
watson
looked
at
him
with
surprise
and
with
a
slightly
contemptuous
amusement
oh
i
dont
know
one
just
knows
them
if
you
go
to
dances
you
soon
get
to
know
as
many
people
as
you
can
do
with
philip
hated
watson
and
yet
he
would
have
given
anything
to
change
places
with
him
the
old
feeling
that
he
had
had
at
school
came
back
to
him
and
he
tried
to
throw
himself
into
the
others
skin
imagining
what
life
would
be
if
he
were
watson
chapter
xxxviii
at
the
end
of
the
year
there
was
a
great
deal
to
do
philip
went
to
various
places
with
a
clerk
named
thompson
and
spent
the
day
monotonously
calling
out
items
of
expenditure
which
the
other
checked
and
sometimes
he
was
given
long
pages
of
figures
to
add
up
he
had
never
had
a
head
for
figures
and
he
could
only
do
this
slowly
thompson
grew
irritated
at
his
mistakes
his
fellowclerk
was
a
long
lean
man
of
forty
sallow
with
black
hair
and
a
ragged
moustache
he
had
hollow
cheeks
and
deep
lines
on
each
side
of
his
nose
he
took
a
dislike
to
philip
because
he
was
an
articled
clerk
because
he
could
put
down
three
hundred
guineas
and
keep
himself
for
five
years
philip
had
the
chance
of
a
career
while
he
with
his
experience
and
ability
had
no
possibility
of
ever
being
more
than
a
clerk
at
thirtyfive
shillings
a
week
he
was
a
crossgrained
man
oppressed
by
a
large
family
and
he
resented
the
superciliousness
which
he
fancied
he
saw
in
philip
he
sneered
at
philip
because
he
was
better
educated
than
himself
and
he
mocked
at
philips
pronunciation
he
could
not
forgive
him
because
he
spoke
without
a
cockney
accent
and
when
he
talked
to
him
sarcastically
exaggerated
his
aitches
at
first
his
manner
was
merely
gruff
and
repellent
but
as
he
discovered
that
philip
had
no
gift
for
accountancy
he
took
pleasure
in
humiliating
him
his
attacks
were
gross
and
silly
but
they
wounded
philip
and
in
selfdefence
he
assumed
an
attitude
of
superiority
which
he
did
not
feel
had
a
bath
this
morning
thompson
said
when
philip
came
to
the
office
late
for
his
early
punctuality
had
not
lasted
yes
havent
you
no
im
not
a
gentleman
im
only
a
clerk
i
have
a
bath
on
saturday
night
i
suppose
thats
why
youre
more
than
usually
disagreeable
on
monday
will
you
condescend
to
do
a
few
sums
in
simple
addition
today
im
afraid
its
asking
a
great
deal
from
a
gentleman
who
knows
latin
and
greek
your
attempts
at
sarcasm
are
not
very
happy
but
philip
could
not
conceal
from
himself
that
the
other
clerks
illpaid
and
uncouth
were
more
useful
than
himself
once
or
twice
mr
goodworthy
grew
impatient
with
him
you
really
ought
to
be
able
to
do
better
than
this
by
now
he
said
youre
not
even
as
smart
as
the
officeboy
philip
listened
sulkily
he
did
not
like
being
blamed
and
it
humiliated
him
when
having
been
given
accounts
to
make
fair
copies
of
mr
goodworthy
was
not
satisfied
and
gave
them
to
another
clerk
to
do
at
first
the
work
had
been
tolerable
from
its
novelty
but
now
it
grew
irksome
and
when
he
discovered
that
he
had
no
aptitude
for
it
he
began
to
hate
it
often
when
he
should
have
been
doing
something
that
was
given
him
he
wasted
his
time
drawing
little
pictures
on
the
office
notepaper
he
made
sketches
of
watson
in
every
conceivable
attitude
and
watson
was
impressed
by
his
talent
it
occurred
to
him
to
take
the
drawings
home
and
he
came
back
next
day
with
the
praises
of
his
family
i
wonder
you
didnt
become
a
painter
he
said
only
of
course
theres
no
money
in
it
it
chanced
that
mr
carter
two
or
three
days
later
was
dining
with
the
watsons
and
the
sketches
were
shown
him
the
following
morning
he
sent
for
philip
philip
saw
him
seldom
and
stood
in
some
awe
of
him
look
here
young
fellow
i
dont
care
what
you
do
out
of
officehours
but
ive
seen
those
sketches
of
yours
and
theyre
on
officepaper
and
mr
goodworthy
tells
me
youre
slack
you
wont
do
any
good
as
a
chartered
accountant
unless
you
look
alive
its
a
fine
profession
and
were
getting
a
very
good
class
of
men
in
it
but
its
a
profession
in
which
you
have
to
he
looked
for
the
termination
of
his
phrase
but
could
not
find
exactly
what
he
wanted
so
finished
rather
tamely
in
which
you
have
to
look
alive
perhaps
philip
would
have
settled
down
but
for
the
agreement
that
if
he
did
not
like
the
work
he
could
leave
after
a
year
and
get
back
half
the
money
paid
for
his
articles
he
felt
that
he
was
fit
for
something
better
than
to
add
up
accounts
and
it
was
humiliating
that
he
did
so
ill
something
which
seemed
contemptible
the
vulgar
scenes
with
thompson
got
on
his
nerves
in
march
watson
ended
his
year
at
the
office
and
philip
though
he
did
not
care
for
him
saw
him
go
with
regret
the
fact
that
the
other
clerks
disliked
them
equally
because
they
belonged
to
a
class
a
little
higher
than
their
own
was
a
bond
of
union
when
philip
thought
that
he
must
spend
over
four
years
more
with
that
dreary
set
of
fellows
his
heart
sank
he
had
expected
wonderful
things
from
london
and
it
had
given
him
nothing
he
hated
it
now
he
did
not
know
a
soul
and
he
had
no
idea
how
he
was
to
get
to
know
anyone
he
was
tired
of
going
everywhere
by
himself
he
began
to
feel
that
he
could
not
stand
much
more
of
such
a
life
he
would
lie
in
bed
at
night
and
think
of
the
joy
of
never
seeing
again
that
dingy
office
or
any
of
the
men
in
it
and
of
getting
away
from
those
drab
lodgings
a
great
disappointment
befell
him
in
the
spring
hayward
had
announced
his
intention
of
coming
to
london
for
the
season
and
philip
had
looked
forward
very
much
to
seeing
him
again
he
had
read
so
much
lately
and
thought
so
much
that
his
mind
was
full
of
ideas
which
he
wanted
to
discuss
and
he
knew
nobody
who
was
willing
to
interest
himself
in
abstract
things
he
was
quite
excited
at
the
thought
of
talking
his
fill
with
someone
and
he
was
wretched
when
hayward
wrote
to
say
that
the
spring
was
lovelier
than
ever
he
had
known
it
in
italy
and
he
could
not
bear
to
tear
himself
away
he
went
on
to
ask
why
philip
did
not
come
what
was
the
use
of
squandering
the
days
of
his
youth
in
an
office
when
the
world
was
beautiful
the
letter
proceeded
i
wonder
you
can
bear
it
i
think
of
fleet
street
and
lincolns
inn
now
with
a
shudder
of
disgust
there
are
only
two
things
in
the
world
that
make
life
worth
living
love
and
art
i
cannot
imagine
you
sitting
in
an
office
over
a
ledger
and
do
you
wear
a
tall
hat
and
an
umbrella
and
a
little
black
bag
my
feeling
is
that
one
should
look
upon
life
as
an
adventure
one
should
burn
with
the
hard
gemlike
flame
and
one
should
take
risks
one
should
expose
oneself
to
danger
why
do
you
not
go
to
paris
and
study
art
i
always
thought
you
had
talent
the
suggestion
fell
in
with
the
possibility
that
philip
for
some
time
had
been
vaguely
turning
over
in
his
mind
it
startled
him
at
first
but
he
could
not
help
thinking
of
it
and
in
the
constant
rumination
over
it
he
found
his
only
escape
from
the
wretchedness
of
his
present
state
they
all
thought
he
had
talent
at
heidelberg
they
had
admired
his
water
colours
miss
wilkinson
had
told
him
over
and
over
again
that
they
were
chasing
even
strangers
like
the
watsons
had
been
struck
by
his
sketches
la
vie
de
boheme
had
made
a
deep
impression
on
him
he
had
brought
it
to
london
and
when
he
was
most
depressed
he
had
only
to
read
a
few
pages
to
be
transported
into
those
chasing
attics
where
rodolphe
and
the
rest
of
them
danced
and
loved
and
sang
he
began
to
think
of
paris
as
before
he
had
thought
of
london
but
he
had
no
fear
of
a
second
disillusion
he
yearned
for
romance
and
beauty
and
love
and
paris
seemed
to
offer
them
all
he
had
a
passion
for
pictures
and
why
should
he
not
be
able
to
paint
as
well
as
anybody
else
he
wrote
to
miss
wilkinson
and
asked
her
how
much
she
thought
he
could
live
on
in
paris
she
told
him
that
he
could
manage
easily
on
eighty
pounds
a
year
and
she
enthusiastically
approved
of
his
project
she
told
him
he
was
too
good
to
be
wasted
in
an
office
who
would
be
a
clerk
when
he
might
be
a
great
artist
she
asked
dramatically
and
she
besought
philip
to
believe
in
himself
that
was
the
great
thing
but
philip
had
a
cautious
nature
it
was
all
very
well
for
hayward
to
talk
of
taking
risks
he
had
three
hundred
a
year
in
giltedged
securities
philips
entire
fortune
amounted
to
no
more
than
eighteenhundred
pounds
he
hesitated
then
it
chanced
that
one
day
mr
goodworthy
asked
him
suddenly
if
he
would
like
to
go
to
paris
the
firm
did
the
accounts
for
a
hotel
in
the
faubourg
st
honore
which
was
owned
by
an
english
company
and
twice
a
year
mr
goodworthy
and
a
clerk
went
over
the
clerk
who
generally
went
happened
to
be
ill
and
a
press
of
work
prevented
any
of
the
others
from
getting
away
mr
goodworthy
thought
of
philip
because
he
could
best
be
spared
and
his
articles
gave
him
some
claim
upon
a
job
which
was
one
of
the
pleasures
of
the
business
philip
was
delighted
youll
ave
to
work
all
day
said
mr
goodworthy
but
we
get
our
evenings
to
ourselves
and
paris
is
paris
he
smiled
in
a
knowing
way
they
do
us
very
well
at
the
hotel
and
they
give
us
all
our
meals
so
it
dont
cost
one
anything
thats
the
way
i
like
going
to
paris
at
other
peoples
expense
when
they
arrived
at
calais
and
philip
saw
the
crowd
of
gesticulating
porters
his
heart
leaped
this
is
the
real
thing
he
said
to
himself
he
was
all
eyes
as
the
train
sped
through
the
country
he
adored
the
sand
dunes
their
colour
seemed
to
him
more
lovely
than
anything
he
had
ever
seen
and
he
was
enchanted
with
the
canals
and
the
long
lines
of
poplars
when
they
got
out
of
the
gare
du
nord
and
trundled
along
the
cobbled
streets
in
a
ramshackle
noisy
cab
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
breathing
a
new
air
so
intoxicating
that
he
could
hardly
restrain
himself
from
shouting
aloud
they
were
met
at
the
door
of
the
hotel
by
the
manager
a
stout
pleasant
man
who
spoke
tolerable
english
mr
goodworthy
was
an
old
friend
and
he
greeted
them
effusively
they
dined
in
his
private
room
with
his
wife
and
to
philip
it
seemed
that
he
had
never
eaten
anything
so
delicious
as
the
beefsteak
aux
pommes
nor
drunk
such
nectar
as
the
vin
ordinaire
which
were
set
before
them
to
mr
goodworthy
a
respectable
householder
with
excellent
principles
the
capital
of
france
was
a
paradise
of
the
joyously
obscene
he
asked
the
manager
next
morning
what
there
was
to
be
seen
that
was
thick
he
thoroughly
enjoyed
these
visits
of
his
to
paris
he
said
they
kept
you
from
growing
rusty
in
the
evenings
after
their
work
was
over
and
they
had
dined
he
took
philip
to
the
moulin
rouge
and
the
folies
bergeres
his
little
eyes
twinkled
and
his
face
wore
a
sly
sensual
smile
as
he
sought
out
the
pornographic
he
went
into
all
the
haunts
which
were
specially
arranged
for
the
foreigner
and
afterwards
said
that
a
nation
could
come
to
no
good
which
permitted
that
sort
of
thing
he
nudged
philip
when
at
some
revue
a
woman
appeared
with
practically
nothing
on
and
pointed
out
to
him
the
most
strapping
of
the
courtesans
who
walked
about
the
hall
it
was
a
vulgar
paris
that
he
showed
philip
but
philip
saw
it
with
eyes
blinded
with
illusion
in
the
early
morning
he
would
rush
out
of
the
hotel
and
go
to
the
champs
elysees
and
stand
at
the
place
de
la
concorde
it
was
june
and
paris
was
silvery
with
the
delicacy
of
the
air
philip
felt
his
heart
go
out
to
the
people
here
he
thought
at
last
was
romance
they
spent
the
inside
of
a
week
there
leaving
on
sunday
and
when
philip
late
at
night
reached
his
dingy
rooms
in
barnes
his
mind
was
made
up
he
would
surrender
his
articles
and
go
to
paris
to
study
art
but
so
that
no
one
should
think
him
unreasonable
he
determined
to
stay
at
the
office
till
his
year
was
up
he
was
to
have
his
holiday
during
the
last
fortnight
in
august
and
when
he
went
away
he
would
tell
herbert
carter
that
he
had
no
intention
of
returning
but
though
philip
could
force
himself
to
go
to
the
office
every
day
he
could
not
even
pretend
to
show
any
interest
in
the
work
his
mind
was
occupied
with
the
future
after
the
middle
of
july
there
was
nothing
much
to
do
and
he
escaped
a
good
deal
by
pretending
he
had
to
go
to
lectures
for
his
first
examination
the
time
he
got
in
this
way
he
spent
in
the
national
gallery
he
read
books
about
paris
and
books
about
painting
he
was
steeped
in
ruskin
he
read
many
of
vasaris
lives
of
the
painters
he
liked
that
story
of
correggio
and
he
fancied
himself
standing
before
some
great
masterpiece
and
crying
anch
io
son
pittore
his
hesitation
had
left
him
now
and
he
was
convinced
that
he
had
in
him
the
makings
of
a
great
painter
after
all
i
can
only
try
he
said
to
himself
the
great
thing
in
life
is
to
take
risks
at
last
came
the
middle
of
august
mr
carter
was
spending
the
month
in
scotland
and
the
managing
clerk
was
in
charge
of
the
office
mr
goodworthy
had
seemed
pleasantly
disposed
to
philip
since
their
trip
to
paris
and
now
that
philip
knew
he
was
so
soon
to
be
free
he
could
look
upon
the
funny
little
man
with
tolerance
youre
going
for
your
holiday
tomorrow
carey
he
said
to
him
in
the
evening
all
day
philip
had
been
telling
himself
that
this
was
the
last
time
he
would
ever
sit
in
that
hateful
office
yes
this
is
the
end
of
my
year
im
afraid
youve
not
done
very
well
mr
carters
very
dissatisfied
with
you
not
nearly
so
dissatisfied
as
i
am
with
mr
carter
returned
philip
cheerfully
i
dont
think
you
should
speak
like
that
carey
im
not
coming
back
i
made
the
arrangement
that
if
i
didnt
like
accountancy
mr
carter
would
return
me
half
the
money
i
paid
for
my
articles
and
i
could
chuck
it
at
the
end
of
a
year
you
shouldnt
come
to
such
a
decision
hastily
for
ten
months
ive
loathed
it
all
ive
loathed
the
work
ive
loathed
the
office
i
loathe
loudon
id
rather
sweep
a
crossing
than
spend
my
days
here
well
i
must
say
i
dont
think
youre
very
fitted
for
accountancy
goodbye
said
philip
holding
out
his
hand
i
want
to
thank
you
for
your
kindness
to
me
im
sorry
if
ive
been
troublesome
i
knew
almost
from
the
beginning
i
was
no
good
well
if
you
really
do
make
up
your
mind
it
is
goodbye
i
dont
know
what
youre
going
to
do
but
if
youre
in
the
neighbourhood
at
any
time
come
in
and
see
us
philip
gave
a
little
laugh
im
afraid
it
sounds
very
rude
but
i
hope
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
that
i
shall
never
set
eyes
on
any
of
you
again
chapter
xxxix
the
vicar
of
blackstable
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
scheme
which
philip
laid
before
him
he
had
a
great
idea
that
one
should
stick
to
whatever
one
had
begun
like
all
weak
men
he
laid
an
exaggerated
stress
on
not
changing
ones
mind
you
chose
to
be
an
accountant
of
your
own
free
will
he
said
i
just
took
that
because
it
was
the
only
chance
i
saw
of
getting
up
to
town
i
hate
london
i
hate
the
work
and
nothing
will
induce
me
to
go
back
to
it
mr
and
mrs
carey
were
frankly
shocked
at
philips
idea
of
being
an
artist
he
should
not
forget
they
said
that
his
father
and
mother
were
gentlefolk
and
painting
wasnt
a
serious
profession
it
was
bohemian
disreputable
immoral
and
then
paris
so
long
as
i
have
anything
to
say
in
the
matter
i
shall
not
allow
you
to
live
in
paris
said
the
vicar
firmly
it
was
a
sink
of
iniquity
the
scarlet
woman
and
she
of
babylon
haunted
their
vileness
there
the
cities
of
the
plain
were
not
more
wicked
youve
been
brought
up
like
a
gentleman
and
christian
and
i
should
be
false
to
the
trust
laid
upon
me
by
your
dead
father
and
mother
if
i
allowed
you
to
expose
yourself
to
such
temptation
well
i
know
im
not
a
christian
and
im
beginning
to
doubt
whether
im
a
gentleman
said
philip
the
dispute
grew
more
violent
there
was
another
year
before
philip
took
possession
of
his
small
inheritance
and
during
that
time
mr
carey
proposed
only
to
give
him
an
allowance
if
he
remained
at
the
office
it
was
clear
to
philip
that
if
he
meant
not
to
continue
with
accountancy
he
must
leave
it
while
he
could
still
get
back
half
the
money
that
had
been
paid
for
his
articles
the
vicar
would
not
listen
philip
losing
all
reserve
said
things
to
wound
and
irritate
youve
got
no
right
to
waste
my
money
he
said
at
last
after
all
its
my
money
isnt
it
im
not
a
child
you
cant
prevent
me
from
going
to
paris
if
i
make
up
my
mind
to
you
cant
force
me
to
go
back
to
london
all
i
can
do
is
to
refuse
you
money
unless
you
do
what
i
think
fit
well
i
dont
care
ive
made
up
my
mind
to
go
to
paris
i
shall
sell
my
clothes
and
my
books
and
my
fathers
jewellery
aunt
louisa
sat
by
in
silence
anxious
and
unhappy
she
saw
that
philip
was
beside
himself
and
anything
she
said
then
would
but
increase
his
anger
finally
the
vicar
announced
that
he
wished
to
hear
nothing
more
about
it
and
with
dignity
left
the
room
for
the
next
three
days
neither
philip
nor
he
spoke
to
one
another
philip
wrote
to
hayward
for
information
about
paris
and
made
up
his
mind
to
set
out
as
soon
as
he
got
a
reply
mrs
carey
turned
the
matter
over
in
her
mind
incessantly
she
felt
that
philip
included
her
in
the
hatred
he
bore
her
husband
and
the
thought
tortured
her
she
loved
him
with
all
her
heart
at
length
she
spoke
to
him
she
listened
attentively
while
he
poured
out
all
his
disillusionment
of
london
and
his
eager
ambition
for
the
future
i
may
be
no
good
but
at
least
let
me
have
a
try
i
cant
be
a
worse
failure
than
i
was
in
that
beastly
office
and
i
feel
that
i
can
paint
i
know
ive
got
it
in
me
she
was
not
so
sure
as
her
husband
that
they
did
right
in
thwarting
so
strong
an
inclination
she
had
read
of
great
painters
whose
parents
had
opposed
their
wish
to
study
the
event
had
shown
with
what
folly
and
after
all
it
was
just
as
possible
for
a
painter
to
lead
a
virtuous
life
to
the
glory
of
god
as
for
a
chartered
accountant
im
so
afraid
of
your
going
to
paris
she
said
piteously
it
wouldnt
be
so
bad
if
you
studied
in
london
if
im
going
in
for
painting
i
must
do
it
thoroughly
and
its
only
in
paris
that
you
can
get
the
real
thing
at
his
suggestion
mrs
carey
wrote
to
the
solicitor
saying
that
philip
was
discontented
with
his
work
in
london
and
asking
what
he
thought
of
a
change
mr
nixon
answered
as
follows
dear
mrs
carey
i
have
seen
mr
herbert
carter
and
i
am
afraid
i
must
tell
you
that
philip
has
not
done
so
well
as
one
could
have
wished
if
he
is
very
strongly
set
against
the
work
perhaps
it
is
better
that
he
should
take
the
opportunity
there
is
now
to
break
his
articles
i
am
naturally
very
disappointed
but
as
you
know
you
can
take
a
horse
to
the
water
but
you
cant
make
him
drink
yours
very
sincerely
albert
nixon
the
letter
was
shown
to
the
vicar
but
served
only
to
increase
his
obstinacy
he
was
willing
enough
that
philip
should
take
up
some
other
profession
he
suggested
his
fathers
calling
medicine
but
nothing
would
induce
him
to
pay
an
allowance
if
philip
went
to
paris
its
a
mere
excuse
for
selfindulgence
and
sensuality
he
said
im
interested
to
hear
you
blame
selfindulgence
in
others
retorted
philip
acidly
but
by
this
time
an
answer
had
come
from
hayward
giving
the
name
of
a
hotel
where
philip
could
get
a
room
for
thirty
francs
a
month
and
enclosing
a
note
of
introduction
to
the
massiere
of
a
school
philip
read
the
letter
to
mrs
carey
and
told
her
he
proposed
to
start
on
the
first
of
september
but
you
havent
got
any
money
she
said
im
going
into
tercanbury
this
afternoon
to
sell
the
jewellery
he
had
inherited
from
his
father
a
gold
watch
and
chain
two
or
three
rings
some
links
and
two
pins
one
of
them
was
a
pearl
and
might
fetch
a
considerable
sum
its
a
very
different
thing
what
a
things
worth
and
what
itll
fetch
said
aunt
louisa
philip
smiled
for
this
was
one
of
his
uncles
stock
phrases
i
know
but
at
the
worst
i
think
i
can
get
a
hundred
pounds
on
the
lot
and
thatll
keep
me
till
im
twentyone
mrs
carey
did
not
answer
but
she
went
upstairs
put
on
her
little
black
bonnet
and
went
to
the
bank
in
an
hour
she
came
back
she
went
to
philip
who
was
reading
in
the
drawingroom
and
handed
him
an
envelope
whats
this
he
asked
its
a
little
present
for
you
she
answered
smiling
shyly
he
opened
it
and
found
eleven
fivepound
notes
and
a
little
paper
sack
bulging
with
sovereigns
i
couldnt
bear
to
let
you
sell
your
fathers
jewellery
its
the
money
i
had
in
the
bank
it
comes
to
very
nearly
a
hundred
pounds
philip
blushed
and
he
knew
not
why
tears
suddenly
filled
his
eyes
oh
my
dear
i
cant
take
it
he
said
its
most
awfully
good
of
you
but
i
couldnt
bear
to
take
it
when
mrs
carey
was
married
she
had
three
hundred
pounds
and
this
money
carefully
watched
had
been
used
by
her
to
meet
any
unforeseen
expense
any
urgent
charity
or
to
buy
christmas
and
birthday
presents
for
her
husband
and
for
philip
in
the
course
of
years
it
had
diminished
sadly
but
it
was
still
with
the
vicar
a
subject
for
jesting
he
talked
of
his
wife
as
a
rich
woman
and
he
constantly
spoke
of
the
nest
egg
oh
please
take
it
philip
im
so
sorry
ive
been
extravagant
and
theres
only
that
left
but
itll
make
me
so
happy
if
youll
accept
it
but
youll
want
it
said
philip
no
i
dont
think
i
shall
i
was
keeping
it
in
case
your
uncle
died
before
me
i
thought
it
would
be
useful
to
have
a
little
something
i
could
get
at
immediately
if
i
wanted
it
but
i
dont
think
i
shall
live
very
much
longer
now
oh
my
dear
dont
say
that
why
of
course
youre
going
to
live
for
ever
i
cant
possibly
spare
you
oh
im
not
sorry
her
voice
broke
and
she
hid
her
eyes
but
in
a
moment
drying
them
she
smiled
bravely
at
first
i
used
to
pray
to
god
that
he
might
not
take
me
first
because
i
didnt
want
your
uncle
to
be
left
alone
i
didnt
want
him
to
have
all
the
suffering
but
now
i
know
that
it
wouldnt
mean
so
much
to
your
uncle
as
it
would
mean
to
me
he
wants
to
live
more
than
i
do
ive
never
been
the
wife
he
wanted
and
i
daresay
hed
marry
again
if
anything
happened
to
me
so
i
should
like
to
go
first
you
dont
think
its
selfish
of
me
philip
do
you
but
i
couldnt
bear
it
if
he
went
philip
kissed
her
wrinkled
thin
cheek
he
did
not
know
why
the
sight
he
had
of
that
overwhelming
love
made
him
feel
strangely
ashamed
it
was
incomprehensible
that
she
should
care
so
much
for
a
man
who
was
so
indifferent
so
selfish
so
grossly
selfindulgent
and
he
divined
dimly
that
in
her
heart
she
knew
his
indifference
and
his
selfishness
knew
them
and
loved
him
humbly
all
the
same
you
will
take
the
money
philip
she
said
gently
stroking
his
hand
i
know
you
can
do
without
it
but
itll
give
me
so
much
happiness
ive
always
wanted
to
do
something
for
you
you
see
i
never
had
a
child
of
my
own
and
ive
loved
you
as
if
you
were
my
son
when
you
were
a
little
boy
though
i
knew
it
was
wicked
i
used
to
wish
almost
that
you
might
be
ill
so
that
i
could
nurse
you
day
and
night
but
you
were
only
ill
once
and
then
it
was
at
school
i
should
so
like
to
help
you
its
the
only
chance
i
shall
ever
have
and
perhaps
some
day
when
youre
a
great
artist
you
wont
forget
me
but
youll
remember
that
i
gave
you
your
start
its
very
good
of
you
said
philip
im
very
grateful
a
smile
came
into
her
tired
eyes
a
smile
of
pure
happiness
oh
im
so
glad
chapter
xl
a
few
days
later
mrs
carey
went
to
the
station
to
see
philip
off
she
stood
at
the
door
of
the
carriage
trying
to
keep
back
her
tears
philip
was
restless
and
eager
he
wanted
to
be
gone
kiss
me
once
more
she
said
he
leaned
out
of
the
window
and
kissed
her
the
train
started
and
she
stood
on
the
wooden
platform
of
the
little
station
waving
her
handkerchief
till
it
was
out
of
sight
her
heart
was
dreadfully
heavy
and
the
few
hundred
yards
to
the
vicarage
seemed
very
very
long
it
was
natural
enough
that
he
should
be
eager
to
go
she
thought
he
was
a
boy
and
the
future
beckoned
to
him
but
sheshe
clenched
her
teeth
so
that
she
should
not
cry
she
uttered
a
little
inward
prayer
that
god
would
guard
him
and
keep
him
out
of
temptation
and
give
him
happiness
and
good
fortune
but
philip
ceased
to
think
of
her
a
moment
after
he
had
settled
down
in
his
carriage
he
thought
only
of
the
future
he
had
written
to
mrs
otter
the
massiere
to
whom
hayward
had
given
him
an
introduction
and
had
in
his
pocket
an
invitation
to
tea
on
the
following
day
when
he
arrived
in
paris
he
had
his
luggage
put
on
a
cab
and
trundled
off
slowly
through
the
gay
streets
over
the
bridge
and
along
the
narrow
ways
of
the
latin
quarter
he
had
taken
a
room
at
the
hotel
des
deux
ecoles
which
was
in
a
shabby
street
off
the
boulevard
du
montparuasse
it
was
convenient
for
amitranos
school
at
which
he
was
going
to
work
a
waiter
took
his
box
up
five
flights
of
stairs
and
philip
was
shown
into
a
tiny
room
fusty
from
unopened
windows
the
greater
part
of
which
was
taken
up
by
a
large
wooden
bed
with
a
canopy
over
it
of
red
rep
there
were
heavy
curtains
on
the
windows
of
the
same
dingy
material
the
chest
of
drawers
served
also
as
a
washingstand
and
there
was
a
massive
wardrobe
of
the
style
which
is
connected
with
the
good
king
louis
philippe
the
wallpaper
was
discoloured
with
age
it
was
dark
gray
and
there
could
be
vaguely
seen
on
it
garlands
of
brown
leaves
to
philip
the
room
seemed
quaint
and
charming
though
it
was
late
he
felt
too
excited
to
sleep
and
going
out
made
his
way
into
the
boulevard
and
walked
towards
the
light
this
led
him
to
the
station
and
the
square
in
front
of
it
vivid
with
arclamps
noisy
with
the
yellow
trams
that
seemed
to
cross
it
in
all
directions
made
him
laugh
aloud
with
joy
there
were
cafes
all
round
and
by
chance
thirsty
and
eager
to
get
a
nearer
sight
of
the
crowd
philip
installed
himself
at
a
little
table
outside
the
cafe
de
versailles
every
other
table
was
taken
for
it
was
a
fine
night
and
philip
looked
curiously
at
the
people
here
little
family
groups
there
a
knot
of
men
with
oddshaped
hats
and
beards
talking
loudly
and
gesticulating
next
to
him
were
two
men
who
looked
like
painters
with
women
who
philip
hoped
were
not
their
lawful
wives
behind
him
he
heard
americans
loudly
arguing
on
art
his
soul
was
thrilled
he
sat
till
very
late
tired
out
but
too
happy
to
move
and
when
at
last
he
went
to
bed
he
was
wide
awake
he
listened
to
the
manifold
noise
of
paris
next
day
about
teatime
he
made
his
way
to
the
lion
de
belfort
and
in
a
new
street
that
led
out
of
the
boulevard
raspail
found
mrs
otter
she
was
an
insignificant
woman
of
thirty
with
a
provincial
air
and
a
deliberately
ladylike
manner
she
introduced
him
to
her
mother
he
discovered
presently
that
she
had
been
studying
in
paris
for
three
years
and
later
that
she
was
separated
from
her
husband
she
had
in
her
small
drawingroom
one
or
two
portraits
which
she
had
painted
and
to
philips
inexperience
they
seemed
extremely
accomplished
i
wonder
if
i
shall
ever
be
able
to
paint
as
well
as
that
he
said
to
her
oh
i
expect
so
she
replied
not
without
selfsatisfaction
you
cant
expect
to
do
everything
all
at
once
of
course
she
was
very
kind
she
gave
him
the
address
of
a
shop
where
he
could
get
a
portfolio
drawingpaper
and
charcoal
i
shall
be
going
to
amitranos
about
nine
tomorrow
and
if
youll
be
there
then
ill
see
that
you
get
a
good
place
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
she
asked
him
what
he
wanted
to
do
and
philip
felt
that
he
should
not
let
her
see
how
vague
he
was
about
the
whole
matter
well
first
i
want
to
learn
to
draw
he
said
im
so
glad
to
hear
you
say
that
people
always
want
to
do
things
in
such
a
hurry
i
never
touched
oils
till
id
been
here
for
two
years
and
look
at
the
result
she
gave
a
glance
at
the
portrait
of
her
mother
a
sticky
piece
of
painting
that
hung
over
the
piano
and
if
i
were
you
i
would
be
very
careful
about
the
people
you
get
to
know
i
wouldnt
mix
myself
up
with
any
foreigners
im
very
careful
myself
philip
thanked
her
for
the
suggestion
but
it
seemed
to
him
odd
he
did
not
know
that
he
particularly
wanted
to
be
careful
we
live
just
as
we
would
if
we
were
in
england
said
mrs
otters
mother
who
till
then
had
spoken
little
when
we
came
here
we
brought
all
our
own
furniture
over
philip
looked
round
the
room
it
was
filled
with
a
massive
suite
and
at
the
window
were
the
same
sort
of
white
lace
curtains
which
aunt
louisa
put
up
at
the
vicarage
in
summer
the
piano
was
draped
in
liberty
silk
and
so
was
the
chimneypiece
mrs
otter
followed
his
wandering
eye
in
the
evening
when
we
close
the
shutters
one
might
really
feel
one
was
in
england
and
we
have
our
meals
just
as
if
we
were
at
home
added
her
mother
a
meat
breakfast
in
the
morning
and
dinner
in
the
middle
of
the
day
when
he
left
mrs
otter
philip
went
to
buy
drawing
materials
and
next
morning
at
the
stroke
of
nine
trying
to
seem
selfassured
he
presented
himself
at
the
school
mrs
otter
was
already
there
and
she
came
forward
with
a
friendly
smile
he
had
been
anxious
about
the
reception
he
would
have
as
a
nouveau
for
he
had
read
a
good
deal
of
the
rough
joking
to
which
a
newcomer
was
exposed
at
some
of
the
studios
but
mrs
otter
had
reassured
him
oh
theres
nothing
like
that
here
she
said
you
see
about
half
our
students
are
ladies
and
they
set
a
tone
to
the
place
the
studio
was
large
and
bare
with
gray
walls
on
which
were
pinned
the
studies
that
had
received
prizes
a
model
was
sitting
in
a
chair
with
a
loose
wrap
thrown
over
her
and
about
a
dozen
men
and
women
were
standing
about
some
talking
and
others
still
working
on
their
sketch
it
was
the
first
rest
of
the
model
youd
better
not
try
anything
too
difficult
at
first
said
mrs
otter
put
your
easel
here
youll
find
thats
the
easiest
pose
philip
placed
an
easel
where
she
indicated
and
mrs
otter
introduced
him
to
a
young
woman
who
sat
next
to
him
mr
careymiss
price
mr
careys
never
studied
before
you
wont
mind
helping
him
a
little
just
at
first
will
you
then
she
turned
to
the
model
la
pose
the
model
threw
aside
the
paper
she
had
been
reading
la
petite
republique
and
sulkily
throwing
off
her
gown
got
on
to
the
stand
she
stood
squarely
on
both
feet
with
her
hands
clasped
behind
her
head
its
a
stupid
pose
said
miss
price
i
cant
imagine
why
they
chose
it
when
philip
entered
the
people
in
the
studio
had
looked
at
him
curiously
and
the
model
gave
him
an
indifferent
glance
but
now
they
ceased
to
pay
attention
to
him
philip
with
his
beautiful
sheet
of
paper
in
front
of
him
stared
awkwardly
at
the
model
he
did
not
know
how
to
begin
he
had
never
seen
a
naked
woman
before
she
was
not
young
and
her
breasts
were
shrivelled
she
had
colourless
fair
hair
that
fell
over
her
forehead
untidily
and
her
face
was
covered
with
large
freckles
he
glanced
at
miss
prices
work
she
had
only
been
working
on
it
two
days
and
it
looked
as
though
she
had
had
trouble
her
paper
was
in
a
mess
from
constant
rubbing
out
and
to
philips
eyes
the
figure
looked
strangely
distorted
i
should
have
thought
i
could
do
as
well
as
that
he
said
to
himself
he
began
on
the
head
thinking
that
he
would
work
slowly
downwards
but
he
could
not
understand
why
he
found
it
infinitely
more
difficult
to
draw
a
head
from
the
model
than
to
draw
one
from
his
imagination
he
got
into
difficulties
he
glanced
at
miss
price
she
was
working
with
vehement
gravity
her
brow
was
wrinkled
with
eagerness
and
there
was
an
anxious
look
in
her
eyes
it
was
hot
in
the
studio
and
drops
of
sweat
stood
on
her
forehead
she
was
a
girl
of
twentysix
with
a
great
deal
of
dull
gold
hair
it
was
handsome
hair
but
it
was
carelessly
done
dragged
back
from
her
forehead
and
tied
in
a
hurried
knot
she
had
a
large
face
with
broad
flat
features
and
small
eyes
her
skin
was
pasty
with
a
singular
unhealthiness
of
tone
and
there
was
no
colour
in
the
cheeks
she
had
an
unwashed
air
and
you
could
not
help
wondering
if
she
slept
in
her
clothes
she
was
serious
and
silent
when
the
next
pause
came
she
stepped
back
to
look
at
her
work
i
dont
know
why
im
having
so
much
bother
she
said
but
i
mean
to
get
it
right
she
turned
to
philip
how
are
you
getting
on
not
at
all
he
answered
with
a
rueful
smile
she
looked
at
what
he
had
done
you
cant
expect
to
do
anything
that
way
you
must
take
measurements
and
you
must
square
out
your
paper
she
showed
him
rapidly
how
to
set
about
the
business
philip
was
impressed
by
her
earnestness
but
repelled
by
her
want
of
charm
he
was
grateful
for
the
hints
she
gave
him
and
set
to
work
again
meanwhile
other
people
had
come
in
mostly
men
for
the
women
always
arrived
first
and
the
studio
for
the
time
of
year
it
was
early
yet
was
fairly
full
presently
there
came
in
a
young
man
with
thin
black
hair
an
enormous
nose
and
a
face
so
long
that
it
reminded
you
of
a
horse
he
sat
down
next
to
philip
and
nodded
across
him
to
miss
price
youre
very
late
she
said
are
you
only
just
up
it
was
such
a
splendid
day
i
thought
id
lie
in
bed
and
think
how
beautiful
it
was
out
philip
smiled
but
miss
price
took
the
remark
seriously
that
seems
a
funny
thing
to
do
i
should
have
thought
it
would
be
more
to
the
point
to
get
up
and
enjoy
it
the
way
of
the
humorist
is
very
hard
said
the
young
man
gravely
he
did
not
seem
inclined
to
work
he
looked
at
his
canvas
he
was
working
in
colour
and
had
sketched
in
the
day
before
the
model
who
was
posing
he
turned
to
philip
have
you
just
come
out
from
england
yes
how
did
you
find
your
way
to
amitranos
it
was
the
only
school
i
knew
of
i
hope
you
havent
come
with
the
idea
that
you
will
learn
anything
here
which
will
be
of
the
smallest
use
to
you
its
the
best
school
in
paris
said
miss
price
its
the
only
one
where
they
take
art
seriously
should
art
be
taken
seriously
the
young
man
asked
and
since
miss
price
replied
only
with
a
scornful
shrug
he
added
but
the
point
is
all
schools
are
bad
they
are
academical
obviously
why
this
is
less
injurious
than
most
is
that
the
teaching
is
more
incompetent
than
elsewhere
because
you
learn
nothing
but
why
dyou
come
here
then
interrupted
philip
i
see
the
better
course
but
do
not
follow
it
miss
price
who
is
cultured
will
remember
the
latin
of
that
i
wish
you
would
leave
me
out
of
your
conversation
mr
clutton
said
miss
price
brusquely
the
only
way
to
learn
to
paint
he
went
on
imperturbable
is
to
take
a
studio
hire
a
model
and
just
fight
it
out
for
yourself
that
seems
a
simple
thing
to
do
said
philip
it
only
needs
money
replied
clutton
he
began
to
paint
and
philip
looked
at
him
from
the
comer
of
his
eye
he
was
long
and
desperately
thin
his
huge
bones
seemed
to
protrude
from
his
body
his
elbows
were
so
sharp
that
they
appeared
to
jut
out
through
the
arms
of
his
shabby
coat
his
trousers
were
frayed
at
the
bottom
and
on
each
of
his
boots
was
a
clumsy
patch
miss
price
got
up
and
went
over
to
philips
easel
if
mr
clutton
will
hold
his
tongue
for
a
moment
ill
just
help
you
a
little
she
said
miss
price
dislikes
me
because
i
have
humour
said
clutton
looking
meditatively
at
his
canvas
but
she
detests
me
because
i
have
genius
he
spoke
with
solemnity
and
his
colossal
misshapen
nose
made
what
he
said
very
quaint
philip
was
obliged
to
laugh
but
miss
price
grew
darkly
red
with
anger
youre
the
only
person
who
has
ever
accused
you
of
genius
also
i
am
the
only
person
whose
opinion
is
of
the
least
value
to
me
miss
price
began
to
criticise
what
philip
had
done
she
talked
glibly
of
anatomy
and
construction
planes
and
lines
and
of
much
else
which
philip
did
not
understand
she
had
been
at
the
studio
a
long
time
and
knew
the
main
points
which
the
masters
insisted
upon
but
though
she
could
show
what
was
wrong
with
philips
work
she
could
not
tell
him
how
to
put
it
right
its
awfully
kind
of
you
to
take
so
much
trouble
with
me
said
philip
oh
its
nothing
she
answered
flushing
awkwardly
people
did
the
same
for
me
when
i
first
came
id
do
it
for
anyone
miss
price
wants
to
indicate
that
she
is
giving
you
the
advantage
of
her
knowledge
from
a
sense
of
duty
rather
than
on
account
of
any
charms
of
your
person
said
clutton
miss
price
gave
him
a
furious
look
and
went
back
to
her
own
drawing
the
clock
struck
twelve
and
the
model
with
a
cry
of
relief
stepped
down
from
the
stand
miss
price
gathered
up
her
things
some
of
us
go
to
graviers
for
lunch
she
said
to
philip
with
a
look
at
clutton
i
always
go
home
myself
ill
take
you
to
graviers
it
you
like
said
clutton
philip
thanked
him
and
made
ready
to
go
on
his
way
out
mrs
otter
asked
him
how
he
had
been
getting
on
did
fanny
price
help
you
she
asked
i
put
you
there
because
i
know
she
can
do
it
if
she
likes
shes
a
disagreeable
illnatured
girl
and
she
cant
draw
herself
at
all
but
she
knows
the
ropes
and
she
can
be
useful
to
a
newcomer
if
she
cares
to
take
the
trouble
on
the
way
down
the
street
clutton
said
to
him
youve
made
an
impression
on
fanny
price
youd
better
look
out
philip
laughed
he
had
never
seen
anyone
on
whom
he
wished
less
to
make
an
impression
they
came
to
the
cheap
little
restaurant
at
which
several
of
the
students
ate
and
clutton
sat
down
at
a
table
at
which
three
or
four
men
were
already
seated
for
a
franc
they
got
an
egg
a
plate
of
meat
cheese
and
a
small
bottle
of
wine
coffee
was
extra
they
sat
on
the
pavement
and
yellow
trams
passed
up
and
down
the
boulevard
with
a
ceaseless
ringing
of
bells
by
the
way
whats
your
name
said
clutton
as
they
took
their
seats
carey
allow
me
to
introduce
an
old
and
trusted
friend
carey
by
name
said
clutton
gravely
mr
flanagan
mr
lawson
they
laughed
and
went
on
with
their
conversation
they
talked
of
a
thousand
things
and
they
all
talked
at
once
no
one
paid
the
smallest
attention
to
anyone
else
they
talked
of
the
places
they
had
been
to
in
the
summer
of
studios
of
the
various
schools
they
mentioned
names
which
were
unfamiliar
to
philip
monet
manet
renoir
pissarro
degas
philip
listened
with
all
his
ears
and
though
he
felt
a
little
out
of
it
his
heart
leaped
with
exultation
the
time
flew
when
clutton
got
up
he
said
i
expect
youll
find
me
here
this
evening
if
you
care
to
come
youll
find
this
about
the
best
place
for
getting
dyspepsia
at
the
lowest
cost
in
the
quarter
chapter
xli
philip
walked
down
the
boulevard
du
montparnasse
it
was
not
at
all
like
the
paris
he
had
seen
in
the
spring
during
his
visit
to
do
the
accounts
of
the
hotel
st
georgeshe
thought
already
of
that
part
of
his
life
with
a
shudderbut
reminded
him
of
what
he
thought
a
provincial
town
must
be
there
was
an
easygoing
air
about
it
and
a
sunny
spaciousness
which
invited
the
mind
to
daydreaming
the
trimness
of
the
trees
the
vivid
whiteness
of
the
houses
the
breadth
were
very
agreeable
and
he
felt
himself
already
thoroughly
at
home
he
sauntered
along
staring
at
the
people
there
seemed
an
elegance
about
the
most
ordinary
workmen
with
their
broad
red
sashes
and
their
wide
trousers
little
soldiers
in
dingy
charming
uniforms
he
came
presently
to
the
avenue
de
lobservatoire
and
he
gave
a
sigh
of
pleasure
at
the
magnificent
yet
so
graceful
vista
he
came
to
the
gardens
of
the
luxembourg
children
were
playing
nurses
with
long
ribbons
walked
slowly
two
by
two
busy
men
passed
through
with
satchels
under
their
arms
youths
strangely
dressed
the
scene
was
formal
and
dainty
nature
was
arranged
and
ordered
but
so
exquisitely
that
nature
unordered
and
unarranged
seemed
barbaric
philip
was
enchanted
it
excited
him
to
stand
on
that
spot
of
which
he
had
read
so
much
it
was
classic
ground
to
him
and
he
felt
the
awe
and
the
delight
which
some
old
don
might
feel
when
for
the
first
time
he
looked
on
the
smiling
plain
of
sparta
as
he
wandered
he
chanced
to
see
miss
price
sitting
by
herself
on
a
bench
he
hesitated
for
he
did
not
at
that
moment
want
to
see
anyone
and
her
uncouth
way
seemed
out
of
place
amid
the
happiness
he
felt
around
him
but
he
had
divined
her
sensitiveness
to
affront
and
since
she
had
seen
him
thought
it
would
be
polite
to
speak
to
her
what
are
you
doing
here
she
said
as
he
came
up
enjoying
myself
arent
you
oh
i
come
here
every
day
from
four
to
five
i
dont
think
one
does
any
good
if
one
works
straight
through
may
i
sit
down
for
a
minute
he
said
if
you
want
to
that
doesnt
sound
very
cordial
he
laughed
im
not
much
of
a
one
for
saying
pretty
things
philip
a
little
disconcerted
was
silent
as
he
lit
a
cigarette
did
clutton
say
anything
about
my
work
she
asked
suddenly
no
i
dont
think
he
did
said
philip
hes
no
good
you
know
he
thinks
hes
a
genius
but
he
isnt
hes
too
lazy
for
one
thing
genius
is
an
infinite
capacity
for
taking
pains
the
only
thing
is
to
peg
away
if
one
only
makes
up
ones
mind
badly
enough
to
do
a
thing
one
cant
help
doing
it
she
spoke
with
a
passionate
strenuousness
which
was
rather
striking
she
wore
a
sailor
hat
of
black
straw
a
white
blouse
which
was
not
quite
clean
and
a
brown
skirt
she
had
no
gloves
on
and
her
hands
wanted
washing
she
was
so
unattractive
that
philip
wished
he
had
not
begun
to
talk
to
her
he
could
not
make
out
whether
she
wanted
him
to
stay
or
go
ill
do
anything
i
can
for
you
she
said
all
at
once
without
reference
to
anything
that
had
gone
before
i
know
how
hard
it
is
thank
you
very
much
said
philip
then
in
a
moment
wont
you
come
and
have
tea
with
me
somewhere
she
looked
at
him
quickly
and
flushed
when
she
reddened
her
pasty
skin
acquired
a
curiously
mottled
look
like
strawberries
and
cream
that
had
gone
bad
no
thanks
what
dyou
think
i
want
tea
for
ive
only
just
had
lunch
i
thought
it
would
pass
the
time
said
philip
if
you
find
it
long
you
neednt
bother
about
me
you
know
i
dont
mind
being
left
alone
at
that
moment
two
men
passed
in
brown
velveteens
enormous
trousers
and
basque
caps
they
were
young
but
both
wore
beards
i
say
are
those
artstudents
said
philip
they
might
have
stepped
out
of
the
vie
de
boheme
theyre
americans
said
miss
price
scornfully
frenchmen
havent
worn
things
like
that
for
thirty
years
but
the
americans
from
the
far
west
buy
those
clothes
and
have
themselves
photographed
the
day
after
they
arrive
in
paris
thats
about
as
near
to
art
as
they
ever
get
but
it
doesnt
matter
to
them
theyve
all
got
money
philip
liked
the
daring
picturesqueness
of
the
americans
costume
he
thought
it
showed
the
romantic
spirit
miss
price
asked
him
the
time
i
must
be
getting
along
to
the
studio
she
said
are
you
going
to
the
sketch
classes
philip
did
not
know
anything
about
them
and
she
told
him
that
from
five
to
six
every
evening
a
model
sat
from
whom
anyone
who
liked
could
go
and
draw
at
the
cost
of
fifty
centimes
they
had
a
different
model
every
day
and
it
was
very
good
practice
i
dont
suppose
youre
good
enough
yet
for
that
youd
better
wait
a
bit
i
dont
see
why
i
shouldnt
try
i
havent
got
anything
else
to
do
they
got
up
and
walked
to
the
studio
philip
could
not
tell
from
her
manner
whether
miss
price
wished
him
to
walk
with
her
or
preferred
to
walk
alone
he
remained
from
sheer
embarrassment
not
knowing
how
to
leave
her
but
she
would
not
talk
she
answered
his
questions
in
an
ungracious
manner
a
man
was
standing
at
the
studio
door
with
a
large
dish
into
which
each
person
as
he
went
in
dropped
his
half
franc
the
studio
was
much
fuller
than
it
had
been
in
the
morning
and
there
was
not
the
preponderance
of
english
and
americans
nor
were
women
there
in
so
large
a
proportion
philip
felt
the
assemblage
was
more
the
sort
of
thing
he
had
expected
it
was
very
warm
and
the
air
quickly
grew
fetid
it
was
an
old
man
who
sat
this
time
with
a
vast
gray
beard
and
philip
tried
to
put
into
practice
the
little
he
had
learned
in
the
morning
but
he
made
a
poor
job
of
it
he
realised
that
he
could
not
draw
nearly
as
well
as
he
thought
he
glanced
enviously
at
one
or
two
sketches
of
men
who
sat
near
him
and
wondered
whether
he
would
ever
be
able
to
use
the
charcoal
with
that
mastery
the
hour
passed
quickly
not
wishing
to
press
himself
upon
miss
price
he
sat
down
at
some
distance
from
her
and
at
the
end
as
he
passed
her
on
his
way
out
she
asked
him
brusquely
how
he
had
got
on
not
very
well
he
smiled
if
youd
condescended
to
come
and
sit
near
me
i
could
have
given
you
some
hints
i
suppose
you
thought
yourself
too
grand
no
it
wasnt
that
i
was
afraid
youd
think
me
a
nuisance
when
i
do
that
ill
tell
you
sharp
enough
philip
saw
that
in
her
uncouth
way
she
was
offering
him
help
well
tomorrow
ill
just
force
myself
upon
you
i
dont
mind
she
answered
philip
went
out
and
wondered
what
he
should
do
with
himself
till
dinner
he
was
eager
to
do
something
characteristic
absinthe
of
course
it
was
indicated
and
so
sauntering
towards
the
station
he
seated
himself
outside
a
cafe
and
ordered
it
he
drank
with
nausea
and
satisfaction
he
found
the
taste
disgusting
but
the
moral
effect
magnificent
he
felt
every
inch
an
artstudent
and
since
he
drank
on
an
empty
stomach
his
spirits
presently
grew
very
high
he
watched
the
crowds
and
felt
all
men
were
his
brothers
he
was
happy
when
he
reached
graviers
the
table
at
which
clutton
sat
was
full
but
as
soon
as
he
saw
philip
limping
along
he
called
out
to
him
they
made
room
the
dinner
was
frugal
a
plate
of
soup
a
dish
of
meat
fruit
cheese
and
half
a
bottle
of
wine
but
philip
paid
no
attention
to
what
he
ate
he
took
note
of
the
men
at
the
table
flanagan
was
there
again
he
was
an
american
a
short
snubnosed
youth
with
a
jolly
face
and
a
laughing
mouth
he
wore
a
norfolk
jacket
of
bold
pattern
a
blue
stock
round
his
neck
and
a
tweed
cap
of
fantastic
shape
at
that
time
impressionism
reigned
in
the
latin
quarter
but
its
victory
over
the
older
schools
was
still
recent
and
carolusduran
bouguereau
and
their
like
were
set
up
against
manet
monet
and
degas
to
appreciate
these
was
still
a
sign
of
grace
whistler
was
an
influence
strong
with
the
english
and
his
compatriots
and
the
discerning
collected
japanese
prints
the
old
masters
were
tested
by
new
standards
the
esteem
in
which
raphael
had
been
for
centuries
held
was
a
matter
of
derision
to
wise
young
men
they
offered
to
give
all
his
works
for
velasquez
head
of
philip
iv
in
the
national
gallery
philip
found
that
a
discussion
on
art
was
raging
lawson
whom
he
had
met
at
luncheon
sat
opposite
to
him
he
was
a
thin
youth
with
a
freckled
face
and
red
hair
he
had
very
bright
green
eyes
as
philip
sat
down
he
fixed
them
on
him
and
remarked
suddenly
raphael
was
only
tolerable
when
he
painted
other
peoples
pictures
when
he
painted
peruginos
or
pinturichios
he
was
charming
when
he
painted
raphaels
he
was
with
a
scornful
shrug
raphael
lawson
spoke
so
aggressively
that
philip
was
taken
aback
but
he
was
not
obliged
to
answer
because
flanagan
broke
in
impatiently
oh
to
hell
with
art
he
cried
lets
get
ginny
you
were
ginny
last
night
flanagan
said
lawson
nothing
to
what
i
mean
to
be
tonight
he
answered
fancy
being
in
paris
and
thinking
of
nothing
but
art
all
the
time
he
spoke
with
a
broad
western
accent
my
it
is
good
to
be
alive
he
gathered
himself
together
and
then
banged
his
fist
on
the
table
to
hell
with
art
i
say
you
not
only
say
it
but
you
say
it
with
tiresome
iteration
said
clutton
severely
there
was
another
american
at
the
table
he
was
dressed
like
those
fine
fellows
whom
philip
had
seen
that
afternoon
in
the
luxembourg
he
had
a
handsome
face
thin
ascetic
with
dark
eyes
he
wore
his
fantastic
garb
with
the
dashing
air
of
a
buccaneer
he
had
a
vast
quantity
of
dark
hair
which
fell
constantly
over
his
eyes
and
his
most
frequent
gesture
was
to
throw
back
his
head
dramatically
to
get
some
long
wisp
out
of
the
way
he
began
to
talk
of
the
olympia
by
manet
which
then
hung
in
the
luxembourg
i
stood
in
front
of
it
for
an
hour
today
and
i
tell
you
its
not
a
good
picture
lawson
put
down
his
knife
and
fork
his
green
eyes
flashed
fire
he
gasped
with
rage
but
he
could
be
seen
imposing
calm
upon
himself
its
very
interesting
to
hear
the
mind
of
the
untutored
savage
he
said
will
you
tell
us
why
it
isnt
a
good
picture
before
the
american
could
answer
someone
else
broke
in
vehemently
dyou
mean
to
say
you
can
look
at
the
painting
of
that
flesh
and
say
its
not
good
i
dont
say
that
i
think
the
right
breast
is
very
well
painted
the
right
breast
be
damned
shouted
lawson
the
whole
things
a
miracle
of
painting
he
began
to
describe
in
detail
the
beauties
of
the
picture
but
at
this
table
at
graviers
they
who
spoke
at
length
spoke
for
their
own
edification
no
one
listened
to
him
the
american
interrupted
angrily
you
dont
mean
to
say
you
think
the
heads
good
lawson
white
with
passion
now
began
to
defend
the
head
but
clutton
who
had
been
sitting
in
silence
with
a
look
on
his
face
of
goodhumoured
scorn
broke
in
give
him
the
head
we
dont
want
the
head
it
doesnt
affect
the
picture
all
right
ill
give
you
the
head
cried
lawson
take
the
head
and
be
damned
to
you
what
about
the
black
line
cried
the
american
triumphantly
pushing
back
a
wisp
of
hair
which
nearly
fell
in
his
soup
you
dont
see
a
black
line
round
objects
in
nature
oh
god
send
down
fire
from
heaven
to
consume
the
blasphemer
said
lawson
what
has
nature
got
to
do
with
it
no
one
knows
whats
in
nature
and
what
isnt
the
world
sees
nature
through
the
eyes
of
the
artist
why
for
centuries
it
saw
horses
jumping
a
fence
with
all
their
legs
extended
and
by
heaven
sir
they
were
extended
it
saw
shadows
black
until
monet
discovered
they
were
coloured
and
by
heaven
sir
they
were
black
if
we
choose
to
surround
objects
with
a
black
line
the
world
will
see
the
black
line
and
there
will
be
a
black
line
and
if
we
paint
grass
red
and
cows
blue
itll
see
them
red
and
blue
and
by
heaven
they
will
be
red
and
blue
to
hell
with
art
murmured
flanagan
i
want
to
get
ginny
lawson
took
no
notice
of
the
interruption
now
look
here
when
olympia
was
shown
at
the
salon
zolaamid
the
jeers
of
the
philistines
and
the
hisses
of
the
pompiers
the
academicians
and
the
public
zola
said
i
look
forward
to
the
day
when
manets
picture
will
hang
in
the
louvre
opposite
the
odalisque
of
ingres
and
it
will
not
be
the
odalisque
which
will
gain
by
comparison
itll
be
there
every
day
i
see
the
time
grow
nearer
in
ten
years
the
olympia
will
be
in
the
louvre
never
shouted
the
american
using
both
hands
now
with
a
sudden
desperate
attempt
to
get
his
hair
once
for
all
out
of
the
way
in
ten
years
that
picture
will
be
dead
its
only
a
fashion
of
the
moment
no
picture
can
live
that
hasnt
got
something
which
that
picture
misses
by
a
million
miles
and
what
is
that
great
art
cant
exist
without
a
moral
element
oh
god
cried
lawson
furiously
i
knew
it
was
that
he
wants
morality
he
joined
his
hands
and
held
them
towards
heaven
in
supplication
oh
christopher
columbus
christopher
columbus
what
did
you
do
when
you
discovered
america
ruskin
says
but
before
he
could
add
another
word
clutton
rapped
with
the
handle
of
his
knife
imperiously
on
the
table
gentlemen
he
said
in
a
stern
voice
and
his
huge
nose
positively
wrinkled
with
passion
a
name
has
been
mentioned
which
i
never
thought
to
hear
again
in
decent
society
freedom
of
speech
is
all
very
well
but
we
must
observe
the
limits
of
common
propriety
you
may
talk
of
bouguereau
if
you
will
there
is
a
cheerful
disgustingness
in
the
sound
which
excites
laughter
but
let
us
not
sully
our
chaste
lips
with
the
names
of
j
ruskin
g
f
watts
or
e
b
jones
who
was
ruskin
anyway
asked
flanagan
he
was
one
of
the
great
victorians
he
was
a
master
of
english
style
ruskins
stylea
thing
of
shreds
and
purple
patches
said
lawson
besides
damn
the
great
victorians
whenever
i
open
a
paper
and
see
death
of
a
great
victorian
i
thank
heaven
theres
one
more
of
them
gone
their
only
talent
was
longevity
and
no
artist
should
be
allowed
to
live
after
hes
forty
by
then
a
man
has
done
his
best
work
all
he
does
after
that
is
repetition
dont
you
think
it
was
the
greatest
luck
in
the
world
for
them
that
keats
shelley
bonnington
and
byron
died
early
what
a
genius
we
should
think
swinburne
if
he
had
perished
on
the
day
the
first
series
of
poems
and
ballads
was
published
the
suggestion
pleased
for
no
one
at
the
table
was
more
than
twentyfour
and
they
threw
themselves
upon
it
with
gusto
they
were
unanimous
for
once
they
elaborated
someone
proposed
a
vast
bonfire
made
out
of
the
works
of
the
forty
academicians
into
which
the
great
victorians
might
be
hurled
on
their
fortieth
birthday
the
idea
was
received
with
acclamation
carlyle
and
ruskin
tennyson
browning
g
f
watts
e
b
jones
dickens
thackeray
they
were
hurried
into
the
flames
mr
gladstone
john
bright
and
cobden
there
was
a
moments
discussion
about
george
meredith
but
matthew
arnold
and
emerson
were
given
up
cheerfully
at
last
came
walter
pater
not
walter
pater
murmured
philip
lawson
stared
at
him
for
a
moment
with
his
green
eyes
and
then
nodded
youre
quite
right
walter
pater
is
the
only
justification
for
mona
lisa
dyou
know
cronshaw
he
used
to
know
pater
whos
cronshaw
asked
philip
cronshaws

lets
go
to
the
lilas
la
closerie
des
lilas
was
a
cafe
to
which
they
often
went
in
the
evening
after
dinner
and
here
cronshaw
was
invariably
to
be
found
between
the
hours
of
nine
at
night
and
two
in
the
morning
but
flanagan
had
had
enough
of
intellectual
conversation
for
one
evening
and
when
lawson
made
his
suggestion
turned
to
philip
oh
gee
lets
go
where
there
are
girls
he
said
come
to
the
gaite
montparnasse
and
well
get
ginny
id
rather
go
and
see
cronshaw
and
keep
sober
laughed
philip
chapter
xlii
there
was
a
general
disturbance
flanagan
and
two
or
three
more
went
on
to
the
musichall
while
philip
walked
slowly
with
clutton
and
lawson
to
the
closerie
des
lilas
you
must
go
to
the
gaite
montparnasse
said
lawson
to
him
its
one
of
the
loveliest
things
in
paris
im
going
to
paint
it
one
of
these
days
philip
influenced
by
hayward
looked
upon
musichalls
with
scornful
eyes
but
he
had
reached
paris
at
a
time
when
their
artistic
possibilities
were
just
discovered
the
peculiarities
of
lighting
the
masses
of
dingy
red
and
tarnished
gold
the
heaviness
of
the
shadows
and
the
decorative
lines
offered
a
new
theme
and
half
the
studios
in
the
quarter
contained
sketches
made
in
one
or
other
of
the
local
theatres
men
of
letters
following
in
the
painters
wake
conspired
suddenly
to
find
artistic
value
in
the
turns
and
rednosed
comedians
were
lauded
to
the
skies
for
their
sense
of
character
fat
female
singers
who
had
bawled
obscurely
for
twenty
years
were
discovered
to
possess
inimitable
drollery
there
were
those
who
found
an
aesthetic
delight
in
performing
dogs
while
others
exhausted
their
vocabulary
to
extol
the
distinction
of
conjurers
and
trickcyclists
the
crowd
too
under
another
influence
was
become
an
object
of
sympathetic
interest
with
hayward
philip
had
disdained
humanity
in
the
mass
he
adopted
the
attitude
of
one
who
wraps
himself
in
solitariness
and
watches
with
disgust
the
antics
of
the
vulgar
but
clutton
and
lawson
talked
of
the
multitude
with
enthusiasm
they
described
the
seething
throng
that
filled
the
various
fairs
of
paris
the
sea
of
faces
half
seen
in
the
glare
of
acetylene
half
hidden
in
the
darkness
and
the
blare
of
trumpets
the
hooting
of
whistles
the
hum
of
voices
what
they
said
was
new
and
strange
to
philip
they
told
him
about
cronshaw
have
you
ever
read
any
of
his
work
no
said
philip
it
came
out
in
the
yellow
book
they
looked
upon
him
as
painters
often
do
writers
with
contempt
because
he
was
a
layman
with
tolerance
because
he
practised
an
art
and
with
awe
because
he
used
a
medium
in
which
themselves
felt
illatease
hes
an
extraordinary
fellow
youll
find
him
a
bit
disappointing
at
first
he
only
comes
out
at
his
best
when
hes
drunk
and
the
nuisance
is
added
clutton
that
it
takes
him
a
devil
of
a
time
to
get
drunk
when
they
arrived
at
the
cafe
lawson
told
philip
that
they
would
have
to
go
in
there
was
hardly
a
bite
in
the
autumn
air
but
cronshaw
had
a
morbid
fear
of
draughts
and
even
in
the
warmest
weather
sat
inside
he
knows
everyone
worth
knowing
lawson
explained
he
knew
pater
and
oscar
wilde
and
he
knows
mallarme
and
all
those
fellows
the
object
of
their
search
sat
in
the
most
sheltered
corner
of
the
cafe
with
his
coat
on
and
the
collar
turned
up
he
wore
his
hat
pressed
well
down
on
his
forehead
so
that
he
should
avoid
cold
air
he
was
a
big
man
stout
but
not
obese
with
a
round
face
a
small
moustache
and
little
rather
stupid
eyes
his
head
did
not
seem
quite
big
enough
for
his
body
it
looked
like
a
pea
uneasily
poised
on
an
egg
he
was
playing
dominoes
with
a
frenchman
and
greeted
the
newcomers
with
a
quiet
smile
he
did
not
speak
but
as
if
to
make
room
for
them
pushed
away
the
little
pile
of
saucers
on
the
table
which
indicated
the
number
of
drinks
he
had
already
consumed
he
nodded
to
philip
when
he
was
introduced
to
him
and
went
on
with
the
game
philips
knowledge
of
the
language
was
small
but
he
knew
enough
to
tell
that
cronshaw
although
he
had
lived
in
paris
for
several
years
spoke
french
execrably
at
last
he
leaned
back
with
a
smile
of
triumph
je
vous
ai
battu
he
said
with
an
abominable
accent
garcong
he
called
the
waiter
and
turned
to
philip
just
out
from
england
see
any
cricket
philip
was
a
little
confused
at
the
unexpected
question
cronshaw
knows
the
averages
of
every
firstclass
cricketer
for
the
last
twenty
years
said
lawson
smiling
the
frenchman
left
them
for
friends
at
another
table
and
cronshaw
with
the
lazy
enunciation
which
was
one
of
his
peculiarities
began
to
discourse
on
the
relative
merits
of
kent
and
lancashire
he
told
them
of
the
last
test
match
he
had
seen
and
described
the
course
of
the
game
wicket
by
wicket
thats
the
only
thing
i
miss
in
paris
he
said
as
he
finished
the
bock
which
the
waiter
had
brought
you
dont
get
any
cricket
philip
was
disappointed
and
lawson
pardonably
anxious
to
show
off
one
of
the
celebrities
of
the
quarter
grew
impatient
cronshaw
was
taking
his
time
to
wake
up
that
evening
though
the
saucers
at
his
side
indicated
that
he
had
at
least
made
an
honest
attempt
to
get
drunk
clutton
watched
the
scene
with
amusement
he
fancied
there
was
something
of
affectation
in
cronshaws
minute
knowledge
of
cricket
he
liked
to
tantalise
people
by
talking
to
them
of
things
that
obviously
bored
them
clutton
threw
in
a
question
have
you
seen
mallarme
lately
cronshaw
looked
at
him
slowly
as
if
he
were
turning
the
inquiry
over
in
his
mind
and
before
he
answered
rapped
on
the
marble
table
with
one
of
the
saucers
bring
my
bottle
of
whiskey
he
called
out
he
turned
again
to
philip
i
keep
my
own
bottle
of
whiskey
i
cant
afford
to
pay
fifty
centimes
for
every
thimbleful
the
waiter
brought
the
bottle
and
cronshaw
held
it
up
to
the
light
theyve
been
drinking
it
waiter
whos
been
helping
himself
to
my
whiskey
mais
personne
monsieur
cronshaw
i
made
a
mark
on
it
last
night
and
look
at
it
monsieur
made
a
mark
but
he
kept
on
drinking
after
that
at
that
rate
monsieur
wastes
his
time
in
making
marks
the
waiter
was
a
jovial
fellow
and
knew
cronshaw
intimately
cronshaw
gazed
at
him
if
you
give
me
your
word
of
honour
as
a
nobleman
and
a
gentleman
that
nobody
but
i
has
been
drinking
my
whiskey
ill
accept
your
statement
this
remark
translated
literally
into
the
crudest
french
sounded
very
funny
and
the
lady
at
the
comptoir
could
not
help
laughing
il
est
impayable
she
murmured
cronshaw
hearing
her
turned
a
sheepish
eye
upon
her
she
was
stout
matronly
and
middleaged
and
solemnly
kissed
his
hand
to
her
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
fear
not
madam
he
said
heavily
i
have
passed
the
age
when
i
am
tempted
by
fortyfive
and
gratitude
he
poured
himself
out
some
whiskey
and
water
and
slowly
drank
it
he
wiped
his
mouth
with
the
back
of
his
hand
he
talked
very
well
lawson
and
clutton
knew
that
cronshaws
remark
was
an
answer
to
the
question
about
mallarme
cronshaw
often
went
to
the
gatherings
on
tuesday
evenings
when
the
poet
received
men
of
letters
and
painters
and
discoursed
with
subtle
oratory
on
any
subject
that
was
suggested
to
him
cronshaw
had
evidently
been
there
lately
he
talked
very
well
but
he
talked
nonsense
he
talked
about
art
as
though
it
were
the
most
important
thing
in
the
world
if
it
isnt
what
are
we
here
for
asked
philip
what
youre
here
for
i
dont
know
it
is
no
business
of
mine
but
art
is
a
luxury
men
attach
importance
only
to
selfpreservation
and
the
propagation
of
their
species
it
is
only
when
these
instincts
are
satisfied
that
they
consent
to
occupy
themselves
with
the
entertainment
which
is
provided
for
them
by
writers
painters
and
poets
cronshaw
stopped
for
a
moment
to
drink
he
had
pondered
for
twenty
years
the
problem
whether
he
loved
liquor
because
it
made
him
talk
or
whether
he
loved
conversation
because
it
made
him
thirsty
then
he
said
i
wrote
a
poem
yesterday
without
being
asked
he
began
to
recite
it
very
slowly
marking
the
rhythm
with
an
extended
forefinger
it
was
possibly
a
very
fine
poem
but
at
that
moment
a
young
woman
came
in
she
had
scarlet
lips
and
it
was
plain
that
the
vivid
colour
of
her
cheeks
was
not
due
to
the
vulgarity
of
nature
she
had
blackened
her
eyelashes
and
eyebrows
and
painted
both
eyelids
a
bold
blue
which
was
continued
to
a
triangle
at
the
corner
of
the
eyes
it
was
fantastic
and
amusing
her
dark
hair
was
done
over
her
ears
in
the
fashion
made
popular
by
mlle
cleo
de
merode
philips
eyes
wandered
to
her
and
cronshaw
having
finished
the
recitation
of
his
verses
smiled
upon
him
indulgently
you
were
not
listening
he
said
oh
yes
i
was
i
do
not
blame
you
for
you
have
given
an
apt
illustration
of
the
statement
i
just
made
what
is
art
beside
love
i
respect
and
applaud
your
indifference
to
fine
poetry
when
you
can
contemplate
the
meretricious
charms
of
this
young
person
she
passed
by
the
table
at
which
they
were
sitting
and
he
took
her
arm
come
and
sit
by
my
side
dear
child
and
let
us
play
the
divine
comedy
of
love
fichezmoi
la
paix
she
said
and
pushing
him
on
one
side
continued
her
perambulation
art
he
continued
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
is
merely
the
refuge
which
the
ingenious
have
invented
when
they
were
supplied
with
food
and
women
to
escape
the
tediousness
of
life
cronshaw
filled
his
glass
again
and
began
to
talk
at
length
he
spoke
with
rotund
delivery
he
chose
his
words
carefully
he
mingled
wisdom
and
nonsense
in
the
most
astounding
manner
gravely
making
fun
of
his
hearers
at
one
moment
and
at
the
next
playfully
giving
them
sound
advice
he
talked
of
art
and
literature
and
life
he
was
by
turns
devout
and
obscene
merry
and
lachrymose
he
grew
remarkably
drunk
and
then
he
began
to
recite
poetry
his
own
and
miltons
his
own
and
shelleys
his
own
and
kit
marlowes
at
last
lawson
exhausted
got
up
to
go
home
i
shall
go
too
said
philip
clutton
the
most
silent
of
them
all
remained
behind
listening
with
a
sardonic
smile
on
his
lips
to
cronshaws
maunderings
lawson
accompanied
philip
to
his
hotel
and
then
bade
him
goodnight
but
when
philip
got
to
bed
he
could
not
sleep
all
these
new
ideas
that
had
been
flung
before
him
carelessly
seethed
in
his
brain
he
was
tremendously
excited
he
felt
in
himself
great
powers
he
had
never
before
been
so
selfconfident
i
know
i
shall
be
a
great
artist
he
said
to
himself
i
feel
it
in
me
a
thrill
passed
through
him
as
another
thought
came
but
even
to
himself
he
would
not
put
it
into
words
by
george
i
believe
ive
got
genius
he
was
in
fact
very
drunk
but
as
he
had
not
taken
more
than
one
glass
of
beer
it
could
have
been
due
only
to
a
more
dangerous
intoxicant
than
alcohol
chapter
xliii
on
tuesdays
and
fridays
masters
spent
the
morning
at
amitranos
criticising
the
work
done
in
france
the
painter
earns
little
unless
he
paints
portraits
and
is
patronised
by
rich
americans
and
men
of
reputation
are
glad
to
increase
their
incomes
by
spending
two
or
three
hours
once
a
week
at
one
of
the
numerous
studios
where
art
is
taught
tuesday
was
the
day
upon
which
michel
rollin
came
to
amitranos
he
was
an
elderly
man
with
a
white
beard
and
a
florid
complexion
who
had
painted
a
number
of
decorations
for
the
state
but
these
were
an
object
of
derision
to
the
students
he
instructed
he
was
a
disciple
of
ingres
impervious
to
the
progress
of
art
and
angrily
impatient
with
that
tas
de
farceurs
whose
names
were
manet
degas
monet
and
sisley
but
he
was
an
excellent
teacher
helpful
polite
and
encouraging
foinet
on
the
other
hand
who
visited
the
studio
on
fridays
was
a
difficult
man
to
get
on
with
he
was
a
small
shrivelled
person
with
bad
teeth
and
a
bilious
air
an
untidy
gray
beard
and
savage
eyes
his
voice
was
high
and
his
tone
sarcastic
he
had
had
pictures
bought
by
the
luxembourg
and
at
twentyfive
looked
forward
to
a
great
career
but
his
talent
was
due
to
youth
rather
than
to
personality
and
for
twenty
years
he
had
done
nothing
but
repeat
the
landscape
which
had
brought
him
his
early
success
when
he
was
reproached
with
monotony
he
answered
corot
only
painted
one
thing
why
shouldnt
i
he
was
envious
of
everyone
elses
success
and
had
a
peculiar
personal
loathing
of
the
impressionists
for
he
looked
upon
his
own
failure
as
due
to
the
mad
fashion
which
had
attracted
the
public
sale
bete
to
their
works
the
genial
disdain
of
michel
rollin
who
called
them
impostors
was
answered
by
him
with
vituperation
of
which
crapule
and
canaille
were
the
least
violent
items
he
amused
himself
with
abuse
of
their
private
lives
and
with
sardonic
humour
with
blasphemous
and
obscene
detail
attacked
the
legitimacy
of
their
births
and
the
purity
of
their
conjugal
relations
he
used
an
oriental
imagery
and
an
oriental
emphasis
to
accentuate
his
ribald
scorn
nor
did
he
conceal
his
contempt
for
the
students
whose
work
he
examined
by
them
he
was
hated
and
feared
the
women
by
his
brutal
sarcasm
he
reduced
often
to
tears
which
again
aroused
his
ridicule
and
he
remained
at
the
studio
notwithstanding
the
protests
of
those
who
suffered
too
bitterly
from
his
attacks
because
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
he
was
one
of
the
best
masters
in
paris
sometimes
the
old
model
who
kept
the
school
ventured
to
remonstrate
with
him
but
his
expostulations
quickly
gave
way
before
the
violent
insolence
of
the
painter
to
abject
apologies
it
was
foinet
with
whom
philip
first
came
in
contact
he
was
already
in
the
studio
when
philip
arrived
he
went
round
from
easel
to
easel
with
mrs
otter
the
massiere
by
his
side
to
interpret
his
remarks
for
the
benefit
of
those
who
could
not
understand
french
fanny
price
sitting
next
to
philip
was
working
feverishly
her
face
was
sallow
with
nervousness
and
every
now
and
then
she
stopped
to
wipe
her
hands
on
her
blouse
for
they
were
hot
with
anxiety
suddenly
she
turned
to
philip
with
an
anxious
look
which
she
tried
to
hide
by
a
sullen
frown
dyou
think
its
good
she
asked
nodding
at
her
drawing
philip
got
up
and
looked
at
it
he
was
astounded
he
felt
she
must
have
no
eye
at
all
the
thing
was
hopelessly
out
of
drawing
i
wish
i
could
draw
half
as
well
myself
he
answered
you
cant
expect
to
youve
only
just
come
its
a
bit
too
much
to
expect
that
you
should
draw
as
well
as
i
do
ive
been
here
two
years
fanny
price
puzzled
philip
her
conceit
was
stupendous
philip
had
already
discovered
that
everyone
in
the
studio
cordially
disliked
her
and
it
was
no
wonder
for
she
seemed
to
go
out
of
her
way
to
wound
people
i
complained
to
mrs
otter
about
foinet
she
said
now
the
last
two
weeks
he
hasnt
looked
at
my
drawings
he
spends
about
half
an
hour
on
mrs
otter
because
shes
the
massiere
after
all
i
pay
as
much
as
anybody
else
and
i
suppose
my
moneys
as
good
as
theirs
i
dont
see
why
i
shouldnt
get
as
much
attention
as
anybody
else
she
took
up
her
charcoal
again
but
in
a
moment
put
it
down
with
a
groan
i
cant
do
any
more
now
im
so
frightfully
nervous
she
looked
at
foinet
who
was
coming
towards
them
with
mrs
otter
mrs
otter
meek
mediocre
and
selfsatisfied
wore
an
air
of
importance
foinet
sat
down
at
the
easel
of
an
untidy
little
englishwoman
called
ruth
chalice
she
had
the
fine
black
eyes
languid
but
passionate
the
thin
face
ascetic
but
sensual
the
skin
like
old
ivory
which
under
the
influence
of
burnejones
were
cultivated
at
that
time
by
young
ladies
in
chelsea
foinet
seemed
in
a
pleasant
mood
he
did
not
say
much
to
her
but
with
quick
determined
strokes
of
her
charcoal
pointed
out
her
errors
miss
chalice
beamed
with
pleasure
when
he
rose
he
came
to
clutton
and
by
this
time
philip
was
nervous
too
but
mrs
otter
had
promised
to
make
things
easy
for
him
foinet
stood
for
a
moment
in
front
of
cluttons
work
biting
his
thumb
silently
then
absentmindedly
spat
out
upon
the
canvas
the
little
piece
of
skin
which
he
had
bitten
off
thats
a
fine
line
he
said
at
last
indicating
with
his
thumb
what
pleased
him
youre
beginning
to
learn
to
draw
clutton
did
not
answer
but
looked
at
the
master
with
his
usual
air
of
sardonic
indifference
to
the
worlds
opinion
im
beginning
to
think
you
have
at
least
a
trace
of
talent
mrs
otter
who
did
not
like
clutton
pursed
her
lips
she
did
not
see
anything
out
of
the
way
in
his
work
foinet
sat
down
and
went
into
technical
details
mrs
otter
grew
rather
tired
of
standing
clutton
did
not
say
anything
but
nodded
now
and
then
and
foinet
felt
with
satisfaction
that
he
grasped
what
he
said
and
the
reasons
of
it
most
of
them
listened
to
him
but
it
was
clear
they
never
understood
then
foinet
got
up
and
came
to
philip
he
only
arrived
two
days
ago
mrs
otter
hurried
to
explain
hes
a
beginner
hes
never
studied
before
ca
se
voit
the
master
said
one
sees
that
he
passed
on
and
mrs
otter
murmured
to
him
this
is
the
young
lady
i
told
you
about
he
looked
at
her
as
though
she
were
some
repulsive
animal
and
his
voice
grew
more
rasping
it
appears
that
you
do
not
think
i
pay
enough
attention
to
you
you
have
been
complaining
to
the
massiere
well

work
to
which
you
wish
me
to
give
attention
fanny
price
coloured
the
blood
under
her
unhealthy
skin
seemed
to
be
of
a
strange
purple
without
answering
she
pointed
to
the
drawing
on
which
she
had
been
at
work
since
the
beginning
of
the
week
foinet
sat
down
well
what

wish
me
to
say
to
you

me
to

up
are
you
satisfied
now
miss
price
became
very
white
she
was
furious
because
he
had
said
all
this
before
mrs
otter
though
she
had
been
in
france
so
long
and
could
understand
french
well
enough
she
could
hardly
speak
two
words
hes
got
no
right
to
treat
me
like
that
my
moneys
as
good
as
anyone
elses
i
pay
him
to
teach
me
thats
not
teaching
me
what
does
she
say
what
does
she
say
asked
foinet
mrs
otter
hesitated
to
translate
and
miss
price
repeated
in
execrable
french
je
vous
paye
pour
mapprendre
his
eyes
flashed
with
rage
he
raised
his
voice
and
shook
his
fist
mais
nom
de
dieu
i
cant
teach
you
i
could
more
easily
teach
a
camel
he
turned
to
mrs
otter
ask
her
does
she
do
this
for
amusement
or
does
she
expect
to
earn
money
by
it
im
going
to
earn
my
living
as
an
artist
miss
price
answered
then
it
is
my
duty
to
tell
you
that
you
are
wasting
your
time
it
would
not
matter
that
you
have
no
talent
talent
does
not
run
about
the
streets
in
these
days
but
you
have
not
the
beginning
of
an
aptitude
how
long
have
you
been
here
a
child
of
five
after
two
lessons
would
draw
better
than
you
do
i
only
say
one
thing
to
you
give
up
this
hopeless
attempt
youre
more
likely
to
earn
your
living
as
a
bonne
a
tout
faire
than
as
a
painter
look
he
seized
a
piece
of
charcoal
and
it
broke
as
he
applied
it
to
the
paper
he
cursed
and
with
the
stump
drew
great
firm
lines
he
drew
rapidly
and
spoke
at
the
same
time
spitting
out
the
words
with
venom
look
those
arms
are
not
the
same
length
that
knee
its
grotesque
i
tell
you
a
child
of
five
you
see
shes
not
standing
on
her
legs
that
foot
with
each
word
the
angry
pencil
made
a
mark
and
in
a
moment
the
drawing
upon
which
fanny
price
had
spent
so
much
time
and
eager
trouble
was
unrecognisable
a
confusion
of
lines
and
smudges
at
last
he
flung
down
the
charcoal
and
stood
up
take
my
advice
mademoiselle
try
dressmaking
he
looked
at
his
watch
its
twelve
a
la
semaine
prochaine
messieurs
miss
price
gathered
up
her
things
slowly
philip
waited
behind
after
the
others
to
say
to
her
something
consolatory
he
could
think
of
nothing
but
i
say
im
awfully
sorry
what
a
beast
that
man
is
she
turned
on
him
savagely
is
that
what
youre
waiting
about
for
when
i
want
your
sympathy
ill
ask
for
it
please
get
out
of
my
way
she
walked
past
him
out
of
the
studio
and
philip
with
a
shrug
of
the
shoulders
limped
along
to
graviers
for
luncheon
it
served
her
right
said
lawson
when
philip
told
him
what
had
happened
illtempered
slut
lawson
was
very
sensitive
to
criticism
and
in
order
to
avoid
it
never
went
to
the
studio
when
foinet
was
coming
i
dont
want
other
peoples
opinion
of
my
work
he
said
i
know
myself
if
its
good
or
bad
you
mean
you
dont
want
other
peoples
bad
opinion
of
your
work
answered
clutton
dryly
in
the
afternoon
philip
thought
he
would
go
to
the
luxembourg
to
see
the
pictures
and
walking
through
the
garden
he
saw
fanny
price
sitting
in
her
accustomed
seat
he
was
sore
at
the
rudeness
with
which
she
had
met
his
wellmeant
attempt
to
say
something
pleasant
and
passed
as
though
he
had
not
caught
sight
of
her
but
she
got
up
at
once
and
came
towards
him
are
you
trying
to
cut
me
she
said
no
of
course
not
i
thought
perhaps
you
didnt
want
to
be
spoken
to
where
are
you
going
i
wanted
to
have
a
look
at
the
manet
ive
heard
so
much
about
it
would
you
like
me
to
come
with
you
i
know
the
luxembourg
rather
well
i
could
show
you
one
or
two
good
things
he
understood
that
unable
to
bring
herself
to
apologise
directly
she
made
this
offer
as
amends
its
awfully
kind
of
you
i
should
like
it
very
much
you
neednt
say
yes
if
youd
rather
go
alone
she
said
suspiciously
i
wouldnt
they
walked
towards
the
gallery
caillebottes
collection
had
lately
been
placed
on
view
and
the
student
for
the
first
time
had
the
opportunity
to
examine
at
his
ease
the
works
of
the
impressionists
till
then
it
had
been
possible
to
see
them
only
at
durandruels
shop
in
the
rue
lafitte
and
the
dealer
unlike
his
fellows
in
england
who
adopt
towards
the
painter
an
attitude
of
superiority
was
always
pleased
to
show
the
shabbiest
student
whatever
he
wanted
to
see
or
at
his
private
house
to
which
it
was
not
difficult
to
get
a
card
of
admission
on
tuesdays
and
where
you
might
see
pictures
of
worldwide
reputation
miss
price
led
philip
straight
up
to
manets
olympia
he
looked
at
it
in
astonished
silence
do
you
like
it
asked
miss
price
i
dont
know
he
answered
helplessly
you
can
take
it
from
me
that
its
the
best
thing
in
the
gallery
except
perhaps
whistlers
portrait
of
his
mother
she
gave
him
a
certain
time
to
contemplate
the
masterpiece
and
then
took
him
to
a
picture
representing
a
railwaystation
look
heres
a
monet
she
said
its
the
gare
st
lazare
but
the
railway
lines
arent
parallel
said
philip
what
does
that
matter
she
asked
with
a
haughty
air
philip
felt
ashamed
of
himself
fanny
price
had
picked
up
the
glib
chatter
of
the
studios
and
had
no
difficulty
in
impressing
philip
with
the
extent
of
her
knowledge
she
proceeded
to
explain
the
pictures
to
him
superciliously
but
not
without
insight
and
showed
him
what
the
painters
had
attempted
and
what
he
must
look
for
she
talked
with
much
gesticulation
of
the
thumb
and
philip
to
whom
all
she
said
was
new
listened
with
profound
but
bewildered
interest
till
now
he
had
worshipped
watts
and
burnejones
the
pretty
colour
of
the
first
the
affected
drawing
of
the
second
had
entirely
satisfied
his
aesthetic
sensibilities
their
vague
idealism
the
suspicion
of
a
philosophical
idea
which
underlay
the
titles
they
gave
their
pictures
accorded
very
well
with
the
functions
of
art
as
from
his
diligent
perusal
of
ruskin
he
understood
it
but
here
was
something
quite
different
here
was
no
moral
appeal
and
the
contemplation
of
these
works
could
help
no
one
to
lead
a
purer
and
a
higher
life
he
was
puzzled
at
last
he
said
you
know
im
simply
dead
i
dont
think
i
can
absorb
anything
more
profitably
lets
go
and
sit
down
on
one
of
the
benches
its
better
not
to
take
too
much
art
at
a
time
miss
price
answered
when
they
got
outside
he
thanked
her
warmly
for
the
trouble
she
had
taken
oh
thats
all
right
she
said
a
little
ungraciously
i
do
it
because
i
enjoy
it
well
go
to
the
louvre
tomorrow
if
you
like
and
then
ill
take
you
to
durandruels
youre
really
awfully
good
to
me
you
dont
think
me
such
a
beast
as
the
most
of
them
do
i
dont
he
smiled
they
think
theyll
drive
me
away
from
the
studio
but
they
wont
i
shall
stay
there
just
exactly
as
long
as
it
suits
me
all
that
this
morning
it
was
lucy
otters
doing
i
know
it
was
she
always
has
hated
me
she
thought
after
that
id
take
myself
off
i
daresay
shed
like
me
to
go
shes
afraid
i
know
too
much
about
her
miss
price
told
him
a
long
involved
story
which
made
out
that
mrs
otter
a
humdrum
and
respectable
little
person
had
scabrous
intrigues
then
she
talked
of
ruth
chalice
the
girl
whom
foinet
had
praised
that
morning
shes
been
with
every
one
of
the
fellows
at
the
studio
shes
nothing
better
than
a
streetwalker
and
shes
dirty
she
hasnt
had
a
bath
for
a
month
i
know
it
for
a
fact
philip
listened
uncomfortably
he
had
heard
already
that
various
rumours
were
in
circulation
about
miss
chalice
but
it
was
ridiculous
to
suppose
that
mrs
otter
living
with
her
mother
was
anything
but
rigidly
virtuous
the
woman
walking
by
his
side
with
her
malignant
lying
positively
horrified
him
i
dont
care
what
they
say
i
shall
go
on
just
the
same
i
know
ive
got
it
in
me
i
feel
im
an
artist
id
sooner
kill
myself
than
give
it
up
oh
i
shant
be
the
first
theyve
all
laughed
at
in
the
schools
and
then
hes
turned
out
the
only
genius
of
the
lot
arts
the
only
thing
i
care
for
im
willing
to
give
my
whole
life
to
it
its
only
a
question
of
sticking
to
it
and
pegging
away
she
found
discreditable
motives
for
everyone
who
would
not
take
her
at
her
own
estimate
of
herself
she
detested
clutton
she
told
philip
that
his
friend
had
no
talent
really
it
was
just
flashy
and
superficial
he
couldnt
compose
a
figure
to
save
his
life
and
lawson
little
beast
with
his
red
hair
and
his
freckles
hes
so
afraid
of
foinet
that
he
wont
let
him
see
his
work
after
all
i
dont
funk
it
do
i
i
dont
care
what
foinet
says
to
me
i
know
im
a
real
artist
they
reached
the
street
in
which
she
lived
and
with
a
sigh
of
relief
philip
left
her
chapter
xliv
but
notwithstanding
when
miss
price
on
the
following
sunday
offered
to
take
him
to
the
louvre
philip
accepted
she
showed
him
mona
lisa
he
looked
at
it
with
a
slight
feeling
of
disappointment
but
he
had
read
till
he
knew
by
heart
the
jewelled
words
with
which
walter
pater
has
added
beauty
to
the
most
famous
picture
in
the
world
and
these
now
he
repeated
to
miss
price
thats
all
literature
she
said
a
little
contemptuously
you
must
get
away
from
that
she
showed
him
the
rembrandts
and
she
said
many
appropriate
things
about
them
she
stood
in
front
of
the
disciples
at
emmaus
when
you
feel
the
beauty
of
that
she
said
youll
know
something
about
painting
she
showed
him
the
odalisque
and
la
source
of
ingres
fanny
price
was
a
peremptory
guide
she
would
not
let
him
look
at
the
things
he
wished
and
attempted
to
force
his
admiration
for
all
she
admired
she
was
desperately
in
earnest
with
her
study
of
art
and
when
philip
passing
in
the
long
gallery
a
window
that
looked
out
on
the
tuileries
gay
sunny
and
urbane
like
a
picture
by
raffaelli
exclaimed
i
say
how
jolly
do
lets
stop
here
a
minute
she
said
indifferently
yes
its
all
right
but
weve
come
here
to
look
at
pictures
the
autumn
air
blithe
and
vivacious
elated
philip
and
when
towards
midday
they
stood
in
the
great
courtyard
of
the
louvre
he
felt
inclined
to
cry
like
flanagan
to
hell
with
art
i
say
do
lets
go
to
one
of
those
restaurants
in
the
boul
mich
and
have
a
snack
together
shall
we
he
suggested
miss
price
gave
him
a
suspicious
look
ive
got
my
lunch
waiting
for
me
at
home
she
answered
that
doesnt
matter
you
can
eat
it
tomorrow
do
let
me
stand
you
a
lunch
i
dont
know
why
you
want
to
it
would
give
me
pleasure
he
replied
smiling
they
crossed
the
river
and
at
the
corner
of
the
boulevard
st
michel
there
was
a
restaurant
lets
go
in
there
no
i
wont
go
there
it
looks
too
expensive
she
walked
on
firmly
and
philip
was
obliged
to
follow
a
few
steps
brought
them
to
a
smaller
restaurant
where
a
dozen
people
were
already
lunching
on
the
pavement
under
an
awning
on
the
window
was
announced
in
large
white
letters
dejeuner

vin
compris
we
couldnt
have
anything
cheaper
than
this
and
it
looks
quite
all
right
they
sat
down
at
a
vacant
table
and
waited
for
the
omelette
which
was
the
first
article
on
the
bill
of
fare
philip
gazed
with
delight
upon
the
passersby
his
heart
went
out
to
them
he
was
tired
but
very
happy
i
say
look
at
that
man
in
the
blouse
isnt
he
ripping
he
glanced
at
miss
price
and
to
his
astonishment
saw
that
she
was
looking
down
at
her
plate
regardless
of
the
passing
spectacle
and
two
heavy
tears
were
rolling
down
her
cheeks
what
on
earths
the
matter
he
exclaimed
if
you
say
anything
to
me
i
shall
get
up
and
go
at
once
she
answered
he
was
entirely
puzzled
but
fortunately
at
that
moment
the
omelette
came
he
divided
it
in
two
and
they
began
to
eat
philip
did
his
best
to
talk
of
indifferent
things
and
it
seemed
as
though
miss
price
were
making
an
effort
on
her
side
to
be
agreeable
but
the
luncheon
was
not
altogether
a
success
philip
was
squeamish
and
the
way
in
which
miss
price
ate
took
his
appetite
away
she
ate
noisily
greedily
a
little
like
a
wild
beast
in
a
menagerie
and
after
she
had
finished
each
course
rubbed
the
plate
with
pieces
of
bread
till
it
was
white
and
shining
as
if
she
did
not
wish
to
lose
a
single
drop
of
gravy
they
had
camembert
cheese
and
it
disgusted
philip
to
see
that
she
ate
rind
and
all
of
the
portion
that
was
given
her
she
could
not
have
eaten
more
ravenously
if
she
were
starving
miss
price
was
unaccountable
and
having
parted
from
her
on
one
day
with
friendliness
he
could
never
tell
whether
on
the
next
she
would
not
be
sulky
and
uncivil
but
he
learned
a
good
deal
from
her
though
she
could
not
draw
well
herself
she
knew
all
that
could
be
taught
and
her
constant
suggestions
helped
his
progress
mrs
otter
was
useful
to
him
too
and
sometimes
miss
chalice
criticised
his
work
he
learned
from
the
glib
loquacity
of
lawson
and
from
the
example
of
clutton
but
fanny
price
hated
him
to
take
suggestions
from
anyone
but
herself
and
when
he
asked
her
help
after
someone
else
had
been
talking
to
him
she
would
refuse
with
brutal
rudeness
the
other
fellows
lawson
clutton
flanagan
chaffed
him
about
her
you
be
careful
my
lad
they
said
shes
in
love
with
you
oh
what
nonsense
he
laughed
the
thought
that
miss
price
could
be
in
love
with
anyone
was
preposterous
it
made
him
shudder
when
he
thought
of
her
uncomeliness
the
bedraggled
hair
and
the
dirty
hands
the
brown
dress
she
always
wore
stained
and
ragged
at
the
hem
he
supposed
she
was
hard
up
they
were
all
hard
up
but
she
might
at
least
be
clean
and
it
was
surely
possible
with
a
needle
and
thread
to
make
her
skirt
tidy
philip
began
to
sort
his
impressions
of
the
people
he
was
thrown
in
contact
with
he
was
not
so
ingenuous
as
in
those
days
which
now
seemed
so
long
ago
at
heidelberg
and
beginning
to
take
a
more
deliberate
interest
in
humanity
he
was
inclined
to
examine
and
to
criticise
he
found
it
difficult
to
know
clutton
any
better
after
seeing
him
every
day
for
three
months
than
on
the
first
day
of
their
acquaintance
the
general
impression
at
the
studio
was
that
he
was
able
it
was
supposed
that
he
would
do
great
things
and
he
shared
the
general
opinion
but
what
exactly
he
was
going
to
do
neither
he
nor
anybody
else
quite
knew
he
had
worked
at
several
studios
before
amitranos
at
julians
the
beaux
arts
and
macphersons
and
was
remaining
longer
at
amitranos
than
anywhere
because
he
found
himself
more
left
alone
he
was
not
fond
of
showing
his
work
and
unlike
most
of
the
young
men
who
were
studying
art
neither
sought
nor
gave
advice
it
was
said
that
in
the
little
studio
in
the
rue
campagne
premiere
which
served
him
for
workroom
and
bedroom
he
had
wonderful
pictures
which
would
make
his
reputation
if
only
he
could
be
induced
to
exhibit
them
he
could
not
afford
a
model
but
painted
still
life
and
lawson
constantly
talked
of
a
plate
of
apples
which
he
declared
was
a
masterpiece
he
was
fastidious
and
aiming
at
something
he
did
not
quite
fully
grasp
was
constantly
dissatisfied
with
his
work
as
a
whole
perhaps
a
part
would
please
him
the
forearm
or
the
leg
and
foot
of
a
figure
a
glass
or
a
cup
in
a
stilllife
and
he
would
cut
this
out
and
keep
it
destroying
the
rest
of
the
canvas
so
that
when
people
invited
themselves
to
see
his
work
he
could
truthfully
answer
that
he
had
not
a
single
picture
to
show
in
brittany
he
had
come
across
a
painter
whom
nobody
else
had
heard
of
a
queer
fellow
who
had
been
a
stockbroker
and
taken
up
painting
at
middleage
and
he
was
greatly
influenced
by
his
work
he
was
turning
his
back
on
the
impressionists
and
working
out
for
himself
painfully
an
individual
way
not
only
of
painting
but
of
seeing
philip
felt
in
him
something
strangely
original
at
graviers
where
they
ate
and
in
the
evening
at
the
versailles
or
at
the
closerie
des
lilas
clutton
was
inclined
to
taciturnity
he
sat
quietly
with
a
sardonic
expression
on
his
gaunt
face
and
spoke
only
when
the
opportunity
occurred
to
throw
in
a
witticism
he
liked
a
butt
and
was
most
cheerful
when
someone
was
there
on
whom
he
could
exercise
his
sarcasm
he
seldom
talked
of
anything
but
painting
and
then
only
with
the
one
or
two
persons
whom
he
thought
worth
while
philip
wondered
whether
there
was
in
him
really
anything
his
reticence
the
haggard
look
of
him
the
pungent
humour
seemed
to
suggest
personality
but
might
be
no
more
than
an
effective
mask
which
covered
nothing
with
lawson
on
the
other
hand
philip
soon
grew
intimate
he
had
a
variety
of
interests
which
made
him
an
agreeable
companion
he
read
more
than
most
of
the
students
and
though
his
income
was
small
loved
to
buy
books
he
lent
them
willingly
and
philip
became
acquainted
with
flaubert
and
balzac
with
verlaine
heredia
and
villiers
de
lisle
adam
they
went
to
plays
together
and
sometimes
to
the
gallery
of
the
opera
comique
there
was
the
odeon
quite
near
them
and
philip
soon
shared
his
friends
passion
for
the
tragedians
of
louis
xiv
and
the
sonorous
alexandrine
in
the
rue
taitbout
were
the
concerts
rouge
where
for
seventyfive
centimes
they
could
hear
excellent
music
and
get
into
the
bargain
something
which
it
was
quite
possible
to
drink
the
seats
were
uncomfortable
the
place
was
crowded
the
air
thick
with
caporal
horrible
to
breathe
but
in
their
young
enthusiasm
they
were
indifferent
sometimes
they
went
to
the
bal
bullier
on
these
occasions
flanagan
accompanied
them
his
excitability
and
his
roisterous
enthusiasm
made
them
laugh
he
was
an
excellent
dancer
and
before
they
had
been
ten
minutes
in
the
room
he
was
prancing
round
with
some
little
shopgirl
whose
acquaintance
he
had
just
made
the
desire
of
all
of
them
was
to
have
a
mistress
it
was
part
of
the
paraphernalia
of
the
artstudent
in
paris
it
gave
consideration
in
the
eyes
of
ones
fellows
it
was
something
to
boast
about
but
the
difficulty
was
that
they
had
scarcely
enough
money
to
keep
themselves
and
though
they
argued
that
frenchwomen
were
so
clever
it
cost
no
more
to
keep
two
then
one
they
found
it
difficult
to
meet
young
women
who
were
willing
to
take
that
view
of
the
circumstances
they
had
to
content
themselves
for
the
most
part
with
envying
and
abusing
the
ladies
who
received
protection
from
painters
of
more
settled
respectability
than
their
own
it
was
extraordinary
how
difficult
these
things
were
in
paris
lawson
would
become
acquainted
with
some
young
thing
and
make
an
appointment
for
twentyfour
hours
he
would
be
all
in
a
flutter
and
describe
the
charmer
at
length
to
everyone
he
met
but
she
never
by
any
chance
turned
up
at
the
time
fixed
he
would
come
to
graviers
very
late
illtempered
and
exclaim
confound
it
another
rabbit
i
dont
know
why
it
is
they
dont
like
me
i
suppose
its
because
i
dont
speak
french
well
or
my
red
hair
its
too
sickening
to
have
spent
over
a
year
in
paris
without
getting
hold
of
anyone
you
dont
go
the
right
way
to
work
said
flanagan
he
had
a
long
and
enviable
list
of
triumphs
to
narrate
and
though
they
took
leave
not
to
believe
all
he
said
evidence
forced
them
to
acknowledge
that
he
did
not
altogether
lie
but
he
sought
no
permanent
arrangement
he
only
had
two
years
in
paris
he
had
persuaded
his
people
to
let
him
come
and
study
art
instead
of
going
to
college
but
at
the
end
of
that
period
he
was
to
return
to
seattle
and
go
into
his
fathers
business
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
get
as
much
fun
as
possible
into
the
time
and
demanded
variety
rather
than
duration
in
his
love
affairs
i
dont
know
how
you
get
hold
of
them
said
lawson
furiously
theres
no
difficulty
about
that
sonny
answered
flanagan
you
just
go
right
in
the
difficulty
is
to
get
rid
of
them
thats
where
you
want
tact
philip
was
too
much
occupied
with
his
work
the
books
he
was
reading
the
plays
he
saw
the
conversation
he
listened
to
to
trouble
himself
with
the
desire
for
female
society
he
thought
there
would
be
plenty
of
time
for
that
when
he
could
speak
french
more
glibly
it
was
more
than
a
year
now
since
he
had
seen
miss
wilkinson
and
during
his
first
weeks
in
paris
he
had
been
too
busy
to
answer
a
letter
she
had
written
to
him
just
before
he
left
blackstable
when
another
came
knowing
it
would
be
full
of
reproaches
and
not
being
just
then
in
the
mood
for
them
he
put
it
aside
intending
to
open
it
later
but
he
forgot
and
did
not
run
across
it
till
a
month
afterwards
when
he
was
turning
out
a
drawer
to
find
some
socks
that
had
no
holes
in
them
he
looked
at
the
unopened
letter
with
dismay
he
was
afraid
that
miss
wilkinson
had
suffered
a
good
deal
and
it
made
him
feel
a
brute
but
she
had
probably
got
over
the
suffering
by
now
at
all
events
the
worst
of
it
it
suggested
itself
to
him
that
women
were
often
very
emphatic
in
their
expressions
these
did
not
mean
so
much
as
when
men
used
them
he
had
quite
made
up
his
mind
that
nothing
would
induce
him
ever
to
see
her
again
he
had
not
written
for
so
long
that
it
seemed
hardly
worth
while
to
write
now
he
made
up
his
mind
not
to
read
the
letter
i
daresay
she
wont
write
again
he
said
to
himself
she
cant
help
seeing
the
things
over
after
all
she
was
old
enough
to
be
my
mother
she
ought
to
have
known
better
for
an
hour
or
two
he
felt
a
little
uncomfortable
his
attitude
was
obviously
the
right
one
but
he
could
not
help
a
feeling
of
dissatisfaction
with
the
whole
business
miss
wilkinson
however
did
not
write
again
nor
did
she
as
he
absurdly
feared
suddenly
appear
in
paris
to
make
him
ridiculous
before
his
friends
in
a
little
while
he
clean
forgot
her
meanwhile
he
definitely
forsook
his
old
gods
the
amazement
with
which
at
first
he
had
looked
upon
the
works
of
the
impressionists
changed
to
admiration
and
presently
he
found
himself
talking
as
emphatically
as
the
rest
on
the
merits
of
manet
monet
and
degas
he
bought
a
photograph
of
a
drawing
by
ingres
of
the
odalisque
and
a
photograph
of
the
olympia
they
were
pinned
side
by
side
over
his
washingstand
so
that
he
could
contemplate
their
beauty
while
he
shaved
he
knew
now
quite
positively
that
there
had
been
no
painting
of
landscape
before
monet
and
he
felt
a
real
thrill
when
he
stood
in
front
of
rembrandts
disciples
at
emmaus
or
velasquez
lady
with
the
fleabitten
nose
that
was
not
her
real
name
but
by
that
she
was
distinguished
at
graviers
to
emphasise
the
pictures
beauty
notwithstanding
the
somewhat
revolting
peculiarity
of
the
sitters
appearance
with
ruskin
burnejones
and
watts
he
had
put
aside
his
bowler
hat
and
the
neat
blue
tie
with
white
spots
which
he
had
worn
on
coming
to
paris
and
now
disported
himself
in
a
soft
broadbrimmed
hat
a
flowing
black
cravat
and
a
cape
of
romantic
cut
he
walked
along
the
boulevard
du
montparnasse
as
though
he
had
known
it
all
his
life
and
by
virtuous
perseverance
he
had
learnt
to
drink
absinthe
without
distaste
he
was
letting
his
hair
grow
and
it
was
only
because
nature
is
unkind
and
has
no
regard
for
the
immortal
longings
of
youth
that
he
did
not
attempt
a
beard
chapter
xlv
philip
soon
realised
that
the
spirit
which
informed
his
friends
was
cronshaws
it
was
from
him
that
lawson
got
his
paradoxes
and
even
clutton
who
strained
after
individuality
expressed
himself
in
the
terms
he
had
insensibly
acquired
from
the
older
man
it
was
his
ideas
that
they
bandied
about
at
table
and
on
his
authority
they
formed
their
judgments
they
made
up
for
the
respect
with
which
unconsciously
they
treated
him
by
laughing
at
his
foibles
and
lamenting
his
vices
of
course
poor
old
cronshaw
will
never
do
any
good
they
said
hes
quite
hopeless
they
prided
themselves
on
being
alone
in
appreciating
his
genius
and
though
with
the
contempt
of
youth
for
the
follies
of
middleage
they
patronised
him
among
themselves
they
did
not
fail
to
look
upon
it
as
a
feather
in
their
caps
if
he
had
chosen
a
time
when
only
one
was
there
to
be
particularly
wonderful
cronshaw
never
came
to
graviers
for
the
last
four
years
he
had
lived
in
squalid
conditions
with
a
woman
whom
only
lawson
had
once
seen
in
a
tiny
apartment
on
the
sixth
floor
of
one
of
the
most
dilapidated
houses
on
the
quai
des
grands
augustins
lawson
described
with
gusto
the
filth
the
untidiness
the
litter
and
the
stink
nearly
blew
your
head
off
not
at
dinner
lawson
expostulated
one
of
the
others
but
he
would
not
deny
himself
the
pleasure
of
giving
picturesque
details
of
the
odours
which
met
his
nostril
with
a
fierce
delight
in
his
own
realism
he
described
the
woman
who
had
opened
the
door
for
him
she
was
dark
small
and
fat
quite
young
with
black
hair
that
seemed
always
on
the
point
of
coming
down
she
wore
a
slatternly
blouse
and
no
corsets
with
her
red
cheeks
large
sensual
mouth
and
shining
lewd
eyes
she
reminded
you
of
the
bohemienne
in
the
louvre
by
franz
hals
she
had
a
flaunting
vulgarity
which
amused
and
yet
horrified
a
scrubby
unwashed
baby
was
playing
on
the
floor
it
was
known
that
the
slut
deceived
cronshaw
with
the
most
worthless
ragamuffins
of
the
quarter
and
it
was
a
mystery
to
the
ingenuous
youths
who
absorbed
his
wisdom
over
a
cafe
table
that
cronshaw
with
his
keen
intellect
and
his
passion
for
beauty
could
ally
himself
to
such
a
creature
but
he
seemed
to
revel
in
the
coarseness
of
her
language
and
would
often
report
some
phrase
which
reeked
of
the
gutter
he
referred
to
her
ironically
as
la
fille
de
mon
concierge
cronshaw
was
very
poor
he
earned
a
bare
subsistence
by
writing
on
the
exhibitions
of
pictures
for
one
or
two
english
papers
and
he
did
a
certain
amount
of
translating
he
had
been
on
the
staff
of
an
english
paper
in
paris
but
had
been
dismissed
for
drunkenness
he
still
however
did
odd
jobs
for
it
describing
sales
at
the
hotel
drouot
or
the
revues
at
musichalls
the
life
of
paris
had
got
into
his
bones
and
he
would
not
change
it
notwithstanding
its
squalor
drudgery
and
hardship
for
any
other
in
the
world
he
remained
there
all
through
the
year
even
in
summer
when
everyone
he
knew
was
away
and
felt
himself
only
at
ease
within
a
mile
of
the
boulevard
st
michel
but
the
curious
thing
was
that
he
had
never
learnt
to
speak
french
passably
and
he
kept
in
his
shabby
clothes
bought
at
la
belle
jardiniere
an
ineradicably
english
appearance
he
was
a
man
who
would
have
made
a
success
of
life
a
century
and
a
half
ago
when
conversation
was
a
passport
to
good
company
and
inebriety
no
bar
i
ought
to
have
lived
in
the
eighteen
hundreds
he
said
himself
what
i
want
is
a
patron
i
should
have
published
my
poems
by
subscription
and
dedicated
them
to
a
nobleman
i
long
to
compose
rhymed
couplets
upon
the
poodle
of
a
countess
my
soul
yearns
for
the
love
of
chambermaids
and
the
conversation
of
bishops
he
quoted
the
romantic
rolla
je
suis
venu
trop
tard
dans
un
monde
trop
vieux
he
liked
new
faces
and
he
took
a
fancy
to
philip
who
seemed
to
achieve
the
difficult
feat
of
talking
just
enough
to
suggest
conversation
and
not
too
much
to
prevent
monologue
philip
was
captivated
he
did
not
realise
that
little
that
cronshaw
said
was
new
his
personality
in
conversation
had
a
curious
power
he
had
a
beautiful
and
a
sonorous
voice
and
a
manner
of
putting
things
which
was
irresistible
to
youth
all
he
said
seemed
to
excite
thought
and
often
on
the
way
home
lawson
and
philip
would
walk
to
and
from
one
anothers
hotels
discussing
some
point
which
a
chance
word
of
cronshaw
had
suggested
it
was
disconcerting
to
philip
who
had
a
youthful
eagerness
for
results
that
cronshaws
poetry
hardly
came
up
to
expectation
it
had
never
been
published
in
a
volume
but
most
of
it
had
appeared
in
periodicals
and
after
a
good
deal
of
persuasion
cronshaw
brought
down
a
bundle
of
pages
torn
out
of
the
yellow
book
the
saturday
review
and
other
journals
on
each
of
which
was
a
poem
philip
was
taken
aback
to
find
that
most
of
them
reminded
him
either
of
henley
or
of
swinburne
it
needed
the
splendour
of
cronshaws
delivery
to
make
them
personal
he
expressed
his
disappointment
to
lawson
who
carelessly
repeated
his
words
and
next
time
philip
went
to
the
closerie
des
lilas
the
poet
turned
to
him
with
his
sleek
smile
i
hear
you
dont
think
much
of
my
verses
philip
was
embarrassed
i
dont
know
about
that
he
answered
i
enjoyed
reading
them
very
much
do
not
attempt
to
spare
my
feelings
returned
cronshaw
with
a
wave
of
his
fat
hand
i
do
not
attach
any
exaggerated
importance
to
my
poetical
works
life
is
there
to
be
lived
rather
than
to
be
written
about
my
aim
is
to
search
out
the
manifold
experience
that
it
offers
wringing
from
each
moment
what
of
emotion
it
presents
i
look
upon
my
writing
as
a
graceful
accomplishment
which
does
not
absorb
but
rather
adds
pleasure
to
existence
and
as
for
posteritydamn
posterity
philip
smiled
for
it
leaped
to
ones
eyes
that
the
artist
in
life
had
produced
no
more
than
a
wretched
daub
cronshaw
looked
at
him
meditatively
and
filled
his
glass
he
sent
the
waiter
for
a
packet
of
cigarettes
you
are
amused
because
i
talk
in
this
fashion
and
you
know
that
i
am
poor
and
live
in
an
attic
with
a
vulgar
trollop
who
deceives
me
with
hairdressers
and
garcons
de
cafe
i
translate
wretched
books
for
the
british
public
and
write
articles
upon
contemptible
pictures
which
deserve
not
even
to
be
abused
but
pray
tell
me
what
is
the
meaning
of
life
i
say
thats
rather
a
difficult
question
wont
you
give
the
answer
yourself
no
because
its
worthless
unless
you
yourself
discover
it
but
what
do
you
suppose
you
are
in
the
world
for
philip
had
never
asked
himself
and
he
thought
for
a
moment
before
replying
oh
i
dont
know
i
suppose
to
do
ones
duty
and
make
the
best
possible
use
of
ones
faculties
and
avoid
hurting
other
people
in
short
to
do
unto
others
as
you
would
they
should
do
unto
you
i
suppose
so
christianity
no
it
isnt
said
philip
indignantly
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
christianity
its
just
abstract
morality
but
theres
no
such
thing
as
abstract
morality
in
that
case
supposing
under
the
influence
of
liquor
you
left
your
purse
behind
when
you
leave
here
and
i
picked
it
up
why
do
you
imagine
that
i
should
return
it
to
you
its
not
the
fear
of
the
police
its
the
dread
of
hell
if
you
sin
and
the
hope
of
heaven
if
you
are
virtuous
but
i
believe
in
neither
that
may
be
neither
did
kant
when
he
devised
the
categorical
imperative
you
have
thrown
aside
a
creed
but
you
have
preserved
the
ethic
which
was
based
upon
it
to
all
intents
you
are
a
christian
still
and
if
there
is
a
god
in
heaven
you
will
undoubtedly
receive
your
reward
the
almighty
can
hardly
be
such
a
fool
as
the
churches
make
out
if
you
keep
his
laws
i
dont
think
he
can
care
a
packet
of
pins
whether
you
believe
in
him
or
not
but
if
i
left
my
purse
behind
you
would
certainly
return
it
to
me
said
philip
not
from
motives
of
abstract
morality
but
only
from
fear
of
the
police
its
a
thousand
to
one
that
the
police
would
never
find
out
my
ancestors
have
lived
in
a
civilised
state
so
long
that
the
fear
of
the
police
has
eaten
into
my
bones
the
daughter
of
my
concierge
would
not
hesitate
for
a
moment
you
answer
that
she
belongs
to
the
criminal
classes
not
at
all
she
is
merely
devoid
of
vulgar
prejudice
but
then
that
does
away
with
honour
and
virtue
and
goodness
and
decency
and
everything
said
philip
have
you
ever
committed
a
sin
i
dont
know
i
suppose
so
answered
philip
you
speak
with
the
lips
of
a
dissenting
minister
i
have
never
committed
a
sin
cronshaw
in
his
shabby
greatcoat
with
the
collar
turned
up
and
his
hat
well
down
on
his
head
with
his
red
fat
face
and
his
little
gleaming
eyes
looked
extraordinarily
comic
but
philip
was
too
much
in
earnest
to
laugh
have
you
never
done
anything
you
regret
how
can
i
regret
when
what
i
did
was
inevitable
asked
cronshaw
in
return
but
thats
fatalism
the
illusion
which
man
has
that
his
will
is
free
is
so
deeply
rooted
that
i
am
ready
to
accept
it
i
act
as
though
i
were
a
free
agent
but
when
an
action
is
performed
it
is
clear
that
all
the
forces
of
the
universe
from
all
eternity
conspired
to
cause
it
and
nothing
i
could
do
could
have
prevented
it
it
was
inevitable
if
it
was
good
i
can
claim
no
merit
if
it
was
bad
i
can
accept
no
censure
my
brain
reels
said
philip
have
some
whiskey
returned
cronshaw
passing
over
the
bottle
theres
nothing
like
it
for
clearing
the
head
you
must
expect
to
be
thickwitted
if
you
insist
upon
drinking
beer
philip
shook
his
head
and
cronshaw
proceeded
youre
not
a
bad
fellow
but
you
wont
drink
sobriety
disturbs
conversation
but
when
i
speak
of
good
and
bad
philip
saw
he
was
taking
up
the
thread
of
his
discourse
i
speak
conventionally
i
attach
no
meaning
to
those
words
i
refuse
to
make
a
hierarchy
of
human
actions
and
ascribe
worthiness
to
some
and
illrepute
to
others
the
terms
vice
and
virtue
have
no
signification
for
me
i
do
not
confer
praise
or
blame
i
accept
i
am
the
measure
of
all
things
i
am
the
centre
of
the
world
but
there
are
one
or
two
other
people
in
the
world
objected
philip
i
speak
only
for
myself
i
know
them
only
as
they
limit
my
activities
round
each
of
them
too
the
world
turns
and
each
one
for
himself
is
the
centre
of
the
universe
my
right
over
them
extends
only
as
far
as
my
power
what
i
can
do
is
the
only
limit
of
what
i
may
do
because
we
are
gregarious
we
live
in
society
and
society
holds
together
by
means
of
force
force
of
arms
that
is
the
policeman
and
force
of
public
opinion
that
is
mrs
grundy
you
have
society
on
one
hand
and
the
individual
on
the
other
each
is
an
organism
striving
for
selfpreservation
it
is
might
against
might
i
stand
alone
bound
to
accept
society
and
not
unwilling
since
in
return
for
the
taxes
i
pay
it
protects
me
a
weakling
against
the
tyranny
of
another
stronger
than
i
am
but
i
submit
to
its
laws
because
i
must
i
do
not
acknowledge
their
justice
i
do
not
know
justice
i
only
know
power
and
when
i
have
paid
for
the
policeman
who
protects
me
and
if
i
live
in
a
country
where
conscription
is
in
force
served
in
the
army
which
guards
my
house
and
land
from
the
invader
i
am
quits
with
society
for
the
rest
i
counter
its
might
with
my
wiliness
it
makes
laws
for
its
selfpreservation
and
if
i
break
them
it
imprisons
or
kills
me
it
has
the
might
to
do
so
and
therefore
the
right
if
i
break
the
laws
i
will
accept
the
vengeance
of
the
state
but
i
will
not
regard
it
as
punishment
nor
shall
i
feel
myself
convicted
of
wrongdoing
society
tempts
me
to
its
service
by
honours
and
riches
and
the
good
opinion
of
my
fellows
but
i
am
indifferent
to
their
good
opinion
i
despise
honours
and
i
can
do
very
well
without
riches
but
if
everyone
thought
like
you
things
would
go
to
pieces
at
once
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
others
i
am
only
concerned
with
myself
i
take
advantage
of
the
fact
that
the
majority
of
mankind
are
led
by
certain
rewards
to
do
things
which
directly
or
indirectly
tend
to
my
convenience
it
seems
to
me
an
awfully
selfish
way
of
looking
at
things
said
philip
but
are
you
under
the
impression
that
men
ever
do
anything
except
for
selfish
reasons
yes
it
is
impossible
that
they
should
you
will
find
as
you
grow
older
that
the
first
thing
needful
to
make
the
world
a
tolerable
place
to
live
in
is
to
recognise
the
inevitable
selfishness
of
humanity
you
demand
unselfishness
from
others
which
is
a
preposterous
claim
that
they
should
sacrifice
their
desires
to
yours
why
should
they
when
you
are
reconciled
to
the
fact
that
each
is
for
himself
in
the
world
you
will
ask
less
from
your
fellows
they
will
not
disappoint
you
and
you
will
look
upon
them
more
charitably
men
seek
but
one
thing
in
lifetheir
pleasure
no
no
no
cried
philip
cronshaw
chuckled
you
rear
like
a
frightened
colt
because
i
use
a
word
to
which
your
christianity
ascribes
a
deprecatory
meaning
you
have
a
hierarchy
of
values
pleasure
is
at
the
bottom
of
the
ladder
and
you
speak
with
a
little
thrill
of
selfsatisfaction
of
duty
charity
and
truthfulness
you
think
pleasure
is
only
of
the
senses
the
wretched
slaves
who
manufactured
your
morality
despised
a
satisfaction
which
they
had
small
means
of
enjoying
you
would
not
be
so
frightened
if
i
had
spoken
of
happiness
instead
of
pleasure
it
sounds
less
shocking
and
your
mind
wanders
from
the
sty
of
epicurus
to
his
garden
but
i
will
speak
of
pleasure
for
i
see
that
men
aim
at
that
and
i
do
not
know
that
they
aim
at
happiness
it
is
pleasure
that
lurks
in
the
practice
of
every
one
of
your
virtues
man
performs
actions
because
they
are
good
for
him
and
when
they
are
good
for
other
people
as
well
they
are
thought
virtuous
if
he
finds
pleasure
in
giving
alms
he
is
charitable
if
he
finds
pleasure
in
helping
others
he
is
benevolent
if
he
finds
pleasure
in
working
for
society
he
is
publicspirited
but
it
is
for
your
private
pleasure
that
you
give
twopence
to
a
beggar
as
much
as
it
is
for
my
private
pleasure
that
i
drink
another
whiskey
and
soda
i
less
of
a
humbug
than
you
neither
applaud
myself
for
my
pleasure
nor
demand
your
admiration
but
have
you
never
known
people
do
things
they
didnt
want
to
instead
of
things
they
did
no
you
put
your
question
foolishly
what
you
mean
is
that
people
accept
an
immediate
pain
rather
than
an
immediate
pleasure
the
objection
is
as
foolish
as
your
manner
of
putting
it
it
is
clear
that
men
accept
an
immediate
pain
rather
than
an
immediate
pleasure
but
only
because
they
expect
a
greater
pleasure
in
the
future
often
the
pleasure
is
illusory
but
their
error
in
calculation
is
no
refutation
of
the
rule
you
are
puzzled
because
you
cannot
get
over
the
idea
that
pleasures
are
only
of
the
senses
but
child
a
man
who
dies
for
his
country
dies
because
he
likes
it
as
surely
as
a
man
eats
pickled
cabbage
because
he
likes
it
it
is
a
law
of
creation
if
it
were
possible
for
men
to
prefer
pain
to
pleasure
the
human
race
would
have
long
since
become
extinct
but
if
all
that
is
true
cried
philip
what
is
the
use
of
anything
if
you
take
away
duty
and
goodness
and
beauty
why
are
we
brought
into
the
world
here
comes
the
gorgeous
east
to
suggest
an
answer
smiled
cronshaw
he
pointed
to
two
persons
who
at
that
moment
opened
the
door
of
the
cafe
and
with
a
blast
of
cold
air
entered
they
were
levantines
itinerant
vendors
of
cheap
rugs
and
each
bore
on
his
arm
a
bundle
it
was
sunday
evening
and
the
cafe
was
very
full
they
passed
among
the
tables
and
in
that
atmosphere
heavy
and
discoloured
with
tobacco
smoke
rank
with
humanity
they
seemed
to
bring
an
air
of
mystery
they
were
clad
in
european
shabby
clothes
their
thin
greatcoats
were
threadbare
but
each
wore
a
tarbouch
their
faces
were
gray
with
cold
one
was
of
middle
age
with
a
black
beard
but
the
other
was
a
youth
of
eighteen
with
a
face
deeply
scarred
by
smallpox
and
with
one
eye
only
they
passed
by
cronshaw
and
philip
allah
is
great
and
mahomet
is
his
prophet
said
cronshaw
impressively
the
elder
advanced
with
a
cringing
smile
like
a
mongrel
used
to
blows
with
a
sidelong
glance
at
the
door
and
a
quick
surreptitious
movement
he
showed
a
pornographic
picture
are
you
masreddeen

merchant
of
alexandria
or
is
it
from
far
bagdad
that
you
bring
your

i
see
in
him
one
of
the
three
kings
of
whom
scheherazade
told
stories
to
her
lord
the
pedlars
smile
grew
more
ingratiating
though
he
understood
no
word
of
what
cronshaw
said
and
like
a
conjurer
he
produced
a
sandalwood
box
nay
show
us
the
priceless
web
of
eastern
looms
quoth
cronshaw
for

would
point

levantine
unfolded

said

said
cronshaw
may

the

of

maternal
grandmother
imperturbably
but
smiling
no
more
the
levantine
passed
with
his
wares
to
another
table
cronshaw
turned
to
philip
have
you
ever
been
to
the
cluny
the
museum
there
you
will
see
persian
carpets
of
the
most
exquisite
hue
and
of
a
pattern
the
beautiful
intricacy
of
which
delights
and
amazes
the
eye
in
them
you
will
see
the
mystery
and
the
sensual
beauty
of
the
east
the
roses
of
hafiz
and
the
winecup
of
omar
but
presently
you
will
see
more
you
were
asking
just
now
what
was
the
meaning
of
life
go
and
look
at
those
persian
carpets
and
one
of
these
days
the
answer
will
come
to
you
you
are
cryptic
said
philip
i
am
drunk
answered
cronshaw
chapter
xlvi
philip
did
not
find
living
in
paris
as
cheap
as
he
had
been
led
to
believe
and
by
february
had
spent
most
of
the
money
with
which
he
started
he
was
too
proud
to
appeal
to
his
guardian
nor
did
he
wish
aunt
louisa
to
know
that
his
circumstances
were
straitened
since
he
was
certain
she
would
make
an
effort
to
send
him
something
from
her
own
pocket
and
he
knew
how
little
she
could
afford
to
in
three
months
he
would
attain
his
majority
and
come
into
possession
of
his
small
fortune
he
tided
over
the
interval
by
selling
the
few
trinkets
which
he
had
inherited
from
his
father
at
about
this
time
lawson
suggested
that
they
should
take
a
small
studio
which
was
vacant
in
one
of
the
streets
that
led
out
of
the
boulevard
raspail
it
was
very
cheap
it
had
a
room
attached
which
they
could
use
as
a
bedroom
and
since
philip
was
at
the
school
every
morning
lawson
could
have
the
undisturbed
use
of
the
studio
then
lawson
after
wandering
from
school
to
school
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
he
could
work
best
alone
and
proposed
to
get
a
model
in
three
or
four
days
a
week
at
first
philip
hesitated
on
account
of
the
expense
but
they
reckoned
it
out
and
it
seemed
they
were
so
anxious
to
have
a
studio
of
their
own
that
they
calculated
pragmatically
that
the
cost
would
not
be
much
greater
than
that
of
living
in
a
hotel
though
the
rent
and
the
cleaning
by
the
concierge
would
come
to
a
little
more
they
would
save
on
the
petit
dejeuner
which
they
could
make
themselves
a
year
or
two
earlier
philip
would
have
refused
to
share
a
room
with
anyone
since
he
was
so
sensitive
about
his
deformed
foot
but
his
morbid
way
of
looking
at
it
was
growing
less
marked
in
paris
it
did
not
seem
to
matter
so
much
and
though
he
never
by
any
chance
forgot
it
himself
he
ceased
to
feel
that
other
people
were
constantly
noticing
it
they
moved
in
bought
a
couple
of
beds
a
washingstand
a
few
chairs
and
felt
for
the
first
time
the
thrill
of
possession
they
were
so
excited
that
the
first
night
they
went
to
bed
in
what
they
could
call
a
home
they
lay
awake
talking
till
three
in
the
morning
and
next
day
found
lighting
the
fire
and
making
their
own
coffee
which
they
had
in
pyjamas
such
a
jolly
business
that
philip
did
not
get
to
amitranos
till
nearly
eleven
he
was
in
excellent
spirits
he
nodded
to
fanny
price
how
are
you
getting
on
he
asked
cheerily
what
does
that
matter
to
you
she
asked
in
reply
philip
could
not
help
laughing
dont
jump
down
my
throat
i
was
only
trying
to
make
myself
polite
i
dont
want
your
politeness
dyou
think
its
worth
while
quarrelling
with
me
too
asked
philip
mildly
there
are
so
few
people
youre
on
speaking
terms
with
as
it
is
thats
my
business
isnt
it
quite
he
began
to
work
vaguely
wondering
why
fanny
price
made
herself
so
disagreeable
he
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
he
thoroughly
disliked
her
everyone
did
people
were
only
civil
to
her
at
all
from
fear
of
the
malice
of
her
tongue
for
to
their
faces
and
behind
their
backs
she
said
abominable
things
but
philip
was
feeling
so
happy
that
he
did
not
want
even
miss
price
to
bear
illfeeling
towards
him
he
used
the
artifice
which
had
often
before
succeeded
in
banishing
her
illhumour
i
say
i
wish
youd
come
and
look
at
my
drawing
ive
got
in
an
awful
mess
thank
you
very
much
but
ive
got
something
better
to
do
with
my
time
philip
stared
at
her
in
surprise
for
the
one
thing
she
could
be
counted
upon
to
do
with
alacrity
was
to
give
advice
she
went
on
quickly
in
a
low
voice
savage
with
fury
now
that
lawsons
gone
you
think
youll
put
up
with
me
thank
you
very
much
go
and
find
somebody
else
to
help
you
i
dont
want
anybody
elses
leavings
lawson
had
the
pedagogic
instinct
whenever
he
found
anything
out
he
was
eager
to
impart
it
and
because
he
taught
with
delight
he
talked
with
profit
philip
without
thinking
anything
about
it
had
got
into
the
habit
of
sitting
by
his
side
it
never
occurred
to
him
that
fanny
price
was
consumed
with
jealousy
and
watched
his
acceptance
of
someone
elses
tuition
with
everincreasing
anger
you
were
very
glad
to
put
up
with
me
when
you
knew
nobody
here
she
said
bitterly
and
as
soon
as
you
made
friends
with
other
people
you
threw
me
aside
like
an
old
gloveshe
repeated
the
stale
metaphor
with
satisfactionlike
an
old
glove
all
right
i
dont
care
but
im
not
going
to
be
made
a
fool
of
another
time
there
was
a
suspicion
of
truth
in
what
she
said
and
it
made
philip
angry
enough
to
answer
what
first
came
into
his
head
hang
it
all
i
only
asked
your
advice
because
i
saw
it
pleased
you
she
gave
a
gasp
and
threw
him
a
sudden
look
of
anguish
then
two
tears
rolled
down
her
cheeks
she
looked
frowsy
and
grotesque
philip
not
knowing
what
on
earth
this
new
attitude
implied
went
back
to
his
work
he
was
uneasy
and
consciencestricken
but
he
would
not
go
to
her
and
say
he
was
sorry
if
he
had
caused
her
pain
because
he
was
afraid
she
would
take
the
opportunity
to
snub
him
for
two
or
three
weeks
she
did
not
speak
to
him
and
after
philip
had
got
over
the
discomfort
of
being
cut
by
her
he
was
somewhat
relieved
to
be
free
from
so
difficult
a
friendship
he
had
been
a
little
disconcerted
by
the
air
of
proprietorship
she
assumed
over
him
she
was
an
extraordinary
woman
she
came
every
day
to
the
studio
at
eight
oclock
and
was
ready
to
start
working
when
the
model
was
in
position
she
worked
steadily
talking
to
no
one
struggling
hour
after
hour
with
difficulties
she
could
not
overcome
and
remained
till
the
clock
struck
twelve
her
work
was
hopeless
there
was
not
in
it
the
smallest
approach
even
to
the
mediocre
achievement
at
which
most
of
the
young
persons
were
able
after
some
months
to
arrive
she
wore
every
day
the
same
ugly
brown
dress
with
the
mud
of
the
last
wet
day
still
caked
on
the
hem
and
with
the
raggedness
which
philip
had
noticed
the
first
time
he
saw
her
still
unmended
but
one
day
she
came
up
to
him
and
with
a
scarlet
face
asked
whether
she
might
speak
to
him
afterwards
of
course
as
much
as
you
like
smiled
philip
ill
wait
behind
at
twelve
he
went
to
her
when
the
days
work
was
over
will
you
walk
a
little
bit
with
me
she
said
looking
away
from
him
with
embarrassment
certainly
they
walked
for
two
or
three
minutes
in
silence
dyou
remember
what
you
said
to
me
the
other
day
she
asked
then
on
a
sudden
oh
i
say
dont
lets
quarrel
said
philip
it
really
isnt
worth
while
she
gave
a
quick
painful
inspiration
i
dont
want
to
quarrel
with
you
youre
the
only
friend
i
had
in
paris
i
thought
you
rather
liked
me
i
felt
there
was
something
between
us
i
was
drawn
towards
youyou
know
what
i
mean
your
clubfoot
philip
reddened
and
instinctively
tried
to
walk
without
a
limp
he
did
not
like
anyone
to
mention
the
deformity
he
knew
what
fanny
price
meant
she
was
ugly
and
uncouth
and
because
he
was
deformed
there
was
between
them
a
certain
sympathy
he
was
very
angry
with
her
but
he
forced
himself
not
to
speak
you
said
you
only
asked
my
advice
to
please
me
dont
you
think
my
works
any
good
ive
only
seen
your
drawing
at
amitranos
its
awfully
hard
to
judge
from
that
i
was
wondering
if
youd
come
and
look
at
my
other
work
ive
never
asked
anyone
else
to
look
at
it
i
should
like
to
show
it
to
you
its
awfully
kind
of
you
id
like
to
see
it
very
much
i
live
quite
near
here
she
said
apologetically
itll
only
take
you
ten
minutes
oh
thats
all
right
he
said
they
were
walking
along
the
boulevard
and
she
turned
down
a
side
street
then
led
him
into
another
poorer
still
with
cheap
shops
on
the
ground
floor
and
at
last
stopped
they
climbed
flight
after
flight
of
stairs
she
unlocked
a
door
and
they
went
into
a
tiny
attic
with
a
sloping
roof
and
a
small
window
this
was
closed
and
the
room
had
a
musty
smell
though
it
was
very
cold
there
was
no
fire
and
no
sign
that
there
had
been
one
the
bed
was
unmade
a
chair
a
chest
of
drawers
which
served
also
as
a
washstand
and
a
cheap
easel
were
all
the
furniture
the
place
would
have
been
squalid
enough
in
any
case
but
the
litter
the
untidiness
made
the
impression
revolting
on
the
chimneypiece
scattered
over
with
paints
and
brushes
were
a
cup
a
dirty
plate
and
a
teapot
if
youll
stand
over
there
ill
put
them
on
the
chair
so
that
you
can
see
them
better
she
showed
him
twenty
small
canvases
about
eighteen
by
twelve
she
placed
them
on
the
chair
one
after
the
other
watching
his
face
he
nodded
as
he
looked
at
each
one
you
do
like
them
dont
you
she
said
anxiously
after
a
bit
i
just
want
to
look
at
them
all
first
he
answered
ill
talk
afterwards
he
was
collecting
himself
he
was
panicstricken
he
did
not
know
what
to
say
it
was
not
only
that
they
were
illdrawn
or
that
the
colour
was
put
on
amateurishly
by
someone
who
had
no
eye
for
it
but
there
was
no
attempt
at
getting
the
values
and
the
perspective
was
grotesque
it
looked
like
the
work
of
a
child
of
five
but
a
child
would
have
had
some
naivete
and
might
at
least
have
made
an
attempt
to
put
down
what
he
saw
but
here
was
the
work
of
a
vulgar
mind
chock
full
of
recollections
of
vulgar
pictures
philip
remembered
that
she
had
talked
enthusiastically
about
monet
and
the
impressionists
but
here
were
only
the
worst
traditions
of
the
royal
academy
there
she
said
at
last
thats
the
lot
philip
was
no
more
truthful
than
anybody
else
but
he
had
a
great
difficulty
in
telling
a
thundering
deliberate
lie
and
he
blushed
furiously
when
he
answered
i
think
theyre
most
awfully
good
a
faint
colour
came
into
her
unhealthy
cheeks
and
she
smiled
a
little
you
neednt
say
so
if
you
dont
think
so
you
know
i
want
the
truth
but
i
do
think
so
havent
you
got
any
criticism
to
offer
there
must
be
some
you
dont
like
as
well
as
others
philip
looked
round
helplessly
he
saw
a
landscape
the
typical
picturesque
bit
of
the
amateur
an
old
bridge
a
creeperclad
cottage
and
a
leafy
bank
of
course
i
dont
pretend
to
know
anything
about
it
he
said
but
i
wasnt
quite
sure
about
the
values
of
that
she
flushed
darkly
and
taking
up
the
picture
quickly
turned
its
back
to
him
i
dont
know
why
you
should
have
chosen
that
one
to
sneer
at
its
the
best
thing
ive
ever
done
im
sure
my
values
are
all
right
thats
a
thing
you
cant
teach
anyone
you
either
understand
values
or
you
dont
i
think
theyre
all
most
awfully
good
repeated
philip
she
looked
at
them
with
an
air
of
selfsatisfaction
i
dont
think
theyre
anything
to
be
ashamed
of
philip
looked
at
his
watch
i
say
its
getting
late
wont
you
let
me
give
you
a
little
lunch
ive
got
my
lunch
waiting
for
me
here
philip
saw
no
sign
of
it
but
supposed
perhaps
the
concierge
would
bring
it
up
when
he
was
gone
he
was
in
a
hurry
to
get
away
the
mustiness
of
the
room
made
his
head
ache
chapter
xlvii
in
march
there
was
all
the
excitement
of
sending
in
to
the
salon
clutton
characteristically
had
nothing
ready
and
he
was
very
scornful
of
the
two
heads
that
lawson
sent
they
were
obviously
the
work
of
a
student
straightforward
portraits
of
models
but
they
had
a
certain
force
clutton
aiming
at
perfection
had
no
patience
with
efforts
which
betrayed
hesitancy
and
with
a
shrug
of
the
shoulders
told
lawson
it
was
an
impertinence
to
exhibit
stuff
which
should
never
have
been
allowed
out
of
his
studio
he
was
not
less
contemptuous
when
the
two
heads
were
accepted
flanagan
tried
his
luck
too
but
his
picture
was
refused
mrs
otter
sent
a
blameless
portrait
de
ma
mere
accomplished
and
secondrate
and
was
hung
in
a
very
good
place
hayward
whom
philip
had
not
seen
since
he
left
heidelberg
arrived
in
paris
to
spend
a
few
days
in
time
to
come
to
the
party
which
lawson
and
philip
were
giving
in
their
studio
to
celebrate
the
hanging
of
lawsons
pictures
philip
had
been
eager
to
see
hayward
again
but
when
at
last
they
met
he
experienced
some
disappointment
hayward
had
altered
a
little
in
appearance
his
fine
hair
was
thinner
and
with
the
rapid
wilting
of
the
very
fair
he
was
becoming
wizened
and
colourless
his
blue
eyes
were
paler
than
they
had
been
and
there
was
a
muzziness
about
his
features
on
the
other
hand
in
mind
he
did
not
seem
to
have
changed
at
all
and
the
culture
which
had
impressed
philip
at
eighteen
aroused
somewhat
the
contempt
of
philip
at
twentyone
he
had
altered
a
good
deal
himself
and
regarding
with
scorn
all
his
old
opinions
of
art
life
and
letters
had
no
patience
with
anyone
who
still
held
them
he
was
scarcely
conscious
of
the
fact
that
he
wanted
to
show
off
before
hayward
but
when
he
took
him
round
the
galleries
he
poured
out
to
him
all
the
revolutionary
opinions
which
himself
had
so
recently
adopted
he
took
him
to
manets
olympia
and
said
dramatically
i
would
give
all
the
old
masters
except
velasqued
rembrandt
and
vermeer
for
that
one
picture
who
was
vermeer
asked
hayward
oh
my
dear
fellow
dont
you
know
vermeer
youre
not
civilised
you
mustnt
live
a
moment
longer
without
making
his
acquaintance
hes
the
one
old
master
who
painted
like
a
modern
he
dragged
hayward
out
of
the
luxembourg
and
hurried
him
off
to
the
louvre
but
arent
there
any
more
pictures
here
asked
hayward
with
the
tourists
passion
for
thoroughness
nothing
of
the
least
consequence
you
can
come
and
look
at
them
by
yourself
with
your
baedeker
when
they
arrived
at
the
louvre
philip
led
his
friend
down
the
long
gallery
i
should
like
to
see
the
gioconda
said
hayward
oh
my
dear
fellow
its
only
literature
answered
philip
at
last
in
a
small
room
philip
stopped
before
the
lacemaker
of
vermeer
van
delft
there
thats
the
best
picture
in
the
louvre
its
exactly
like
a
manet
with
an
expressive
eloquent
thumb
philip
expatiated
on
the
charming
work
he
used
the
jargon
of
the
studios
with
overpowering
effect
i
dont
know
that
i
see
anything
so
wonderful
as
all
that
in
it
said
hayward
of
course
its
a
painters
picture
said
philip
i
can
quite
believe
the
layman
would
see
nothing
much
in
it
the
what
said
hayward
the
layman
like
most
people
who
cultivate
an
interest
in
the
arts
hayward
was
extremely
anxious
to
be
right
he
was
dogmatic
with
those
who
did
not
venture
to
assert
themselves
but
with
the
selfassertive
he
was
very
modest
he
was
impressed
by
philips
assurance
and
accepted
meekly
philips
implied
suggestion
that
the
painters
arrogant
claim
to
be
the
sole
possible
judge
of
painting
has
anything
but
its
impertinence
to
recommend
it
a
day
or
two
later
philip
and
lawson
gave
their
party
cronshaw
making
an
exception
in
their
favour
agreed
to
eat
their
food
and
miss
chalice
offered
to
come
and
cook
for
them
she
took
no
interest
in
her
own
sex
and
declined
the
suggestion
that
other
girls
should
be
asked
for
her
sake
clutton
flanagan
potter
and
two
others
made
up
the
party
furniture
was
scarce
so
the
model
stand
was
used
as
a
table
and
the
guests
were
to
sit
on
portmanteaux
if
they
liked
and
if
they
didnt
on
the
floor
the
feast
consisted
of
a
potaufeu
which
miss
chalice
had
made
of
a
leg
of
mutton
roasted
round
the
corner
and
brought
round
hot
and
savoury
miss
chalice
had
cooked
the
potatoes
and
the
studio
was
redolent
of
the
carrots
she
had
fried
fried
carrots
were
her
specialty
and
this
was
to
be
followed
by
poires
flambees
pears
with
burning
brandy
which
cronshaw
had
volunteered
to
make
the
meal
was
to
finish
with
an
enormous
fromage
de
brie
which
stood
near
the
window
and
added
fragrant
odours
to
all
the
others
which
filled
the
studio
cronshaw
sat
in
the
place
of
honour
on
a
gladstone
bag
with
his
legs
curled
under
him
like
a
turkish
bashaw
beaming
goodnaturedly
on
the
young
people
who
surrounded
him
from
force
of
habit
though
the
small
studio
with
the
stove
lit
was
very
hot
he
kept
on
his
greatcoat
with
the
collar
turned
up
and
his
bowler
hat
he
looked
with
satisfaction
on
the
four
large
fiaschi
of
chianti
which
stood
in
front
of
him
in
a
row
two
on
each
side
of
a
bottle
of
whiskey
he
said
it
reminded
him
of
a
slim
fair
circassian
guarded
by
four
corpulent
eunuchs
hayward
in
order
to
put
the
rest
of
them
at
their
ease
had
clothed
himself
in
a
tweed
suit
and
a
trinity
hall
tie
he
looked
grotesquely
british
the
others
were
elaborately
polite
to
him
and
during
the
soup
they
talked
of
the
weather
and
the
political
situation
there
was
a
pause
while
they
waited
for
the
leg
of
mutton
and
miss
chalice
lit
a
cigarette
rapunzel
rapunzel
let
down
your
hair
she
said
suddenly
with
an
elegant
gesture
she
untied
a
ribbon
so
that
her
tresses
fell
over
her
shoulders
she
shook
her
head
i
always
feel
more
comfortable
with
my
hair
down
with
her
large
brown
eyes
thin
ascetic
face
her
pale
skin
and
broad
forehead
she
might
have
stepped
out
of
a
picture
by
burnejones
she
had
long
beautiful
hands
with
fingers
deeply
stained
by
nicotine
she
wore
sweeping
draperies
mauve
and
green
there
was
about
her
the
romantic
air
of
high
street
kensington
she
was
wantonly
aesthetic
but
she
was
an
excellent
creature
kind
and
good
natured
and
her
affectations
were
but
skindeep
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
and
they
all
gave
a
shout
of
exultation
miss
chalice
rose
and
opened
she
took
the
leg
of
mutton
and
held
it
high
above
her
as
though
it
were
the
head
of
john
the
baptist
on
a
platter
and
the
cigarette
still
in
her
mouth
advanced
with
solemn
hieratic
steps
hail
daughter
of
herodias
cried
cronshaw
the
mutton
was
eaten
with
gusto
and
it
did
one
good
to
see
what
a
hearty
appetite
the
palefaced
lady
had
clutton
and
potter
sat
on
each
side
of
her
and
everyone
knew
that
neither
had
found
her
unduly
coy
she
grew
tired
of
most
people
in
six
weeks
but
she
knew
exactly
how
to
treat
afterwards
the
gentlemen
who
had
laid
their
young
hearts
at
her
feet
she
bore
them
no
illwill
though
having
loved
them
she
had
ceased
to
do
so
and
treated
them
with
friendliness
but
without
familiarity
now
and
then
she
looked
at
lawson
with
melancholy
eyes
the
poires
flambees
were
a
great
success
partly
because
of
the
brandy
and
partly
because
miss
chalice
insisted
that
they
should
be
eaten
with
the
cheese
i
dont
know
whether
its
perfectly
delicious
or
whether
im
just
going
to
vomit
she
said
after
she
had
thoroughly
tried
the
mixture
coffee
and
cognac
followed
with
sufficient
speed
to
prevent
any
untoward
consequence
and
they
settled
down
to
smoke
in
comfort
ruth
chalice
who
could
do
nothing
that
was
not
deliberately
artistic
arranged
herself
in
a
graceful
attitude
by
cronshaw
and
just
rested
her
exquisite
head
on
his
shoulder
she
looked
into
the
dark
abyss
of
time
with
brooding
eyes
and
now
and
then
with
a
long
meditative
glance
at
lawson
she
sighed
deeply
then
came
the
summer
and
restlessness
seized
these
young
people
the
blue
skies
lured
them
to
the
sea
and
the
pleasant
breeze
sighing
through
the
leaves
of
the
planetrees
on
the
boulevard
drew
them
towards
the
country
everyone
made
plans
for
leaving
paris
they
discussed
what
was
the
most
suitable
size
for
the
canvases
they
meant
to
take
they
laid
in
stores
of
panels
for
sketching
they
argued
about
the
merits
of
various
places
in
brittany
flanagan
and
potter
went
to
concarneau
mrs
otter
and
her
mother
with
a
natural
instinct
for
the
obvious
went
to
pontaven
philip
and
lawson
made
up
their
minds
to
go
to
the
forest
of
fontainebleau
and
miss
chalice
knew
of
a
very
good
hotel
at
moret
where
there
was
lots
of
stuff
to
paint
it
was
near
paris
and
neither
philip
nor
lawson
was
indifferent
to
the
railway
fare
ruth
chalice
would
be
there
and
lawson
had
an
idea
for
a
portrait
of
her
in
the
open
air
just
then
the
salon
was
full
of
portraits
of
people
in
gardens
in
sunlight
with
blinking
eyes
and
green
reflections
of
sunlit
leaves
on
their
faces
they
asked
clutton
to
go
with
them
but
he
preferred
spending
the
summer
by
himself
he
had
just
discovered
cezanne
and
was
uger
to
go
to
provence
he
wanted
heavy
skies
from
which
the
hot
blue
seemed
to
drip
like
beads
of
sweat
and
broad
white
dusty
roads
and
pale
roofs
out
of
which
the
sun
had
burnt
the
colour
and
olive
trees
gray
with
heat
the
day
before
they
were
to
start
after
the
morning
class
philip
putting
his
things
together
spoke
to
fanny
price
im
off
tomorrow
he
said
cheerfully
off
where
she
said
quickly
youre
not
going
away
her
face
fell
im
going
away
for
the
summer
arent
you
no
im
staying
in
paris
i
thought
you
were
going
to
stay
too
i
was
looking
forward
she
stopped
and
shrugged
her
shoulders
but
wont
it
be
frightfully
hot
here
its
awfully
bad
for
you
much
you
care
if
its
bad
for
me
where
are
you
going
moret
chalice
is
going
there
youre
not
going
with
her
lawson
and
i
are
going
and
shes
going
there
too
i
dont
know
that
were
actually
going
together
she
gave
a
low
guttural
sound
and
her
large
face
grew
dark
and
red
how
filthy
i
thought
you
were
a
decent
fellow
you
were
about
the
only
one
here
shes
been
with
clutton
and
potter
and
flanagan
even
with
old
foinetthats
why
he
takes
so
much
trouble
about
herand
now
two
of
you
you
and
lawson
it
makes
me
sick
oh
what
nonsense
shes
a
very
decent
sort
one
treats
her
just
as
if
she
were
a
man
oh
dont
speak
to
me
dont
speak
to
me
but
what
can
it
matter
to
you
asked
philip
its
really
no
business
of
yours
where
i
spend
my
summer
i
was
looking
forward
to
it
so
much
she
gasped
speaking
it
seemed
almost
to
herself
i
didnt
think
you
had
the
money
to
go
away
and
there
wouldnt
have
been
anyone
else
here
and
we
could
have
worked
together
and
wed
have
gone
to
see
things
then
her
thoughts
flung
back
to
ruth
chalice
the
filthy
beast
she
cried
she
isnt
fit
to
speak
to
philip
looked
at
her
with
a
sinking
heart
he
was
not
a
man
to
think
girls
were
in
love
with
him
he
was
too
conscious
of
his
deformity
and
he
felt
awkward
and
clumsy
with
women
but
he
did
not
know
what
else
this
outburst
could
mean
fanny
price
in
the
dirty
brown
dress
with
her
hair
falling
over
her
face
sloppy
untidy
stood
before
him
and
tears
of
anger
rolled
down
her
cheeks
she
was
repellent
philip
glanced
at
the
door
instinctively
hoping
that
someone
would
come
in
and
put
an
end
to
the
scene
im
awfully
sorry
he
said
youre
just
the
same
as
all
of
them
you
take
all
you
can
get
and
you
dont
even
say
thank
you
ive
taught
you
everything
you
know
no
one
else
would
take
any
trouble
with
you
has
foinet

bothered
about
you
and
i
can
tell
you

work
here
for
a
thousand
years
and
youll
never
do
any
good

got
any
talent
you
havent
got
any
originality
and
its
not
only
methey
all
say
it
youll
never
be
a
painter
as
long
as
you
live
that
is
no
business
of
yours
either
is
it
said
philip
flushing
oh

think
its
only
my
temper
ask
clutton
ask
lawson
ask
chalice
never
never
never
you
havent
got
it
in
you
philip
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
walked
out
she
shouted
after
him
never
never
never
moret
was
in
those
days
an
oldfashioned
town
of
one
street
at
the
edge
of
the
forest
of
fontainebleau
and
the
ecu
dor
was
a
hotel
which
still
had
about
it
the
decrepit
air
of
the
ancien
regime
it
faced
the
winding
river
the
loing
and
miss
chalice
had
a
room
with
a
little
terrace
overlooking
it
with
a
charming
view
of
the
old
bridge
and
its
fortified
gateway
they
sat
here
in
the
evenings
after
dinner
drinking
coffee
smoking
and
discussing
art
there
ran
into
the
river
a
little
way
off
a
narrow
canal
bordered
by
poplars
and
along
the
banks
of
this
after
their
days
work
they
often
wandered
they
spent
all
day
painting
like
most
of
their
generation
they
were
obsessed
by
the
fear
of
the
picturesque
and
they
turned
their
backs
on
the
obvious
beauty
of
the
town
to
seek
subjects
which
were
devoid
of
a
prettiness
they
despised
sisley
and
monet
had
painted
the
canal
with
its
poplars
and
they
felt
a
desire
to
try
their
hands
at
what
was
so
typical
of
france
but
they
were
frightened
of
its
formal
beauty
and
set
themselves
deliberately
to
avoid
it
miss
chalice
who
had
a
clever
dexterity
which
impressed
lawson
notwithstanding
his
contempt
for
feminine
art
started
a
picture
in
which
she
tried
to
circumvent
the
commonplace
by
leaving
out
the
tops
of
the
trees
and
lawson
had
the
brilliant
idea
of
putting
in
his
foreground
a
large
blue
advertisement
of
chocolat
menier
in
order
to
emphasise
his
abhorrence
of
the
chocolate
box
philip
began
now
to
paint
in
oils
he
experienced
a
thrill
of
delight
when
first
he
used
that
grateful
medium
he
went
out
with
lawson
in
the
morning
with
his
little
box
and
sat
by
him
painting
a
panel
it
gave
him
so
much
satisfaction
that
he
did
not
realise
he
was
doing
no
more
than
copy
he
was
so
much
under
his
friends
influence
that
he
saw
only
with
his
eyes
lawson
painted
very
low
in
tone
and
they
both
saw
the
emerald
of
the
grass
like
dark
velvet
while
the
brilliance
of
the
sky
turned
in
their
hands
to
a
brooding
ultramarine
through
july
they
had
one
fine
day
after
another
it
was
very
hot
and
the
heat
searing
philips
heart
filled
him
with
languor
he
could
not
work
his
mind
was
eager
with
a
thousand
thoughts
often
he
spent
the
mornings
by
the
side
of
the
canal
in
the
shade
of
the
poplars
reading
a
few
lines
and
then
dreaming
for
half
an
hour
sometimes
he
hired
a
rickety
bicycle
and
rode
along
the
dusty
road
that
led
to
the
forest
and
then
lay
down
in
a
clearing
his
head
was
full
of
romantic
fancies
the
ladies
of
watteau
gay
and
insouciant
seemed
to
wander
with
their
cavaliers
among
the
great
trees
whispering
to
one
another
careless
charming
things
and
yet
somehow
oppressed
by
a
nameless
fear
they
were
alone
in
the
hotel
but
for
a
fat
frenchwoman
of
middle
age
a
rabelaisian
figure
with
a
broad
obscene
laugh
she
spent
the
day
by
the
river
patiently
fishing
for
fish
she
never
caught
and
philip
sometimes
went
down
and
talked
to
her
he
found
out
that
she
had
belonged
to
a
profession
whose
most
notorious
member
for
our
generation
was
mrs
warren
and
having
made
a
competence
she
now
lived
the
quiet
life
of
the
bourgeoise
she
told
philip
lewd
stories
you
must
go
to
seville
she
saidshe
spoke
a
little
broken
english
the
most
beautiful
women
in
the
world
she
leered
and
nodded
her
head
her
triple
chin
her
large
belly
shook
with
inward
laughter
it
grew
so
hot
that
it
was
almost
impossible
to
sleep
at
night
the
heat
seemed
to
linger
under
the
trees
as
though
it
were
a
material
thing
they
did
not
wish
to
leave
the
starlit
night
and
the
three
of
them
would
sit
on
the
terrace
of
ruth
chalices
room
silent
hour
after
hour
too
tired
to
talk
any
more
but
in
voluptuous
enjoyment
of
the
stillness
they
listened
to
the
murmur
of
the
river
the
church
clock
struck
one
and
two
and
sometimes
three
before
they
could
drag
themselves
to
bed
suddenly
philip
became
aware
that
ruth
chalice
and
lawson
were
lovers
he
divined
it
in
the
way
the
girl
looked
at
the
young
painter
and
in
his
air
of
possession
and
as
philip
sat
with
them
he
felt
a
kind
of
effluence
surrounding
them
as
though
the
air
were
heavy
with
something
strange
the
revelation
was
a
shock
he
had
looked
upon
miss
chalice
as
a
very
good
fellow
and
he
liked
to
talk
to
her
but
it
had
never
seemed
to
him
possible
to
enter
into
a
closer
relationship
one
sunday
they
had
all
gone
with
a
teabasket
into
the
forest
and
when
they
came
to
a
glade
which
was
suitably
sylvan
miss
chalice
because
it
was
idyllic
insisted
on
taking
off
her
shoes
and
stockings
it
would
have
been
very
charming
only
her
feet
were
rather
large
and
she
had
on
both
a
large
corn
on
the
third
toe
philip
felt
it
made
her
proceeding
a
little
ridiculous
but
now
he
looked
upon
her
quite
differently
there
was
something
softly
feminine
in
her
large
eyes
and
her
olive
skin
he
felt
himself
a
fool
not
to
have
seen
that
she
was
attractive
he
thought
he
detected
in
her
a
touch
of
contempt
for
him
because
he
had
not
had
the
sense
to
see
that
she
was
there
in
his
way
and
in
lawson
a
suspicion
of
superiority
he
was
envious
of
lawson
and
he
was
jealous
not
of
the
individual
concerned
but
of
his
love
he
wished
that
he
was
standing
in
his
shoes
and
feeling
with
his
heart
he
was
troubled
and
the
fear
seized
him
that
love
would
pass
him
by
he
wanted
a
passion
to
seize
him
he
wanted
to
be
swept
off
his
feet
and
borne
powerless
in
a
mighty
rush
he
cared
not
whither
miss
chalice
and
lawson
seemed
to
him
now
somehow
different
and
the
constant
companionship
with
them
made
him
restless
he
was
dissatisfied
with
himself
life
was
not
giving
him
what
he
wanted
and
he
had
an
uneasy
feeling
that
he
was
losing
his
time
the
stout
frenchwoman
soon
guessed
what
the
relations
were
between
the
couple
and
talked
of
the
matter
to
philip
with
the
utmost
frankness
and
you
she
said
with
the
tolerant
smile
of
one
who
had
fattened
on
the
lust
of
her
fellows
have
you
got
a
petite
amie
no
said
philip
blushing
and
why
not
cest
de
votre
age
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
he
had
a
volume
of
verlaine
in
his
hands
and
he
wandered
off
he
tried
to
read
but
his
passion
was
too
strong
he
thought
of
the
stray
amours
to
which
he
had
been
introduced
by
flanagan
the
sly
visits
to
houses
in
a
culdesac
with
the
drawingroom
in
utrecht
velvet
and
the
mercenary
graces
of
painted
women
he
shuddered
he
threw
himself
on
the
grass
stretching
his
limbs
like
a
young
animal
freshly
awaked
from
sleep
and
the
rippling
water
the
poplars
gently
tremulous
in
the
faint
breeze
the
blue
sky
were
almost
more
than
he
could
bear
he
was
in
love
with
love
in
his
fancy
he
felt
the
kiss
of
warm
lips
on
his
and
around
his
neck
the
touch
of
soft
hands
he
imagined
himself
in
the
arms
of
ruth
chalice
he
thought
of
her
dark
eyes
and
the
wonderful
texture
of
her
skin
he
was
mad
to
have
let
such
a
wonderful
adventure
slip
through
his
fingers
and
if
lawson
had
done
it
why
should
not
he
but
this
was
only
when
he
did
not
see
her
when
he
lay
awake
at
night
or
dreamed
idly
by
the
side
of
the
canal
when
he
saw
her
he
felt
suddenly
quite
different
he
had
no
desire
to
take
her
in
his
arms
and
he
could
not
imagine
himself
kissing
her
it
was
very
curious
away
from
her
he
thought
her
beautiful
remembering
only
her
magnificent
eyes
and
the
creamy
pallor
of
her
face
but
when
he
was
with
her
he
saw
only
that
she
was
flatchested
and
that
her
teeth
were
slightly
decayed
he
could
not
forget
the
corns
on
her
toes
he
could
not
understand
himself
would
he
always
love
only
in
absence
and
be
prevented
from
enjoying
anything
when
he
had
the
chance
by
that
deformity
of
vision
which
seemed
to
exaggerate
the
revolting
he
was
not
sorry
when
a
change
in
the
weather
announcing
the
definite
end
of
the
long
summer
drove
them
all
back
to
paris
chapter
xlviii
when
philip
returned
to
amitranos
he
found
that
fanny
price
was
no
longer
working
there
she
had
given
up
the
key
of
her
locker
he
asked
mrs
otter
whether
she
knew
what
had
become
of
her
and
mrs
otter
with
a
shrug
of
the
shoulders
answered
that
she
had
probably
gone
back
to
england
philip
was
relieved
he
was
profoundly
bored
by
her
illtemper
moreover
she
insisted
on
advising
him
about
his
work
looked
upon
it
as
a
slight
when
he
did
not
follow
her
precepts
and
would
not
understand
that
he
felt
himself
no
longer
the
duffer
he
had
been
at
first
soon
he
forgot
all
about
her
he
was
working
in
oils
now
and
he
was
full
of
enthusiasm
he
hoped
to
have
something
done
of
sufficient
importance
to
send
to
the
following
years
salon
lawson
was
painting
a
portrait
of
miss
chalice
she
was
very
paintable
and
all
the
young
men
who
had
fallen
victims
to
her
charm
had
made
portraits
of
her
a
natural
indolence
joined
with
a
passion
for
picturesque
attitude
made
her
an
excellent
sitter
and
she
had
enough
technical
knowledge
to
offer
useful
criticisms
since
her
passion
for
art
was
chiefly
a
passion
to
live
the
life
of
artists
she
was
quite
content
to
neglect
her
own
work
she
liked
the
warmth
of
the
studio
and
the
opportunity
to
smoke
innumerable
cigarettes
and
she
spoke
in
a
low
pleasant
voice
of
the
love
of
art
and
the
art
of
love
she
made
no
clear
distinction
between
the
two
lawson
was
painting
with
infinite
labour
working
till
he
could
hardly
stand
for
days
and
then
scraping
out
all
he
had
done
he
would
have
exhausted
the
patience
of
anyone
but
ruth
chalice
at
last
he
got
into
a
hopeless
muddle
the
only
thing
is
to
take
a
new
canvas
and
start
fresh
he
said
i
know
exactly
what
i
want
now
and
it
wont
take
me
long
philip
was
present
at
the
time
and
miss
chalice
said
to
him
why
dont
you
paint
me
too
youll
be
able
to
learn
a
lot
by
watching
mr
lawson
it
was
one
of
miss
chalices
delicacies
that
she
always
addressed
her
lovers
by
their
surnames
i
should
like
it
awfully
if
lawson
wouldnt
mind
i
dont
care
a
damn
said
lawson
it
was
the
first
time
that
philip
set
about
a
portrait
and
he
began
with
trepidation
but
also
with
pride
he
sat
by
lawson
and
painted
as
he
saw
him
paint
he
profited
by
the
example
and
by
the
advice
which
both
lawson
and
miss
chalice
freely
gave
him
at
last
lawson
finished
and
invited
clutton
in
to
criticise
clutton
had
only
just
come
back
to
paris
from
provence
he
had
drifted
down
to
spain
eager
to
see
velasquez
at
madrid
and
thence
he
had
gone
to
toledo
he
stayed
there
three
months
and
he
was
returned
with
a
name
new
to
the
young
men
he
had
wonderful
things
to
say
of
a
painter
called
el
greco
who
it
appeared
could
only
be
studied
in
toledo
oh
yes
i
know
about
him
said
lawson
hes
the
old
master
whose
distinction
it
is
that
he
painted
as
badly
as
the
moderns
clutton
more
taciturn
than
ever
did
not
answer
but
he
looked
at
lawson
with
a
sardonic
air
are
you
going
to
show
us
the
stuff
youve
brought
back
from
spain
asked
philip
i
didnt
paint
in
spain
i
was
too
busy
what
did
you
do
then
i
thought
things
out
i
believe
im
through
with
the
impressionists
ive
got
an
idea
theyll
seem
very
thin
and
superficial
in
a
few
years
i
want
to
make
a
clean
sweep
of
everything
ive
learnt
and
start
fresh
when
i
came
back
i
destroyed
everything
id
painted
ive
got
nothing
in
my
studio
now
but
an
easel
my
paints
and
some
clean
canvases
what
are
you
going
to
do
i
dont
know
yet
ive
only
got
an
inkling
of
what
i
want
he
spoke
slowly
in
a
curious
manner
as
though
he
were
straining
to
hear
something
which
was
only
just
audible
there
seemed
to
be
a
mysterious
force
in
him
which
he
himself
did
not
understand
but
which
was
struggling
obscurely
to
find
an
outlet
his
strength
impressed
you
lawson
dreaded
the
criticism
he
asked
for
and
had
discounted
the
blame
he
thought
he
might
get
by
affecting
a
contempt
for
any
opinion
of
cluttons
but
philip
knew
there
was
nothing
which
would
give
him
more
pleasure
than
cluttons
praise
clutton
looked
at
the
portrait
for
some
time
in
silence
then
glanced
at
philips
picture
which
was
standing
on
an
easel
whats
that
he
asked
oh
i
had
a
shot
at
a
portrait
too
the
sedulous
ape
he
murmured
he
turned
away
again
to
lawsons
canvas
philip
reddened
but
did
not
speak
well
what
dyou
think
of
it
asked
lawson
at
length
the
modellings
jolly
good
said
clutton
and
i
think
its
very
well
drawn
dyou
think
the
values
are
all
right
quite
lawson
smiled
with
delight
he
shook
himself
in
his
clothes
like
a
wet
dog
i
say
im
jolly
glad
you
like
it
i
dont
i
dont
think
its
of
the
smallest
importance
lawsons
face
fell
and
he
stared
at
clutton
with
astonishment
he
had
no
notion
what
he
meant
clutton
had
no
gift
of
expression
in
words
and
he
spoke
as
though
it
were
an
effort
what
he
had
to
say
was
confused
halting
and
verbose
but
philip
knew
the
words
which
served
as
the
text
of
his
rambling
discourse
clutton
who
never
read
had
heard
them
first
from
cronshaw
and
though
they
had
made
small
impression
they
had
remained
in
his
memory
and
lately
emerging
on
a
sudden
had
acquired
the
character
of
a
revelation
a
good
painter
had
two
chief
objects
to
paint
namely
man
and
the
intention
of
his
soul
the
impressionists
had
been
occupied
with
other
problems
they
had
painted
man
admirably
but
they
had
troubled
themselves
as
little
as
the
english
portrait
painters
of
the
eighteenth
century
with
the
intention
of
his
soul
but
when
you
try
to
get
that
you
become
literary
said
lawson
interrupting
let
me
paint
the
man
like
manet
and
the
intention
of
his
soul
can
go
to
the
devil
that
would
be
all
very
well
if
you
could
beat
manet
at
his
own
game
but
you
cant
get
anywhere
near
him
you
cant
feed
yourself
on
the
day
before
yesterday
its
ground
which
has
been
swept
dry
you
must
go
back
its
when
i
saw
the
grecos
that
i
felt
one
could
get
something
more
out
of
portraits
than
we
knew
before
its
just
going
back
to
ruskin
cried
lawson
noyou
see
he
went
for
morality
i
dont
care
a
damn
for
morality
teaching
doesnt
coome
in
ethics
and
all
that
but
passion
and
emotion
the
greatest
portrait
painters
have
painted
both
man
and
the
intention
of
his
soul
rembrandt
and
el
greco
its
only
the
secondraters
whove
only
painted
man
a
lily
of
the
valley
would
be
lovely
even
if
it
didnt
smell
but
its
more
lovely
because
it
has
perfume
that
picturehe
pointed
to
lawsons
portraitwell
the
drawings
all
right
and
sos
the
modelling
all
right
but
just
conventional
it
ought
to
be
drawn
and
modelled
so
that
you
know
the
girls
a
lousy
slut
correctness
is
all
very
well
el
greco
made
his
people
eight
feet
high
because
he
wanted
to
express
something
he
couldnt
get
any
other
way
damn
el
greco
said
lawson
whats
the
good
of
jawing
about
a
man
when
we
havent
a
chance
of
seeing
any
of
his
work
clutton
shrugged
his
shoulders
smoked
a
cigarette
in
silence
and
went
away
philip
and
lawson
looked
at
one
another
theres
something
in
what
he
says
said
philip
lawson
stared
illtemperedly
at
his
picture
how
the
devil
is
one
to
get
the
intention
of
the
soul
except
by
painting
exactly
what
one
sees
about
this
time
philip
made
a
new
friend
on
monday
morning
models
assembled
at
the
school
in
order
that
one
might
be
chosen
for
the
week
and
one
day
a
young
man
was
taken
who
was
plainly
not
a
model
by
profession
philips
attention
was
attracted
by
the
manner
in
which
he
held
himself
when
he
got
on
to
the
stand
he
stood
firmly
on
both
feet
square
with
clenched
hands
and
with
his
head
defiantly
thrown
forward
the
attitude
emphasised
his
fine
figure
there
was
no
fat
on
him
and
his
muscles
stood
out
as
though
they
were
of
iron
his
head
closecropped
was
wellshaped
and
he
wore
a
short
beard
he
had
large
dark
eyes
and
heavy
eyebrows
he
held
the
pose
hour
after
hour
without
appearance
of
fatigue
there
was
in
his
mien
a
mixture
of
shame
and
of
determination
his
air
of
passionate
energy
excited
philips
romantic
imagination
and
when
the
sitting
ended
he
saw
him
in
his
clothes
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
wore
them
as
though
he
were
a
king
in
rags
he
was
uncommunicative
but
in
a
day
or
two
mrs
otter
told
philip
that
the
model
was
a
spaniard
and
that
he
had
never
sat
before
i
suppose
he
was
starving
said
philip
have
you
noticed
his
clothes
theyre
quite
neat
and
decent
arent
they
it
chanced
that
potter
one
of
the
americans
who
worked
at
amitranos
was
going
to
italy
for
a
couple
of
months
and
offered
his
studio
to
philip
philip
was
pleased
he
was
growing
a
little
impatient
of
lawsons
peremptory
advice
and
wanted
to
be
by
himself
at
the
end
of
the
week
he
went
up
to
the
model
and
on
the
pretence
that
his
drawing
was
not
finished
asked
whether
he
would
come
and
sit
to
him
one
day
im
not
a
model
the
spaniard
answered
i
have
other
things
to
do
next
week
come
and
have
luncheon
with
me
now
and
well
talk
about
it
said
philip
and
as
the
other
hesitated
he
added
with
a
smile
it
wont
hurt
you
to
lunch
with
me
with
a
shrug
of
the
shoulders
the
model
consented
and
they
went
off
to
a
cremerie
the
spaniard
spoke
broken
french
fluent
but
difficult
to
follow
and
philip
managed
to
get
on
well
enough
with
him
he
found
out
that
he
was
a
writer
he
had
come
to
paris
to
write
novels
and
kept
himself
meanwhile
by
all
the
expedients
possible
to
a
penniless
man
he
gave
lessons
he
did
any
translations
he
could
get
hold
of
chiefly
business
documents
and
at
last
had
been
driven
to
make
money
by
his
fine
figure
sitting
was
well
paid
and
what
he
had
earned
during
the
last
week
was
enough
to
keep
him
for
two
more
he
told
philip
amazed
that
he
could
live
easily
on
two
francs
a
day
but
it
filled
him
with
shame
that
he
was
obliged
to
show
his
body
for
money
and
he
looked
upon
sitting
as
a
degradation
which
only
hunger
could
excuse
philip
explained
that
he
did
not
want
him
to
sit
for
the
figure
but
only
for
the
head
he
wished
to
do
a
portrait
of
him
which
he
might
send
to
the
next
salon
but
why
should
you
want
to
paint
me
asked
the
spaniard
philip
answered
that
the
head
interested
him
he
thought
he
could
do
a
good
portrait
i
cant
afford
the
time
i
grudge
every
minute
that
i
have
to
rob
from
my
writing
but
it
would
only
be
in
the
afternoon
i
work
at
the
school
in
the
morning
after
all
its
better
to
sit
to
me
than
to
do
translations
of
legal
documents
there
were
legends
in
the
latin
quarter
of
a
time
when
students
of
different
countries
lived
together
intimately
but
this
was
long
since
passed
and
now
the
various
nations
were
almost
as
much
separated
as
in
an
oriental
city
at
julians
and
at
the
beaux
arts
a
french
student
was
looked
upon
with
disfavour
by
his
fellowcountrymen
when
he
consorted
with
foreigners
and
it
was
difficult
for
an
englishman
to
know
more
than
quite
superficially
any
native
inhabitants
of
the
city
in
which
he
dwelt
indeed
many
of
the
students
after
living
in
paris
for
five
years
knew
no
more
french
than
served
them
in
shops
and
lived
as
english
a
life
as
though
they
were
working
in
south
kensington
philip
with
his
passion
for
the
romantic
welcomed
the
opportunity
to
get
in
touch
with
a
spaniard
he
used
all
his
persuasiveness
to
overcome
the
mans
reluctance
ill
tell
you
what
ill
do
said
the
spaniard
at
last
ill
sit
to
you
but
not
for
money
for
my
own
pleasure
philip
expostulated
but
the
other
was
firm
and
at
length
they
arranged
that
he
should
come
on
the
following
monday
at
one
oclock
he
gave
philip
a
card
on
which
was
printed
his
name
miguel
ajuria
miguel
sat
regularly
and
though
he
refused
to
accept
payment
he
borrowed
fifty
francs
from
philip
every
now
and
then
it
was
a
little
more
expensive
than
if
philip
had
paid
for
the
sittings
in
the
usual
way
but
gave
the
spaniard
a
satisfactory
feeling
that
he
was
not
earning
his
living
in
a
degrading
manner
his
nationality
made
philip
regard
him
as
a
representative
of
romance
and
he
asked
him
about
seville
and
granada
velasquez
and
calderon
but
miguel
bad
no
patience
with
the
grandeur
of
his
country
for
him
as
for
so
many
of
his
compatriots
france
was
the
only
country
for
a
man
of
intelligence
and
paris
the
centre
of
the
world
spain
is
dead
he
cried
it
has
no
writers
it
has
no
art
it
has
nothing
little
by
little
with
the
exuberant
rhetoric
of
his
race
he
revealed
his
ambitions
he
was
writing
a
novel
which
he
hoped
would
make
his
name
he
was
under
the
influence
of
zola
and
he
had
set
his
scene
in
paris
he
told
philip
the
story
at
length
to
philip
it
seemed
crude
and
stupid
the
naive
obscenity
cest
la
vie
mon
cher
cest
la
vie
he
criedthe
naive
obscenity
served
only
to
emphasise
the
conventionality
of
the
anecdote
he
had
written
for
two
years
amid
incredible
hardships
denying
himself
all
the
pleasures
of
life
which
had
attracted
him
to
paris
fighting
with
starvation
for
arts
sake
determined
that
nothing
should
hinder
his
great
achievement
the
effort
was
heroic
but
why
dont
you
write
about
spain
cried
philip
it
would
be
so
much
more
interesting
you
know
the
life
but
paris
is
the
only
place
worth
writing
about
paris
is
life
one
day
he
brought
part
of
the
manuscript
and
in
his
bad
french
translating
excitedly
as
he
went
along
so
that
philip
could
scarcely
understand
he
read
passages
it
was
lamentable
philip
puzzled
looked
at
the
picture
he
was
painting
the
mind
behind
that
broad
brow
was
trivial
and
the
flashing
passionate
eyes
saw
nothing
in
life
but
the
obvious
philip
was
not
satisfied
with
his
portrait
and
at
the
end
of
a
sitting
he
nearly
always
scraped
out
what
he
had
done
it
was
all
very
well
to
aim
at
the
intention
of
the
soul
who
could
tell
what
that
was
when
people
seemed
a
mass
of
contradictions
he
liked
miguel
and
it
distressed
him
to
realise
that
his
magnificent
struggle
was
futile
he
had
everything
to
make
a
good
writer
but
talent
philip
looked
at
his
own
work
how
could
you
tell
whether
there
was
anything
in
it
or
whether
you
were
wasting
your
time
it
was
clear
that
the
will
to
achieve
could
not
help
you
and
confidence
in
yourself
meant
nothing
philip
thought
of
fanny
price
she
had
a
vehement
belief
in
her
talent
her
strength
of
will
was
extraordinary
if
i
thought
i
wasnt
going
to
be
really
good
id
rather
give
up
painting
said
philip
i
dont
see
any
use
in
being
a
secondrate
painter
then
one
morning
when
he
was
going
out
the
concierge
called
out
to
him
that
there
was
a
letter
nobody
wrote
to
him
but
his
aunt
louisa
and
sometimes
hayward
and
this
was
a
handwriting
he
did
not
know
the
letter
was
as
follows
please
come
at
once
when
you
get
this
i
couldnt
put
up
with
it
any
more
please
come
yourself
i
cant
bear
the
thought
that
anyone
else
should
touch
me
i
want
you
to
have
everything
f
price
i
have
not
had
anything
to
eat
for
three
days
philip
felt
on
a
sudden
sick
with
fear
he
hurried
to
the
house
in
which
she
lived
he
was
astonished
that
she
was
in
paris
at
all
he
had
not
seen
her
for
months
and
imagined
she
had
long
since
returned
to
england
when
he
arrived
he
asked
the
concierge
whether
she
was
in
yes
ive
not
seen
her
go
out
for
two
days
philip
ran
upstairs
and
knocked
at
the
door
there
was
no
reply
he
called
her
name
the
door
was
locked
and
on
bending
down
he
found
the
key
was
in
the
lock
oh
my
god
i
hope
she
hasnt
done
something
awful
he
cried
aloud
he
ran
down
and
told
the
porter
that
she
was
certainly
in
the
room
he
had
had
a
letter
from
her
and
feared
a
terrible
accident
he
suggested
breaking
open
the
door
the
porter
who
had
been
sullen
and
disinclined
to
listen
became
alarmed
he
could
not
take
the
responsibility
of
breaking
into
the
room
they
must
go
for
the
commissaire
de
police
they
walked
together
to
the
bureau
and
then
they
fetched
a
locksmith
philip
found
that
miss
price
had
not
paid
the
last
quarters
rent
on
new
years
day
she
had
not
given
the
concierge
the
present
which
oldestablished
custom
led
him
to
regard
as
a
right
the
four
of
them
went
upstairs
and
they
knocked
again
at
the
door
there
was
no
reply
the
locksmith
set
to
work
and
at
last
they
entered
the
room
philip
gave
a
cry
and
instinctively
covered
his
eyes
with
his
hands
the
wretched
woman
was
hanging
with
a
rope
round
her
neck
which
she
had
tied
to
a
hook
in
the
ceiling
fixed
by
some
previous
tenant
to
hold
up
the
curtains
of
the
bed
she
had
moved
her
own
little
bed
out
of
the
way
and
had
stood
on
a
chair
which
had
been
kicked
away
it
was
lying
on
its
side
on
the
floor
they
cut
her
down
the
body
was
quite
cold
chapter
xlix
the
story
which
philip
made
out
in
one
way
and
another
was
terrible
one
of
the
grievances
of
the
womenstudents
was
that
fanny
price
would
never
share
their
gay
meals
in
restaurants
and
the
reason
was
obvious
she
had
been
oppressed
by
dire
poverty
he
remembered
the
luncheon
they
had
eaten
together
when
first
he
came
to
paris
and
the
ghoulish
appetite
which
had
disgusted
him
he
realised
now
that
she
ate
in
that
manner
because
she
was
ravenous
the
concierge
told
him
what
her
food
had
consisted
of
a
bottle
of
milk
was
left
for
her
every
day
and
she
brought
in
her
own
loaf
of
bread
she
ate
half
the
loaf
and
drank
half
the
milk
at
midday
when
she
came
back
from
the
school
and
consumed
the
rest
in
the
evening
it
was
the
same
day
after
day
philip
thought
with
anguish
of
what
she
must
have
endured
she
had
never
given
anyone
to
understand
that
she
was
poorer
than
the
rest
but
it
was
clear
that
her
money
had
been
coming
to
an
end
and
at
last
she
could
not
afford
to
come
any
more
to
the
studio
the
little
room
was
almost
bare
of
furniture
and
there
were
no
other
clothes
than
the
shabby
brown
dress
she
had
always
worn
philip
searched
among
her
things
for
the
address
of
some
friend
with
whom
he
could
communicate
he
found
a
piece
of
paper
on
which
his
own
name
was
written
a
score
of
times
it
gave
him
a
peculiar
shock
he
supposed
it
was
true
that
she
had
loved
him
he
thought
of
the
emaciated
body
in
the
brown
dress
hanging
from
the
nail
in
the
ceiling
and
he
shuddered
but
if
she
had
cared
for
him
why
did
she
not
let
him
help
her
he
would
so
gladly
have
done
all
he
could
he
felt
remorseful
because
he
had
refused
to
see
that
she
looked
upon
him
with
any
particular
feeling
and
now
these
words
in
her
letter
were
infinitely
pathetic
i
cant
bear
the
thought
that
anyone
else
should
touch
me
she
had
died
of
starvation
philip
found
at
length
a
letter
signed
your
loving
brother
albert
it
was
two
or
three
weeks
old
dated
from
some
road
in
surbiton
and
refused
a
loan
of
five
pounds
the
writer
had
his
wife
and
family
to
think
of
he
didnt
feel
justified
in
lending
money
and
his
advice
was
that
fanny
should
come
back
to
london
and
try
to
get
a
situation
philip
telegraphed
to
albert
price
and
in
a
little
while
an
answer
came
deeply
distressed
very
awkward
to
leave
my
business
is
presence
essential
price
philip
wired
a
succinct
affirmative
and
next
morning
a
stranger
presented
himself
at
the
studio
my
names
price
he
said
when
philip
opened
the
door
he
was
a
commonish
man
in
black
with
a
band
round
his
bowler
hat
he
had
something
of
fannys
clumsy
look
he
wore
a
stubbly
moustache
and
had
a
cockney
accent
philip
asked
him
to
come
in
he
cast
sidelong
glances
round
the
studio
while
philip
gave
him
details
of
the
accident
and
told
him
what
he
had
done
i
neednt
see
her
need
i
asked
albert
price
my
nerves
arent
very
strong
and
it
takes
very
little
to
upset
me
he
began
to
talk
freely
he
was
a
rubbermerchant
and
he
had
a
wife
and
three
children
fanny
was
a
governess
and
he
couldnt
make
out
why
she
hadnt
stuck
to
that
instead
of
coming
to
paris
me
and
mrs
price
told
her
paris
was
no
place
for
a
girl
and
theres
no
money
in
artnever
as
been
it
was
plain
enough
that
he
had
not
been
on
friendly
terms
with
his
sister
and
he
resented
her
suicide
as
a
last
injury
that
she
had
done
him
he
did
not
like
the
idea
that
she
had
been
forced
to
it
by
poverty
that
seemed
to
reflect
on
the
family
the
idea
struck
him
that
possibly
there
was
a
more
respectable
reason
for
her
act
i
suppose
she
adnt
any
trouble
with
a
man
ad
she
you
know
what
i
mean
paris
and
all
that
she
might
ave
done
it
so
as
not
to
disgrace
herself
philip
felt
himself
reddening
and
cursed
his
weakness
prices
keen
little
eyes
seemed
to
suspect
him
of
an
intrigue
i
believe
your
sister
to
have
been
perfectly
virtuous
he
answered
acidly
she
killed
herself
because
she
was
starving
well
its
very
ard
on
her
family
mr
carey
she
only
ad
to
write
to
me
i
wouldnt
have
let
my
sister
want
philip
had
found
the
brothers
address
only
by
reading
the
letter
in
which
he
refused
a
loan
but
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
there
was
no
use
in
recrimination
he
hated
the
little
man
and
wanted
to
have
done
with
him
as
soon
as
possible
albert
price
also
wished
to
get
through
the
necessary
business
quickly
so
that
he
could
get
back
to
london
they
went
to
the
tiny
room
in
which
poor
fanny
had
lived
albert
price
looked
at
the
pictures
and
the
furniture
i
dont
pretend
to
know
much
about
art
he
said
i
suppose
these
pictures
would
fetch
something
would
they
nothing
said
philip
the
furnitures
not
worth
ten
shillings
albert
price
knew
no
french
and
philip
had
to
do
everything
it
seemed
that
it
was
an
interminable
process
to
get
the
poor
body
safely
hidden
away
under
ground
papers
had
to
be
obtained
in
one
place
and
signed
in
another
officials
had
to
be
seen
for
three
days
philip
was
occupied
from
morning
till
night
at
last
he
and
albert
price
followed
the
hearse
to
the
cemetery
at
montparnasse
i
want
to
do
the
thing
decent
said
albert
price
but
theres
no
use
wasting
money
the
short
ceremony
was
infinitely
dreadful
in
the
cold
gray
morning
half
a
dozen
people
who
had
worked
with
fanny
price
at
the
studio
came
to
the
funeral
mrs
otter
because
she
was
massiere
and
thought
it
her
duty
ruth
chalice
because
she
had
a
kind
heart
lawson
clutton
and
flanagan
they
had
all
disliked
her
during
her
life
philip
looking
across
the
cemetery
crowded
on
all
sides
with
monuments
some
poor
and
simple
others
vulgar
pretentious
and
ugly
shuddered
it
was
horribly
sordid
when
they
came
out
albert
price
asked
philip
to
lunch
with
him
philip
loathed
him
now
and
he
was
tired
he
had
not
been
sleeping
well
for
he
dreamed
constantly
of
fanny
price
in
the
torn
brown
dress
hanging
from
the
nail
in
the
ceiling
but
he
could
not
think
of
an
excuse
you
take
me
somewhere
where
we
can
get
a
regular
slapup
lunch
all
this
is
the
very
worst
thing
for
my
nerves
lavenues
is
about
the
best
place
round
here
answered
philip
albert
price
settled
himself
on
a
velvet
seat
with
a
sigh
of
relief
he
ordered
a
substantial
luncheon
and
a
bottle
of
wine
well
im
glad
thats
over
he
said
he
threw
out
a
few
artful
questions
and
philip
discovered
that
he
was
eager
to
hear
about
the
painters
life
in
paris
he
represented
it
to
himself
as
deplorable
but
he
was
anxious
for
details
of
the
orgies
which
his
fancy
suggested
to
him
with
sly
winks
and
discrect
sniggering
he
conveyed
that
he
knew
very
well
that
there
was
a
great
deal
more
than
philip
confessed
he
was
a
man
of
the
world
and
he
knew
a
thing
or
two
he
asked
philip
whether
he
had
ever
been
to
any
of
those
places
in
montmartre
which
are
celebrated
from
temple
bar
to
the
royal
exchange
he
would
like
to
say
he
had
been
to
the
moulin
rouge
the
luncheon
was
very
good
and
the
wine
excellent
albert
price
expanded
as
the
processes
of
digestion
went
satisfactorily
forwards
lets
ave
a
little
brandy
he
said
when
the
coffee
was
brought
and
blow
the
expense
he
rubbed
his
hands
you
know
ive
got
alf
a
mind
to
stay
over
tonight
and
go
back
tomorrow
what
dyou
say
to
spending
the
evening
together
if
you
mean
you
want
me
to
take
you
round
montmartre
tonight
ill
see
you
damned
said
philip
i
suppose
it
wouldnt
be
quite
the
thing
the
answer
was
made
so
seriously
that
philip
was
tickled
besides
it
would
be
rotten
for
your
nerves
he
said
gravely
albert
price
concluded
that
he
had
better
go
back
to
london
by
the
four
oclock
train
and
presently
he
took
leave
of
philip
well
goodbye
old
man
he
said
i
tell
you
what
ill
try
and
come
over
to
paris
again
one
of
these
days
and
ill
look
you
up
and
then
we
wont
alf
go
on
the
razzle
philip
was
too
restless
to
work
that
afternoon
so
he
jumped
on
a
bus
and
crossed
the
river
to
see
whether
there
were
any
pictures
on
view
at
durandruels
after
that
he
strolled
along
the
boulevard
it
was
cold
and
windswept
people
hurried
by
wrapped
up
in
their
coats
shrunk
together
in
an
effort
to
keep
out
of
the
cold
and
their
faces
were
pinched
and
careworn
it
was
icy
underground
in
the
cemetery
at
montparnasse
among
all
those
white
tombstones
philip
felt
lonely
in
the
world
and
strangely
homesick
he
wanted
company
at
that
hour
cronshaw
would
be
working
and
clutton
never
welcomed
visitors
lawson
was
painting
another
portrait
of
ruth
chalice
and
would
not
care
to
be
disturbed
he
made
up
his
mind
to
go
and
see
flanagan
he
found
him
painting
but
delighted
to
throw
up
his
work
and
talk
the
studio
was
comfortable
for
the
american
had
more
money
than
most
of
them
and
warm
flanagan
set
about
making
tea
philip
looked
at
the
two
heads
that
he
was
sending
to
the
salon
its
awful
cheek
my
sending
anything
said
flanagan
but
i
dont
care
im
going
to
send
dyou
think
theyre
rotten
not
so
rotten
as
i
should
have
expected
said
philip
they
showed
in
fact
an
astounding
cleverness
the
difficulties
had
been
avoided
with
skill
and
there
was
a
dash
about
the
way
in
which
the
paint
was
put
on
which
was
surprising
and
even
attractive
flanagan
without
knowledge
or
technique
painted
with
the
loose
brush
of
a
man
who
has
spent
a
lifetime
in
the
practice
of
the
art
if
one
were
forbidden
to
look
at
any
picture
for
more
than
thirty
seconds
youd
be
a
great
master
flanagan
smiled
philip
these
young
people
were
not
in
the
habit
of
spoiling
one
another
with
excessive
flattery
we
havent
got
time
in
america
to
spend
more
than
thirty
seconds
in
looking
at
any
picture
laughed
the
other
flanagan
though
he
was
the
most
scatterbrained
person
in
the
world
had
a
tenderness
of
heart
which
was
unexpected
and
charming
whenever
anyone
was
ill
he
installed
himself
as
sicknurse
his
gaiety
was
better
than
any
medicine
like
many
of
his
countrymen
he
had
not
the
english
dread
of
sentimentality
which
keeps
so
tight
a
hold
on
emotion
and
finding
nothing
absurd
in
the
show
of
feeling
could
offer
an
exuberant
sympathy
which
was
often
grateful
to
his
friends
in
distress
he
saw
that
philip
was
depressed
by
what
he
had
gone
through
and
with
unaffected
kindliness
set
himself
boisterously
to
cheer
him
up
he
exaggerated
the
americanisms
which
he
knew
always
made
the
englishmen
laugh
and
poured
out
a
breathless
stream
of
conversation
whimsical
highspirited
and
jolly
in
due
course
they
went
out
to
dinner
and
afterwards
to
the
gaite
montparnasse
which
was
flanagans
favourite
place
of
amusement
by
the
end
of
the
evening
he
was
in
his
most
extravagant
humour
he
had
drunk
a
good
deal
but
any
inebriety
from
which
he
suffered
was
due
much
more
to
his
own
vivacity
than
to
alcohol
he
proposed
that
they
should
go
to
the
bal
bullier
and
philip
feeling
too
tired
to
go
to
bed
willingly
enough
consented
they
sat
down
at
a
table
on
the
platform
at
the
side
raised
a
little
from
the
level
of
the
floor
so
that
they
could
watch
the
dancing
and
drank
a
bock
presently
flanagan
saw
a
friend
and
with
a
wild
shout
leaped
over
the
barrier
on
to
the
space
where
they
were
dancing
philip
watched
the
people
bullier
was
not
the
resort
of
fashion
it
was
thursday
night
and
the
place
was
crowded
there
were
a
number
of
students
of
the
various
faculties
but
most
of
the
men
were
clerks
or
assistants
in
shops
they
wore
their
everyday
clothes
readymade
tweeds
or
queer
tailcoats
and
their
hats
for
they
had
brought
them
in
with
them
and
when
they
danced
there
was
no
place
to
put
them
but
their
heads
some
of
the
women
looked
like
servantgirls
and
some
were
painted
hussies
but
for
the
most
part
they
were
shopgirls
they
were
poorlydressed
in
cheap
imitation
of
the
fashions
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
the
hussies
were
got
up
to
resemble
the
musichall
artiste
or
the
dancer
who
enjoyed
notoriety
at
the
moment
their
eyes
were
heavy
with
black
and
their
cheeks
impudently
scarlet
the
hall
was
lit
by
great
white
lights
low
down
which
emphasised
the
shadows
on
the
faces
all
the
lines
seemed
to
harden
under
it
and
the
colours
were
most
crude
it
was
a
sordid
scene
philip
leaned
over
the
rail
staring
down
and
he
ceased
to
hear
the
music
they
danced
furiously
they
danced
round
the
room
slowly
talking
very
little
with
all
their
attention
given
to
the
dance
the
room
was
hot
and
their
faces
shone
with
sweat
it
seemed
to
philip
that
they
had
thrown
off
the
guard
which
people
wear
on
their
expression
the
homage
to
convention
and
he
saw
them
now
as
they
really
were
in
that
moment
of
abandon
they
were
strangely
animal
some
were
foxy
and
some
were
wolflike
and
others
had
the
long
foolish
face
of
sheep
their
skins
were
sallow
from
the
unhealthy
life
they
led
and
the
poor
food
they
ate
their
features
were
blunted
by
mean
interests
and
their
little
eyes
were
shifty
and
cunning
there
was
nothing
of
nobility
in
their
bearing
and
you
felt
that
for
all
of
them
life
was
a
long
succession
of
petty
concerns
and
sordid
thoughts
the
air
was
heavy
with
the
musty
smell
of
humanity
but
they
danced
furiously
as
though
impelled
by
some
strange
power
within
them
and
it
seemed
to
philip
that
they
were
driven
forward
by
a
rage
for
enjoyment
they
were
seeking
desperately
to
escape
from
a
world
of
horror
the
desire
for
pleasure
which
cronshaw
said
was
the
only
motive
of
human
action
urged
them
blindly
on
and
the
very
vehemence
of
the
desire
seemed
to
rob
it
of
all
pleasure
they
were
hurried
on
by
a
great
wind
helplessly
they
knew
not
why
and
they
knew
not
whither
fate
seemed
to
tower
above
them
and
they
danced
as
though
everlasting
darkness
were
beneath
their
feet
their
silence
was
vaguely
alarming
it
was
as
if
life
terrified
them
and
robbed
them
of
power
of
speech
so
that
the
shriek
which
was
in
their
hearts
died
at
their
throats
their
eyes
were
haggard
and
grim
and
notwithstanding
the
beastly
lust
that
disfigured
them
and
the
meanness
of
their
faces
and
the
cruelty
notwithstanding
the
stupidness
which
was
worst
of
all
the
anguish
of
those
fixed
eyes
made
all
that
crowd
terrible
and
pathetic
philip
loathed
them
and
yet
his
heart
ached
with
the
infinite
pity
which
filled
him
he
took
his
coat
from
the
cloakroom
and
went
out
into
the
bitter
coldness
of
the
night
chapter
l
philip
could
not
get
the
unhappy
event
out
of
his
head
what
troubled
him
most
was
the
uselessness
of
fannys
effort
no
one
could
have
worked
harder
than
she
nor
with
more
sincerity
she
believed
in
herself
with
all
her
heart
but
it
was
plain
that
selfconfidence
meant
very
little
all
his
friends
had
it
miguel
ajuria
among
the
rest
and
philip
was
shocked
by
the
contrast
between
the
spaniards
heroic
endeavour
and
the
triviality
of
the
thing
he
attempted
the
unhappiness
of
philips
life
at
school
had
called
up
in
him
the
power
of
selfanalysis
and
this
vice
as
subtle
as
drugtaking
had
taken
possession
of
him
so
that
he
had
now
a
peculiar
keenness
in
the
dissection
of
his
feelings
he
could
not
help
seeing
that
art
affected
him
differently
from
others
a
fine
picture
gave
lawson
an
immediate
thrill
his
appreciation
was
instinctive
even
flanagan
felt
certain
things
which
philip
was
obliged
to
think
out
his
own
appreciation
was
intellectual
he
could
not
help
thinking
that
if
he
had
in
him
the
artistic
temperament
he
hated
the
phrase
but
could
discover
no
other
he
would
feel
beauty
in
the
emotional
unreasoning
way
in
which
they
did
he
began
to
wonder
whether
he
had
anything
more
than
a
superficial
cleverness
of
the
hand
which
enabled
him
to
copy
objects
with
accuracy
that
was
nothing
he
had
learned
to
despise
technical
dexterity
the
important
thing
was
to
feel
in
terms
of
paint
lawson
painted
in
a
certain
way
because
it
was
his
nature
to
and
through
the
imitativeness
of
a
student
sensitive
to
every
influence
there
pierced
individuality
philip
looked
at
his
own
portrait
of
ruth
chalice
and
now
that
three
months
had
passed
he
realised
that
it
was
no
more
than
a
servile
copy
of
lawson
he
felt
himself
barren
he
painted
with
the
brain
and
he
could
not
help
knowing
that
the
only
painting
worth
anything
was
done
with
the
heart
he
had
very
little
money
barely
sixteen
hundred
pounds
and
it
would
be
necessary
for
him
to
practise
the
severest
economy
he
could
not
count
on
earning
anything
for
ten
years
the
history
of
painting
was
full
of
artists
who
had
earned
nothing
at
all
he
must
resign
himself
to
penury
and
it
was
worth
while
if
he
produced
work
which
was
immortal
but
he
had
a
terrible
fear
that
he
would
never
be
more
than
secondrate
was
it
worth
while
for
that
to
give
up
ones
youth
and
the
gaiety
of
life
and
the
manifold
chances
of
being
he
knew
the
existence
of
foreign
painters
in
paris
enough
to
see
that
the
lives
they
led
were
narrowly
provincial
he
knew
some
who
had
dragged
along
for
twenty
years
in
the
pursuit
of
a
fame
which
always
escaped
them
till
they
sunk
into
sordidness
and
alcoholism
fannys
suicide
had
aroused
memories
and
philip
heard
ghastly
stories
of
the
way
in
which
one
person
or
another
had
escaped
from
despair
he
remembered
the
scornful
advice
which
the
master
had
given
poor
fanny
it
would
have
been
well
for
her
if
she
had
taken
it
and
given
up
an
attempt
which
was
hopeless
philip
finished
his
portrait
of
miguel
ajuria
and
made
up
his
mind
to
send
it
to
the
salon
flanagan
was
sending
two
pictures
and
he
thought
he
could
paint
as
well
as
flanagan
he
had
worked
so
hard
on
the
portrait
that
he
could
not
help
feeling
it
must
have
merit
it
was
true
that
when
he
looked
at
it
he
felt
that
there
was
something
wrong
though
he
could
not
tell
what
but
when
he
was
away
from
it
his
spirits
went
up
and
he
was
not
dissatisfied
he
sent
it
to
the
salon
and
it
was
refused
he
did
not
mind
much
since
he
had
done
all
he
could
to
persuade
himself
that
there
was
little
chance
that
it
would
be
taken
till
flanagan
a
few
days
later
rushed
in
to
tell
lawson
and
philip
that
one
of
his
pictures
was
accepted
with
a
blank
face
philip
offered
his
congratulations
and
flanagan
was
so
busy
congratulating
himself
that
he
did
not
catch
the
note
of
irony
which
philip
could
not
prevent
from
coming
into
his
voice
lawson
quickerwitted
observed
it
and
looked
at
philip
curiously
his
own
picture
was
all
right
he
knew
that
a
day
or
two
before
and
he
was
vaguely
resentful
of
philips
attitude
but
he
was
surprised
at
the
sudden
question
which
philip
put
him
as
soon
as
the
american
was
gone
if
you
were
in
my
place
would
you
chuck
the
whole
thing
what
do
you
mean
i
wonder
if
its
worth
while
being
a
secondrate
painter
you
see
in
other
things
if
youre
a
doctor
or
if
youre
in
business
it
doesnt
matter
so
much
if
youre
mediocre
you
make
a
living
and
you
get
along
but
what
is
the
good
of
turning
out
secondrate
pictures
lawson
was
fond
of
philip
and
as
soon
as
he
thought
he
was
seriously
distressed
by
the
refusal
of
his
picture
he
set
himself
to
console
him
it
was
notorious
that
the
salon
had
refused
pictures
which
were
afterwards
famous
it
was
the
first
time
philip
had
sent
and
he
must
expect
a
rebuff
flanagans
success
was
explicable
his
picture
was
showy
and
superficial
it
was
just
the
sort
of
thing
a
languid
jury
would
see
merit
in
philip
grew
impatient
it
was
humiliating
that
lawson
should
think
him
capable
of
being
seriously
disturbed
by
so
trivial
a
calamity
and
would
not
realise
that
his
dejection
was
due
to
a
deepseated
distrust
of
his
powers
of
late
clutton
had
withdrawn
himself
somewhat
from
the
group
who
took
their
meals
at
graviers
and
lived
very
much
by
himself
flanagan
said
he
was
in
love
with
a
girl
but
cluttons
austere
countenance
did
not
suggest
passion
and
philip
thought
it
more
probable
that
he
separated
himself
from
his
friends
so
that
he
might
grow
clear
with
the
new
ideas
which
were
in
him
but
that
evening
when
the
others
had
left
the
restaurant
to
go
to
a
play
and
philip
was
sitting
alone
clutton
came
in
and
ordered
dinner
they
began
to
talk
and
finding
clutton
more
loquacious
and
less
sardonic
than
usual
philip
determined
to
take
advantage
of
his
good
humour
i
say
i
wish
youd
come
and
look
at
my
picture
he
said
id
like
to
know
what
you
think
of
it
no
i
wont
do
that
why
not
asked
philip
reddening
the
request
was
one
which
they
all
made
of
one
another
and
no
one
ever
thought
of
refusing
clutton
shrugged
his
shoulders
people
ask
you
for
criticism
but
they
only
want
praise
besides
whats
the
good
of
criticism
what
does
it
matter
if
your
picture
is
good
or
bad
it
matters
to
me
no
the
only
reason
that
one
paints
is
that
one
cant
help
it
its
a
function
like
any
of
the
other
functions
of
the
body
only
comparatively
few
people
have
got
it
one
paints
for
oneself
otherwise
one
would
commit
suicide
just
think
of
it
you
spend
god
knows
how
long
trying
to
get
something
on
to
canvas
putting
the
sweat
of
your
soul
into
it
and
what
is
the
result
ten
to
one
it
will
be
refused
at
the
salon
if
its
accepted
people
glance
at
it
for
ten
seconds
as
they
pass
if
youre
lucky
some
ignorant
fool
will
buy
it
and
put
it
on
his
walls
and
look
at
it
as
little
as
he
looks
at
his
diningroom
table
criticism
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
artist
it
judges
objectively
but
the
objective
doesnt
concern
the
artist
clutton
put
his
hands
over
his
eyes
so
that
he
might
concentrate
his
mind
on
what
he
wanted
to
say
the
artist
gets
a
peculiar
sensation
from
something
he
sees
and
is
impelled
to
express
it
and
he
doesnt
know
why
he
can
only
express
his
feeling
by
lines
and
colours
its
like
a
musician
hell
read
a
line
or
two
and
a
certain
combination
of
notes
presents
itself
to
him
he
doesnt
know
why
such
and
such
words
call
forth
in
him
such
and
such
notes
they
just
do
and
ill
tell
you
another
reason
why
criticism
is
meaningless
a
great
painter
forces
the
world
to
see
nature
as
he
sees
it
but
in
the
next
generation
another
painter
sees
the
world
in
another
way
and
then
the
public
judges
him
not
by
himself
but
by
his
predecessor
so
the
barbizon
people
taught
our
fathers
to
look
at
trees
in
a
certain
manner
and
when
monet
came
along
and
painted
differently
people
said
but
trees
arent
like
that
it
never
struck
them
that
trees
are
exactly
how
a
painter
chooses
to
see
them
we
paint
from
within
outwardsif
we
force
our
vision
on
the
world
it
calls
us
great
painters
if
we
dont
it
ignores
us
but
we
are
the
same
we
dont
attach
any
meaning
to
greatness
or
to
smallness
what
happens
to
our
work
afterwards
is
unimportant
we
have
got
all
we
could
out
of
it
while
we
were
doing
it
there
was
a
pause
while
clutton
with
voracious
appetite
devoured
the
food
that
was
set
before
him
philip
smoking
a
cheap
cigar
observed
him
closely
the
ruggedness
of
the
head
which
looked
as
though
it
were
carved
from
a
stone
refractory
to
the
sculptors
chisel
the
rough
mane
of
dark
hair
the
great
nose
and
the
massive
bones
of
the
jaw
suggested
a
man
of
strength
and
yet
philip
wondered
whether
perhaps
the
mask
conculed
a
strange
weakness
cluttons
refusal
to
show
his
work
might
be
sheer
vanity
he
could
not
bear
the
thought
of
anyones
criticism
and
he
would
not
expose
himself
to
the
chance
of
a
refusal
from
the
salon
he
wanted
to
be
received
as
a
master
and
would
not
risk
comparisons
with
other
work
which
might
force
him
to
diminish
his
own
opinion
of
himself
during
the
eighteen
months
philip
had
known
him
clutton
had
grown
more
harsh
and
bitter
though
he
would
not
come
out
into
the
open
and
compete
with
his
fellows
he
was
indignant
with
the
facile
success
of
those
who
did
he
had
no
patience
with
lawson
and
the
pair
were
no
longer
on
the
intimate
terms
upon
which
they
had
been
when
philip
first
knew
them
lawsons
all
right
he
said
contemptuously
hell
go
back
to
england
become
a
fashionable
portrait
painter
urn
ten
thousand
a
year
and
be
an
a
r
a
before
hes
forty
portraits
done
by
hand
for
the
nobility
and
gentry
philip
too
looked
into
the
future
and
he
saw
clutton
in
twenty
years
bitter
lonely
savage
and
unknown
still
in
paris
for
the
life
there
had
got
into
his
bones
ruling
a
small
cenacle
with
a
savage
tongue
at
war
with
himself
and
the
world
producing
little
in
his
increasing
passion
for
a
perfection
he
could
not
reach
and
perhaps
sinking
at
last
into
drunkenness
of
late
philip
had
been
captivated
by
an
idea
that
since
one
had
only
one
life
it
was
important
to
make
a
success
of
it
but
he
did
not
count
success
by
the
acquiring
of
money
or
the
achieving
of
fame
he
did
not
quite
know
yet
what
he
meant
by
it
perhaps
variety
of
experience
and
the
making
the
most
of
his
abilities
it
was
plain
anyway
that
the
life
which
clutton
seemed
destined
to
was
failure
its
only
justification
would
be
the
painting
of
imperishable
masterpieces
he
recollected
cronshaws
whimsical
metaphor
of
the
persian
carpet
he
had
thought
of
it
often
but
cronshaw
with
his
faunlike
humour
had
refused
to
make
his
meaning
clear
he
repeated
that
it
had
none
unless
one
discovered
it
for
oneself
it
was
this
desire
to
make
a
success
of
life
which
was
at
the
bottom
of
philips
uncertainty
about
continuing
his
artistic
career
but
clutton
began
to
talk
again
dyou
remember
my
telling
you
about
that
chap
i
met
in
brittany
i
saw
him
the
other
day
here
hes
just
off
to
tahiti
he
was
broke
to
the
world
he
was
a
brasseur
daffaires
a
stockbroker
i
suppose
you
call
it
in
english
and
he
had
a
wife
and
family
and
he
was
earning
a
large
income
he
chucked
it
all
to
become
a
painter
he
just
went
off
and
settled
down
in
brittany
and
began
to
paint
he
hadnt
got
any
money
and
did
the
next
best
thing
to
starving
and
what
about
his
wife
and
family
asked
philip
oh
he
dropped
them
he
left
them
to
starve
on
their
own
account
it
sounds
a
pretty
lowdown
thing
to
do
oh
my
dear
fellow
if
you
want
to
be
a
gentleman
you
must
give
up
being
an
artist
theyve
got
nothing
to
do
with
one
another
you
hear
of
men
painting
potboilers
to
keep
an
aged
motherwell
it
shows
theyre
excellent
sons
but
its
no
excuse
for
bad
work
theyre
only
tradesmen
an
artist
would
let
his
mother
go
to
the
workhouse
theres
a
writer
i
know
over
here
who
told
me
that
his
wife
died
in
childbirth
he
was
in
love
with
her
and
he
was
mad
with
grief
but
as
he
sat
at
the
bedside
watching
her
die
he
found
himself
making
mental
notes
of
how
she
looked
and
what
she
said
and
the
things
he
was
feeling
gentlemanly
wasnt
it
but
is
your
friend
a
good
painter
asked
philip
no
not
yet
he
paints
just
like
pissarro
he
hasnt
found
himself
but
hes
got
a
sense
of
colour
and
a
sense
of
decoration
but
that
isnt
the
question
its
the
feeling
and
that
hes
got
hes
behaved
like
a
perfect
cad
to
his
wife
and
children
hes
always
behaving
like
a
perfect
cad
the
way
he
treats
the
people
whove
helped
himand
sometimes
hes
been
saved
from
starvation
merely
by
the
kindness
of
his
friendsis
simply
beastly
he
just
happens
to
be
a
great
artist
philip
pondered
over
the
man
who
was
willing
to
sacrifice
everything
comfort
home
money
love
honour
duty
for
the
sake
of
getting
on
to
canvas
with
paint
the
emotion
which
the
world
gave
him
it
was
magnificent
and
yet
his
courage
failed
him
thinking
of
cronshaw
recalled
to
him
the
fact
that
he
had
not
seen
him
for
a
week
and
so
when
clutton
left
him
he
wandered
along
to
the
cafe
in
which
he
was
certain
to
find
the
writer
during
the
first
few
months
of
his
stay
in
paris
philip
had
accepted
as
gospel
all
that
cronshaw
said
but
philip
had
a
practical
outlook
and
he
grew
impatient
with
the
theories
which
resulted
in
no
action
cronshaws
slim
bundle
of
poetry
did
not
seem
a
substantial
result
for
a
life
which
was
sordid
philip
could
not
wrench
out
of
his
nature
the
instincts
of
the
middleclass
from
which
he
came
and
the
penury
the
hack
work
which
cronshaw
did
to
keep
body
and
soul
together
the
monotony
of
existence
between
the
slovenly
attic
and
the
cafe
table
jarred
with
his
respectability
cronshaw
was
astute
enough
to
know
that
the
young
man
disapproved
of
him
and
he
attacked
his
philistinism
with
an
irony
which
was
sometimes
playful
but
often
very
keen
youre
a
tradesman
he
told
philip
you
want
to
invest
life
in
consols
so
that
it
shall
bring
you
in
a
safe
three
per
cent
im
a
spendthrift
i
run
through
my
capital
i
shall
spend
my
last
penny
with
my
last
heartbeat
the
metaphor
irritated
philip
because
it
assumed
for
the
speaker
a
romantic
attitude
and
cast
a
slur
upon
the
position
which
philip
instinctively
felt
had
more
to
say
for
it
than
he
could
think
of
at
the
moment
but
this
evening
philip
undecided
wanted
to
talk
about
himself
fortunately
it
was
late
already
and
cronshaws
pile
of
saucers
on
the
table
each
indicating
a
drink
suggested
that
he
was
prepared
to
take
an
independent
view
of
things
in
general
i
wonder
if
youd
give
me
some
advice
said
philip
suddenly
you
wont
take
it
will
you
philip
shrugged
his
shoulders
impatiently
i
dont
believe
i
shall
ever
do
much
good
as
a
painter
i
dont
see
any
use
in
being
secondrate
im
thinking
of
chucking
it
why
shouldnt
you
philip
hesitated
for
an
instant
i
suppose
i
like
the
life
a
change
came
over
cronshaws
placid
round
face
the
corners
of
the
mouth
were
suddenly
depressed
the
eyes
sunk
dully
in
their
orbits
he
seemed
to
become
strangely
bowed
and
old
this
he
cried
looking
round
the
cafe
in
which
they
sat
his
voice
really
trembled
a
little
if
you
can
get
out
of
it
do
while
theres
time
philip
stared
at
him
with
astonishment
but
the
sight
of
emotion
always
made
him
feel
shy
and
he
dropped
his
eyes
he
knew
that
he
was
looking
upon
the
tragedy
of
failure
there
was
silence
philip
thought
that
cronshaw
was
looking
upon
his
own
life
and
perhaps
he
considered
his
youth
with
its
bright
hopes
and
the
disappointments
which
wore
out
the
radiancy
the
wretched
monotony
of
pleasure
and
the
black
future
philips
eyes
rested
on
the
little
pile
of
saucers
and
he
knew
that
cronshaws
were
on
them
too
chapter
li
two
months
passed
it
seemed
to
philip
brooding
over
these
matters
that
in
the
true
painters
writers
musicians
there
was
a
power
which
drove
them
to
such
complete
absorption
in
their
work
as
to
make
it
inevitable
for
them
to
subordinate
life
to
art
succumbing
to
an
influence
they
never
realised
they
were
merely
dupes
of
the
instinct
that
possessed
them
and
life
slipped
through
their
fingers
unlived
but
he
had
a
feeling
that
life
was
to
be
lived
rather
than
portrayed
and
he
wanted
to
search
out
the
various
experiences
of
it
and
wring
from
each
moment
all
the
emotion
that
it
offered
he
made
up
his
mind
at
length
to
take
a
certain
step
and
abide
by
the
result
and
having
made
up
his
mind
he
determined
to
take
the
step
at
once
luckily
enough
the
next
morning
was
one
of
foinets
days
and
he
resolved
to
ask
him
pointblank
whether
it
was
worth
his
while
to
go
on
with
the
study
of
art
he
had
never
forgotten
the
masters
brutal
advice
to
fanny
price
it
had
been
sound
philip
could
never
get
fanny
entirely
out
of
his
head
the
studio
seemed
strange
without
her
and
now
and
then
the
gesture
of
one
of
the
women
working
there
or
the
tone
of
a
voice
would
give
him
a
sudden
start
reminding
him
of
her
her
presence
was
more
noticuble
now
she
was
dead
than
it
had
ever
been
during
her
life
and
he
often
dreamed
of
her
at
night
waking
with
a
cry
of
terror
it
was
horrible
to
think
of
all
the
suffering
she
must
have
endured
philip
knew
that
on
the
days
foinet
came
to
the
studio
he
lunched
at
a
little
restaurant
in
the
rue
dodessa
and
he
hurried
his
own
meal
so
that
he
could
go
and
wait
outside
till
the
painter
came
out
philip
walked
up
and
down
the
crowded
street
and
at
last
saw
monsieur
foinet
walking
with
bent
head
towards
him
philip
was
very
nervous
but
he
forced
himself
to
go
up
to
him
pardon
monsieur
i
should
like
to
speak
to
you
for
one
moment
foinet
gave
him
a
rapid
glance
recognised
him
but
did
not
smile
a
greeting
speak
he
said
ive
been
working
here
nearly
two
years
now
under
you
i
wanted
to
ask
you
to
tell
me
frankly
if
you
think
it
worth
while
for
me
to
continue
philips
voice
was
trembling
a
little
foinet
walked
on
without
looking
up
philip
watching
his
face
saw
no
trace
of
expression
upon
it
i
dont
understand
im
very
poor
if
i
have
no
talent
i
would
sooner
do
something
else
dont
you
know
if
you
have
talent
all
my
friends
know
they
have
talent
but
i
am
aware
some
of
them
are
mistaken
foinets
bitter
mouth
outlined
the
shadow
of
a
smile
and
he
asked
do
you
live
near
here
philip
told
him
where
his
studio
was
foinet
turned
round
let
us
go
there
you
shall
show
me
your
work
now
cried
philip
why
not
philip
had
nothing
to
say
he
walked
silently
by
the
masters
side
he
felt
horribly
sick
it
had
never
struck
him
that
foinet
would
wish
to
see
his
things
there
and
then
he
meant
so
that
he
might
have
time
to
prepare
himself
to
ask
him
if
he
would
mind
coming
at
some
future
date
or
whether
he
might
bring
them
to
foinets
studio
he
was
trembling
with
anxiety
in
his
heart
he
hoped
that
foinet
would
look
at
his
picture
and
that
rare
smile
would
come
into
his
face
and
he
would
shake
philips
hand
and
say
pas
mal
go
on
my
lad
you
have
talent
real
talent
philips
heart
swelled
at
the
thought
it
was
such
a
relief
such
a
joy
now
he
could
go
on
with
courage
and
what
did
hardship
matter
privation
and
disappointment
if
he
arrived
at
last
he
had
worked
very
hard
it
would
be
too
cruel
if
all
that
industry
were
futile
and
then
with
a
start
he
remembered
that
he
had
heard
fanny
price
say
just
that
they
arrived
at
the
house
and
philip
was
seized
with
fear
if
he
had
dared
he
would
have
asked
foinet
to
go
away
he
did
not
want
to
know
the
truth
they
went
in
and
the
concierge
handed
him
a
letter
as
they
passed
he
glanced
at
the
envelope
and
recognised
his
uncles
handwriting
foinet
followed
him
up
the
stairs
philip
could
think
of
nothing
to
say
foinet
was
mute
and
the
silence
got
on
his
nerves
the
professor
sat
down
and
philip
without
a
word
placed
before
him
the
picture
which
the
salon
had
rejected
foinet
nodded
but
did
not
speak
then
philip
showed
him
the
two
portraits
he
had
made
of
ruth
chalice
two
or
three
landscapes
which
he
had
painted
at
moret
and
a
number
of
sketches
thats
all
he
said
presently
with
a
nervous
laugh
monsieur
foinet
rolled
himself
a
cigarette
and
lit
it
you
have
very
little
private
means
he
asked
at
last
very
little
answered
philip
with
a
sudden
feeling
of
cold
at
his
heart
not
enough
to
live
on
there
is
nothing
so
degrading
as
the
constant
anxiety
about
ones
means
of
livelihood
i
have
nothing
but
contempt
for
the
people
who
despise
money
they
are
hypocrites
or
fools
money
is
like
a
sixth
sense
without
which
you
cannot
make
a
complete
use
of
the
other
five
without
an
adequate
income
half
the
possibilities
of
life
are
shut
off
the
only
thing
to
be
careful
about
is
that
you
do
not
pay
more
than
a
shilling
for
the
shilling
you
earn
you
will
hear
people
say
that
poverty
is
the
best
spur
to
the
artist
they
have
never
felt
the
iron
of
it
in
their
flesh
they
do
not
know
how
mean
it
makes
you
it
exposes
you
to
endless
humiliation
it
cuts
your
wings
it
eats
into
your
soul
like
a
cancer
it
is
not
wealth
one
asks
for
but
just
enough
to
preserve
ones
dignity
to
work
unhampered
to
be
generous
frank
and
independent
i
pity
with
all
my
heart
the
artist
whether
he
writes
or
paints
who
is
entirely
dependent
for
subsistence
upon
his
art
philip
quietly
put
away
the
various
things
which
he
had
shown
im
afraid
that
sounds
as
if
you
didnt
think
i
had
much
chance
monsieur
foinet
slightly
shrugged
his
shoulders
you
have
a
certain
manual
dexterity
with
hard
work
and
perseverance
there
is
no
reason
why
you
should
not
become
a
careful
not
incompetent
painter
you
would
find
hundreds
who
painted
worse
than
you
hundreds
who
painted
as
well
i
see
no
talent
in
anything
you
have
shown
me
i
see
industry
and
intelligence
you
will
never
be
anything
but
mediocre
philip
obliged
himself
to
answer
quite
steadily
im
very
grateful
to
you
for
having
taken
so
much
trouble
i
cant
thank
you
enough
monsieur
foinet
got
up
and
made
as
if
to
go
but
he
changed
his
mind
and
stopping
put
his
hand
on
philips
shoulder
but
if
you
were
to
ask
me
my
advice
i
should
say
take
your
courage
in
both
hands
and
try
your
luck
at
something
else
it
sounds
very
hard
but
let
me
tell
you
this
i
would
give
all
i
have
in
the
world
if
someone
had
given
me
that
advice
when
i
was
your
age
and
i
had
taken
it
philip
looked
up
at
him
with
surprise
the
master
forced
his
lips
into
a
smile
but
his
eyes
remained
grave
and
sad
it
is
cruel
to
discover
ones
mediocrity
only
when
it
is
too
late
it
does
not
improve
the
temper
he
gave
a
little
laugh
as
he
said
the
last
words
and
quickly
walked
out
of
the
room
philip
mechanically
took
up
the
letter
from
his
uncle
the
sight
of
his
handwriting
made
him
anxious
for
it
was
his
aunt
who
always
wrote
to
him
she
had
been
ill
for
the
last
three
months
and
he
had
offered
to
go
over
to
england
and
see
her
but
she
fearing
it
would
interfere
with
his
work
had
refused
she
did
not
want
him
to
put
himself
to
inconvenience
she
said
she
would
wait
till
august
and
then
she
hoped
he
would
come
and
stay
at
the
vicarage
for
two
or
three
weeks
if
by
any
chance
she
grew
worse
she
would
let
him
know
since
she
did
not
wish
to
die
without
seeing
him
again
if
his
uncle
wrote
to
him
it
must
be
because
she
was
too
ill
to
hold
a
pen
philip
opened
the
letter
it
ran
as
follows
my
dear
philip
i
regret
to
inform
you
that
your
dear
aunt
departed
this
life
early
this
morning
she
died
very
suddenly
but
quite
peacefully
the
change
for
the
worse
was
so
rapid
that
we
had
no
time
to
send
for
you
she
was
fully
prepared
for
the
end
and
entered
into
rest
with
the
complete
assurance
of
a
blessed
resurrection
and
with
resignation
to
the
divine
will
of
our
blessed
lord
jesus
christ
your
aunt
would
have
liked
you
to
be
present
at
the
funeral
so
i
trust
you
will
come
as
soon
as
you
can
there
is
naturally
a
great
deal
of
work
thrown
upon
my
shoulders
and
i
am
very
much
upset
i
trust
that
you
will
be
able
to
do
everything
for
me
your
affectionate
uncle
william
carey
chapter
lii
next
day
philip
arrived
at
blackstable
since
the
death
of
his
mother
he
had
never
lost
anyone
closely
connected
with
him
his
aunts
death
shocked
him
and
filled
him
also
with
a
curious
fear
he
felt
for
the
first
time
his
own
mortality
he
could
not
realise
what
life
would
be
for
his
uncle
without
the
constant
companionship
of
the
woman
who
had
loved
and
tended
him
for
forty
years
he
expected
to
find
him
broken
down
with
hopeless
grief
he
dreaded
the
first
meeting
he
knew
that
he
could
say
nothing
which
would
be
of
use
he
rehearsed
to
himself
a
number
of
apposite
speeches
he
entered
the
vicarage
by
the
sidedoor
and
went
into
the
diningroom
uncle
william
was
reading
the
paper
your
train
was
late
he
said
looking
up
philip
was
prepared
to
give
way
to
his
emotion
but
the
matteroffact
reception
startled
him
his
uncle
subdued
but
calm
handed
him
the
paper
theres
a
very
nice
little
paragraph
about
her
in
the
blackstable
times
he
said
philip
read
it
mechanically
would
you
like
to
come
up
and
see
her
philip
nodded
and
together
they
walked
upstairs
aunt
louisa
was
lying
in
the
middle
of
the
large
bed
with
flowers
all
round
her
would
you
like
to
say
a
short
prayer
said
the
vicar
he
sank
on
his
knees
and
because
it
was
expected
of
him
philip
followed
his
example
he
looked
at
the
little
shrivelled
face
he
was
only
conscious
of
one
emotion
what
a
wasted
life
in
a
minute
mr
carey
gave
a
cough
and
stood
up
he
pointed
to
a
wreath
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
thats
from
the
squire
he
said
he
spoke
in
a
low
voice
as
though
he
were
in
church
but
one
felt
that
as
a
clergyman
he
found
himself
quite
at
home
i
expect
tea
is
ready
they
went
down
again
to
the
diningroom
the
drawn
blinds
gave
a
lugubrious
aspect
the
vicar
sat
at
the
end
of
the
table
at
which
his
wife
had
always
sat
and
poured
out
the
tea
with
ceremony
philip
could
not
help
feeling
that
neither
of
them
should
have
been
able
to
eat
anything
but
when
he
saw
that
his
uncles
appetite
was
unimpaired
he
fell
to
with
his
usual
heartiness
they
did
not
speak
for
a
while
philip
set
himself
to
eat
an
excellent
cake
with
the
air
of
grief
which
he
felt
was
decent
things
have
changed
a
great
deal
since
i
was
a
curate
said
the
vicar
presently
in
my
young
days
the
moumers
used
always
to
be
given
a
pair
of
black
gloves
and
a
piece
of
black
silk
for
their
hats
poor
louisa
used
to
make
the
silk
into
dresses
she
always
said
that
twelve
funerals
gave
her
a
new
dress
then
he
told
philip
who
had
sent
wreaths
there
were
twentyfour
of
them
already
when
mrs
rawlingson
wife
of
the
vicar
at
feme
had
died
she
had
had
thirtytwo
but
probably
a
good
many
more
would
come
the
next
day
the
funeral
would
start
at
eleven
oclock
from
the
vicarage
and
they
should
beat
mrs
rawlingson
easily
louisa
never
liked
mrs
rawlingson
i
shall
take
the
funeral
myself
i
promised
louisa
i
would
never
let
anyone
else
bury
her
philip
looked
at
his
uncle
with
disapproval
when
he
took
a
second
piece
of
cake
under
the
circumstances
he
could
not
help
thinking
it
greedy
mary
ann
certainly
makes
capital
cakes
im
afraid
no
one
else
will
make
such
good
ones
shes
not
going
cried
philip
with
astonishment
mary
ann
had
been
at
the
vicarage
ever
since
he
could
remember
she
never
forgot
his
birthday
but
made
a
point
always
of
sending
him
a
trifle
absurd
but
touching
he
had
a
real
affection
for
her
yes
answered
mr
carey
i
didnt
think
it
would
do
to
have
a
single
woman
in
the
house
but
good
heavens
she
must
be
over
forty
yes
i
think
she
is
but
shes
been
rather
troublesome
lately
shes
been
inclined
to
take
too
much
on
herself
and
i
thought
this
was
a
very
good
opportunity
to
give
her
notice
its
certainly
one
which
isnt
likely
to
recur
said
philip
he
took
out
a
cigarette
but
his
uncle
prevented
him
from
lighting
it
not
till
after
the
funeral
philip
he
said
gently
all
right
said
philip
it
wouldnt
be
quite
respectful
to
smoke
in
the
house
so
long
as
your
poor
aunt
louisa
is
upstairs
josiah
graves
churchwarden
and
manager
of
the
bank
came
back
to
dinner
at
the
vicarage
after
the
funeral
the
blinds
had
been
drawn
up
and
philip
against
his
will
felt
a
curious
sensation
of
relief
the
body
in
the
house
had
made
him
uncomfortable
in
life
the
poor
woman
had
been
all
that
was
kind
and
gentle
and
yet
when
she
lay
upstairs
in
her
bedroom
cold
and
stark
it
seemed
as
though
she
cast
upon
the
survivors
a
baleful
influence
the
thought
horrified
philip
he
found
himself
alone
for
a
minute
or
two
in
the
diningroom
with
the
churchwarden
i
hope
youll
be
able
to
stay
with
your
uncle
a
while
he
said
i
dont
think
he
ought
to
be
left
alone
just
yet
i
havent
made
any
plans
answered
philip
if
he
wants
me
i
shall
be
very
pleased
to
stay
by
way
of
cheering
the
bereaved
husband
the
churchwarden
during
dinner
talked
of
a
recent
fire
at
blackstable
which
had
partly
destroyed
the
wesleyan
chapel
i
hear
they
werent
insured
he
said
with
a
little
smile
that
wont
make
any
difference
said
the
vicar
theyll
get
as
much
money
as
they
want
to
rebuild
chapel
people
are
always
ready
to
give
money
i
see
that
holden
sent
a
wreath
holden
was
the
dissenting
minister
and
though
for
christs
sake
who
died
for
both
of
them
mr
carey
nodded
to
him
in
the
street
he
did
not
speak
to
him
i
think
it
was
very
pushing
he
remarked
there
were
fortyone
wreaths
yours
was
beautiful
philip
and
i
admired
it
very
much
dont
mention
it
said
the
banker
he
had
noticed
with
satisfaction
that
it
was
larger
than
anyones
else
it
had
looked
very
well
they
began
to
discuss
the
people
who
attended
the
funeral
shops
had
been
closed
for
it
and
the
churchwarden
took
out
of
his
pocket
the
notice
which
had
been
printed
owing
to
the
funeral
of
mrs
carey
this
establishment
will
not
be
opened
till
one
oclock
it
was
my
idea
he
said
i
think
it
was
very
nice
of
them
to
close
said
the
vicar
poor
louisa
would
have
appreciated
that
philip
ate
his
dinner
mary
ann
had
treated
the
day
as
sunday
and
they
had
roast
chicken
and
a
gooseberry
tart
i
suppose
you
havent
thought
about
a
tombstone
yet
said
the
churchwarden
yes
i
have
i
thought
of
a
plain
stone
cross
louisa
was
always
against
ostentation
i
dont
think
one
can
do
much
better
than
a
cross
if
youre
thinking
of
a
text
what
do
you
say
to
with
christ
which
is
far
better
the
vicar
pursed
his
lips
it
was
just
like
bismarck
to
try
and
settle
everything
himself
he
did
not
like
that
text
it
seemed
to
cast
an
aspersion
on
himself
i
dont
think
i
should
put
that
i
much
prefer
the
lord
has
given
and
the
lord
has
taken
away
oh
do
you
that
always
seems
to
me
a
little
indifferent
the
vicar
answered
with
some
acidity
and
mr
graves
replied
in
a
tone
which
the
widower
thought
too
authoritative
for
the
occasion
things
were
going
rather
far
if
he
could
not
choose
his
own
text
for
his
own
wifes
tombstone
there
was
a
pause
and
then
the
conversation
drifted
to
parish
matters
philip
went
into
the
garden
to
smoke
his
pipe
he
sat
on
a
bench
and
suddenly
began
to
laugh
hysterically
a
few
days
later
his
uncle
expressed
the
hope
that
he
would
spend
the
next
few
weeks
at
blackstable
yes
that
will
suit
me
very
well
said
philip
i
suppose
itll
do
if
you
go
back
to
paris
in
september
philip
did
not
reply
he
had
thought
much
of
what
foinet
said
to
him
but
he
was
still
so
undecided
that
he
did
not
wish
to
speak
of
the
future
there
would
be
something
fine
in
giving
up
art
because
he
was
convinced
that
he
could
not
excel
but
unfortunately
it
would
seem
so
only
to
himself
to
others
it
would
be
an
admission
of
defeat
and
he
did
not
want
to
confess
that
he
was
beaten
he
was
an
obstinate
fellow
and
the
suspicion
that
his
talent
did
not
lie
in
one
direction
made
him
inclined
to
force
circumstances
and
aim
notwithstanding
precisely
in
that
direction
he
could
not
bear
that
his
friends
should
laugh
at
him
this
might
have
prevented
him
from
ever
taking
the
definite
step
of
abandoning
the
study
of
painting
but
the
different
environment
made
him
on
a
sudden
see
things
differently
like
many
another
he
discovered
that
crossing
the
channel
makes
things
which
had
seemed
important
singularly
futile
the
life
which
had
been
so
charming
that
he
could
not
bear
to
leave
it
now
seemed
inept
he
was
seized
with
a
distaste
for
the
cafes
the
restaurants
with
their
illcooked
food
the
shabby
way
in
which
they
all
lived
he
did
not
care
any
more
what
his
friends
thought
about
him
cronshaw
with
his
rhetoric
mrs
otter
with
her
respectability
ruth
chalice
with
her
affectations
lawson
and
clutton
with
their
quarrels
he
felt
a
revulsion
from
them
all
he
wrote
to
lawson
and
asked
him
to
send
over
all
his
belongings
a
week
later
they
arrived
when
he
unpacked
his
canvases
he
found
himself
able
to
examine
his
work
without
emotion
he
noticed
the
fact
with
interest
his
uncle
was
anxious
to
see
his
pictures
though
he
had
so
greatly
disapproved
of
philips
desire
to
go
to
paris
he
accepted
the
situation
now
with
equanimity
he
was
interested
in
the
life
of
students
and
constantly
put
philip
questions
about
it
he
was
in
fact
a
little
proud
of
him
because
he
was
a
painter
and
when
people
were
present
made
attempts
to
draw
him
out
he
looked
eagerly
at
the
studies
of
models
which
philip
showed
him
philip
set
before
him
his
portrait
of
miguel
ajuria
why
did
you
paint
him
asked
mr
carey
oh
i
wanted
a
model
and
his
head
interested
me
as
you
havent
got
anything
to
do
here
i
wonder
you
dont
paint
me
it
would
bore
you
to
sit
i
think
i
should
like
it
we
must
see
about
it
philip
was
amused
at
his
uncles
vanity
it
was
clear
that
he
was
dying
to
have
his
portrait
painted
to
get
something
for
nothing
was
a
chance
not
to
be
missed
for
two
or
three
days
he
threw
out
little
hints
he
reproached
philip
for
laziness
asked
him
when
he
was
going
to
start
work
and
finally
began
telling
everyone
he
met
that
philip
was
going
to
paint
him
at
last
there
came
a
rainy
day
and
after
breakfast
mr
carey
said
to
philip
now
what
dyou
say
to
starting
on
my
portrait
this
morning
philip
put
down
the
book
he
was
reading
and
leaned
back
in
his
chair
ive
given
up
painting
he
said
why
asked
his
uncle
in
astonishment
i
dont
think
theres
much
object
in
being
a
secondrate
painter
and
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
i
should
never
be
anything
else
you
surprise
me
before
you
went
to
paris
you
were
quite
certain
that
you
were
a
genius
i
was
mistaken
said
philip
i
should
have
thought
now
youd
taken
up
a
profession
youd
have
the
pride
to
stick
to
it
it
seems
to
me
that
what
you
lack
is
perseverance
philip
was
a
little
annoyed
that
his
uncle
did
not
even
see
how
truly
heroic
his
determination
was
a
rolling
stone
gathers
no
moss
proceeded
the
clergyman
philip
hated
that
proverb
above
all
and
it
seemed
to
him
perfectly
meaningless
his
uncle
had
repeated
it
often
during
the
arguments
which
had
preceded
his
departure
from
business
apparently
it
recalled
that
occasion
to
his
guardian
youre
no
longer
a
boy
you
know
you
must
begin
to
think
of
settling
down
first
you
insist
on
becoming
a
chartered
accountant
and
then
you
get
tired
of
that
and
you
want
to
become
a
painter
and
now
if
you
please
you
change
your
mind
again
it
points
to
he
hesitated
for
a
moment
to
consider
what
defects
of
character
exactly
it
indicated
and
philip
finished
the
sentence
irresolution
incompetence
want
of
foresight
and
lack
of
determination
the
vicar
looked
up
at
his
nephew
quickly
to
see
whether
he
was
laughing
at
him
philips
face
was
serious
but
there
was
a
twinkle
in
his
eyes
which
irritated
him
philip
should
really
be
getting
more
serious
he
felt
it
right
to
give
him
a
rap
over
the
knuckles
your
money
matters
have
nothing
to
do
with
me
now
youre
your
own
master
but
i
think
you
should
remember
that
your
money
wont
last
for
ever
and
the
unlucky
deformity
you
have
doesnt
exactly
make
it
easier
for
you
to
earn
your
living
philip
knew
by
now
that
whenever
anyone
was
angry
with
him
his
first
thought
was
to
say
something
about
his
clubfoot
his
estimate
of
the
human
race
was
determined
by
the
fact
that
scarcely
anyone
failed
to
resist
the
temptation
but
he
had
trained
himself
not
to
show
any
sign
that
the
reminder
wounded
him
he
had
even
acquired
control
over
the
blushing
which
in
his
boyhood
had
been
one
of
his
torments
as
you
justly
remark
he
answered
my
money
matters
have
nothing
to
do
with
you
and
i
am
my
own
master
at
all
events
you
will
do
me
the
justice
to
acknowledge
that
i
was
justified
in
my
opposition
when
you
made
up
your
mind
to
become
an
artstudent
i
dont
know
so
much
about
that
i
daresay
one
profits
more
by
the
mistakes
one
makes
off
ones
own
bat
than
by
doing
the
right
thing
on
somebodys
else
advice
ive
had
my
fling
and
i
dont
mind
settling
down
now
what
at
philip
was
not
prepared
for
the
question
since
in
fact
he
had
not
made
up
his
mind
he
had
thought
of
a
dozen
callings
the
most
suitable
thing
you
could
do
is
to
enter
your
fathers
profession
and
become
a
doctor
oddly
enough
that
is
precisely
what
i
intend
he
had
thought
of
doctoring
among
other
things
chiefly
because
it
was
an
occupation
which
seemed
to
give
a
good
deal
of
personal
freedom
and
his
experience
of
life
in
an
office
had
made
him
determine
never
to
have
anything
more
to
do
with
one
his
answer
to
the
vicar
slipped
out
almost
unawares
because
it
was
in
the
nature
of
a
repartee
it
amused
him
to
make
up
his
mind
in
that
accidental
way
and
he
resolved
then
and
there
to
enter
his
fathers
old
hospital
in
the
autumn
then
your
two
years
in
paris
may
be
regarded
as
so
much
wasted
time
i
dont
know
about
that
i
had
a
very
jolly
two
years
and
i
learned
one
or
two
useful
things
what
philip
reflected
for
an
instant
and
his
answer
was
not
devoid
of
a
gentle
desire
to
annoy
i
learned
to
look
at
hands
which
id
never
looked
at
before
and
instead
of
just
looking
at
houses
and
trees
i
learned
to
look
at
houses
and
trees
against
the
sky
and
i
learned
also
that
shadows
are
not
black
but
coloured
i
suppose
you
think
youre
very
clever
i
think
your
flippancy
is
quite
inane
chapter
liii
taking
the
paper
with
him
mr
carey
retired
to
his
study
philip
changed
his
chair
for
that
in
which
his
uncle
had
been
sitting
it
was
the
only
comfortable
one
in
the
room
and
looked
out
of
the
window
at
the
pouring
rain
even
in
that
sad
weather
there
was
something
restful
about
the
green
fields
that
stretched
to
the
horizon
there
was
an
intimate
charm
in
the
landscape
which
he
did
not
remember
ever
to
have
noticed
before
two
years
in
france
had
opened
his
eyes
to
the
beauty
of
his
own
countryside
he
thought
with
a
smile
of
his
uncles
remark
it
was
lucky
that
the
turn
of
his
mind
tended
to
flippancy
he
had
begun
to
realise
what
a
great
loss
he
had
sustained
in
the
death
of
his
father
and
mother
that
was
one
of
the
differences
in
his
life
which
prevented
him
from
seeing
things
in
the
same
way
as
other
people
the
love
of
parents
for
their
children
is
the
only
emotion
which
is
quite
disinterested
among
strangers
he
had
grown
up
as
best
he
could
but
he
had
seldom
been
used
with
patience
or
forbearance
he
prided
himself
on
his
selfcontrol
it
had
been
whipped
into
him
by
the
mockery
of
his
fellows
then
they
called
him
cynical
and
callous
he
had
acquired
calmness
of
demeanour
and
under
most
circumstances
an
unruffled
exterior
so
that
now
he
could
not
show
his
feelings
people
told
him
he
was
unemotional
but
he
knew
that
he
was
at
the
mercy
of
his
emotions
an
accidental
kindness
touched
him
so
much
that
sometimes
he
did
not
venture
to
speak
in
order
not
to
betray
the
unsteadiness
of
his
voice
he
remembered
the
bitterness
of
his
life
at
school
the
humiliation
which
he
had
endured
the
banter
which
had
made
him
morbidly
afraid
of
making
himself
ridiculous
and
he
remembered
the
loneliness
he
had
felt
since
faced
with
the
world
the
disillusion
and
the
disappointment
caused
by
the
difference
between
what
it
promised
to
his
active
imagination
and
what
it
gave
but
notwithstanding
he
was
able
to
look
at
himself
from
the
outside
and
smile
with
amusement
by
jove
if
i
werent
flippant
i
should
hang
myself
he
thought
cheerfully
his
mind
went
back
to
the
answer
he
had
given
his
uncle
when
he
asked
him
what
he
had
learnt
in
paris
he
had
learnt
a
good
deal
more
than
he
told
him
a
conversation
with
cronshaw
had
stuck
in
his
memory
and
one
phrase
he
had
used
a
commonplace
one
enough
had
set
his
brain
working
my
dear
fellow
cronshaw
said
theres
no
such
thing
as
abstract
morality
when
philip
ceased
to
believe
in
christianity
he
felt
that
a
great
weight
was
taken
from
his
shoulders
casting
off
the
responsibility
which
weighed
down
every
action
when
every
action
was
infinitely
important
for
the
welfare
of
his
immortal
soul
he
experienced
a
vivid
sense
of
liberty
but
he
knew
now
that
this
was
an
illusion
when
he
put
away
the
religion
in
which
he
had
been
brought
up
he
had
kept
unimpaired
the
morality
which
was
part
and
parcel
of
it
he
made
up
his
mind
therefore
to
think
things
out
for
himself
he
determined
to
be
swayed
by
no
prejudices
he
swept
away
the
virtues
and
the
vices
the
established
laws
of
good
and
evil
with
the
idea
of
finding
out
the
rules
of
life
for
himself
he
did
not
know
whether
rules
were
necessary
at
all
that
was
one
of
the
things
he
wanted
to
discover
clearly
much
that
seemed
valid
seemed
so
only
because
he
had
been
taught
it
from
his
earliest
youth
he
had
read
a
number
of
books
but
they
did
not
help
him
much
for
they
were
based
on
the
morality
of
christianity
and
even
the
writers
who
emphasised
the
fact
that
they
did
not
believe
in
it
were
never
satisfied
till
they
had
framed
a
system
of
ethics
in
accordance
with
that
of
the
sermon
on
the
mount
it
seemed
hardly
worth
while
to
read
a
long
volume
in
order
to
learn
that
you
ought
to
behave
exactly
like
everybody
else
philip
wanted
to
find
out
how
he
ought
to
behave
and
he
thought
he
could
prevent
himself
from
being
influenced
by
the
opinions
that
surrounded
him
but
meanwhile
he
had
to
go
on
living
and
until
he
formed
a
theory
of
conduct
he
made
himself
a
provisional
rule
follow
your
inclinations
with
due
regard
to
the
policeman
round
the
corner
he
thought
the
best
thing
he
had
gained
in
paris
was
a
complete
liberty
of
spirit
and
he
felt
himself
at
last
absolutely
free
in
a
desultory
way
he
had
read
a
good
deal
of
philosophy
and
he
looked
forward
with
delight
to
the
leisure
of
the
next
few
months
he
began
to
read
at
haphazard
he
entered
upon
each
system
with
a
little
thrill
of
excitement
expecting
to
find
in
each
some
guide
by
which
he
could
rule
his
conduct
he
felt
himself
like
a
traveller
in
unknown
countries
and
as
he
pushed
forward
the
enterprise
fascinated
him
he
read
emotionally
as
other
men
read
pure
literature
and
his
heart
leaped
as
he
discovered
in
noble
words
what
himself
had
obscurely
felt
his
mind
was
concrete
and
moved
with
difficulty
in
regions
of
the
abstract
but
even
when
he
could
not
follow
the
reasoning
it
gave
him
a
curious
pleasure
to
follow
the
tortuosities
of
thoughts
that
threaded
their
nimble
way
on
the
edge
of
the
incomprehensible
sometimes
great
philosophers
seemed
to
have
nothing
to
say
to
him
but
at
others
he
recognised
a
mind
with
which
he
felt
himself
at
home
he
was
like
the
explorer
in
central
africa
who
comes
suddenly
upon
wide
uplands
with
great
trees
in
them
and
stretches
of
meadow
so
that
he
might
fancy
himself
in
an
english
park
he
delighted
in
the
robust
common
sense
of
thomas
hobbes
spinoza
filled
him
with
awe
he
had
never
before
come
in
contact
with
a
mind
so
noble
so
unapproachable
and
austere
it
reminded
him
of
that
statue
by
rodin
lage
dairain
which
he
passionately
admired
and
then
there
was
hume
the
scepticism
of
that
charming
philosopher
touched
a
kindred
note
in
philip
and
revelling
in
the
lucid
style
which
seemed
able
to
put
complicated
thought
into
simple
words
musical
and
measured
he
read
as
he
might
have
read
a
novel
a
smile
of
pleasure
on
his
lips
but
in
none
could
he
find
exactly
what
he
wanted
he
had
read
somewhere
that
every
man
was
born
a
platonist
an
aristotelian
a
stoic
or
an
epicurean
and
the
history
of
george
henry
lewes
besides
telling
you
that
philosophy
was
all
moonshine
was
there
to
show
that
the
thought
of
each
philospher
was
inseparably
connected
with
the
man
he
was
when
you
knew
that
you
could
guess
to
a
great
extent
the
philosophy
he
wrote
it
looked
as
though
you
did
not
act
in
a
certain
way
because
you
thought
in
a
certain
way
but
rather
that
you
thought
in
a
certain
way
because
you
were
made
in
a
certain
way
truth
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
there
was
no
such
thing
as
truth
each
man
was
his
own
philosopher
and
the
elaborate
systems
which
the
great
men
of
the
past
had
composed
were
only
valid
for
the
writers
the
thing
then
was
to
discover
what
one
was
and
ones
system
of
philosophy
would
devise
itself
it
seemed
to
philip
that
there
were
three
things
to
find
out
mans
relation
to
the
world
he
lives
in
mans
relation
with
the
men
among
whom
he
lives
and
finally
mans
relation
to
himself
he
made
an
elaborate
plan
of
study
the
advantage
of
living
abroad
is
that
coming
in
contact
with
the
manners
and
customs
of
the
people
among
whom
you
live
you
observe
them
from
the
outside
and
see
that
they
have
not
the
necessity
which
those
who
practise
them
believe
you
cannot
fail
to
discover
that
the
beliefs
which
to
you
are
selfevident
to
the
foreigner
are
absurd
the
year
in
germany
the
long
stay
in
paris
had
prepared
philip
to
receive
the
sceptical
teaching
which
came
to
him
now
with
such
a
feeling
of
relief
he
saw
that
nothing
was
good
and
nothing
was
evil
things
were
merely
adapted
to
an
end
he
read
the
origin
of
species
it
seemed
to
offer
an
explanation
of
much
that
troubled
him
he
was
like
an
explorer
now
who
has
reasoned
that
certain
natural
features
must
present
themselves
and
beating
up
a
broad
river
finds
here
the
tributary
that
he
expected
there
the
fertile
populated
plains
and
further
on
the
mountains
when
some
great
discovery
is
made
the
world
is
surprised
afterwards
that
it
was
not
accepted
at
once
and
even
on
those
who
acknowledge
its
truth
the
effect
is
unimportant
the
first
readers
of
the
origin
of
species
accepted
it
with
their
reason
but
their
emotions
which
are
the
ground
of
conduct
were
untouched
philip
was
born
a
generation
after
this
great
book
was
published
and
much
that
horrified
its
contemporaries
had
passed
into
the
feeling
of
the
time
so
that
he
was
able
to
accept
it
with
a
joyful
heart
he
was
intensely
moved
by
the
grandeur
of
the
struggle
for
life
and
the
ethical
rule
which
it
suggested
seemed
to
fit
in
with
his
predispositions
he
said
to
himself
that
might
was
right
society
stood
on
one
side
an
organism
with
its
own
laws
of
growth
and
selfpreservation
while
the
individual
stood
on
the
other
the
actions
which
were
to
the
advantage
of
society
it
termed
virtuous
and
those
which
were
not
it
called
vicious
good
and
evil
meant
nothing
more
than
that
sin
was
a
prejudice
from
which
the
free
man
should
rid
himself
society
had
three
arms
in
its
contest
with
the
individual
laws
public
opinion
and
conscience
the
first
two
could
be
met
by
guile
guile
is
the
only
weapon
of
the
weak
against
the
strong
common
opinion
put
the
matter
well
when
it
stated
that
sin
consisted
in
being
found
out
but
conscience
was
the
traitor
within
the
gates
it
fought
in
each
heart
the
battle
of
society
and
caused
the
individual
to
throw
himself
a
wanton
sacrifice
to
the
prosperity
of
his
enemy
for
it
was
clear
that
the
two
were
irreconcilable
the
state
and
the
individual
conscious
of
himself
that
uses
the
individual
for
its
own
ends
trampling
upon
him
if
he
thwarts
it
rewarding
him
with
medals
pensions
honours
when
he
serves
it
faithfully
this
strong
only
in
his
independence
threads
his
way
through
the
state
for
convenience
sake
paying
in
money
or
service
for
certain
benefits
but
with
no
sense
of
obligation
and
indifferent
to
the
rewards
asks
only
to
be
left
alone
he
is
the
independent
traveller
who
uses
cooks
tickets
because
they
save
trouble
but
looks
with
goodhumoured
contempt
on
the
personally
conducted
parties
the
free
man
can
do
no
wrong
he
does
everything
he
likesif
he
can
his
power
is
the
only
measure
of
his
morality
he
recognises
the
laws
of
the
state
and
he
can
break
them
without
sense
of
sin
but
if
he
is
punished
he
accepts
the
punishment
without
rancour
society
has
the
power
but
if
for
the
individual
there
was
no
right
and
no
wrong
then
it
seemed
to
philip
that
conscience
lost
its
power
it
was
with
a
cry
of
triumph
that
he
seized
the
knave
and
flung
him
from
his
breast
but
he
was
no
nearer
to
the
meaning
of
life
than
he
had
been
before
why
the
world
was
there
and
what
men
had
come
into
existence
for
at
all
was
as
inexplicable
as
ever
surely
there
must
be
some
reason
he
thought
of
cronshaws
parable
of
the
persian
carpet
he
offered
it
as
a
solution
of
the
riddle
and
mysteriously
he
stated
that
it
was
no
answer
at
all
unless
you
found
it
out
for
yourself
i
wonder
what
the
devil
he
meant
philip
smiled
and
so
on
the
last
day
of
september
eager
to
put
into
practice
all
these
new
theories
of
life
philip
with
sixteen
hundred
pounds
and
his
clubfoot
set
out
for
the
second
time
to
london
to
make
his
third
start
in
life
chapter
liv
the
examination
philip
had
passed
before
he
was
articled
to
a
chartered
accountant
was
sufficient
qualification
for
him
to
enter
a
medical
school
he
chose
st
lukes
because
his
father
had
been
a
student
there
and
before
the
end
of
the
summer
session
had
gone
up
to
london
for
a
day
in
order
to
see
the
secretary
he
got
a
list
of
rooms
from
him
and
took
lodgings
in
a
dingy
house
which
had
the
advantage
of
being
within
two
minutes
walk
of
the
hospital
youll
have
to
arrange
about
a
part
to
dissect
the
secretary
told
him
youd
better
start
on
a
leg
they
generally
do
they
seem
to
think
it
easier
philip
found
that
his
first
lecture
was
in
anatomy
at
eleven
and
about
half
past
ten
he
limped
across
the
road
and
a
little
nervously
made
his
way
to
the
medical
school
just
inside
the
door
a
number
of
notices
were
pinned
up
lists
of
lectures
football
fixtures
and
the
like
and
these
he
looked
at
idly
trying
to
seem
at
his
ease
young
men
and
boys
dribbled
in
and
looked
for
letters
in
the
rack
chatted
with
one
another
and
passed
downstairs
to
the
basement
in
which
was
the
students
readingroom
philip
saw
several
fellows
with
a
desultory
timid
look
dawdling
around
and
surmised
that
like
himself
they
were
there
for
the
first
time
when
he
had
exhausted
the
notices
he
saw
a
glass
door
which
led
into
what
was
apparently
a
museum
and
having
still
twenty
minutes
to
spare
he
walked
in
it
was
a
collection
of
pathological
specimens
presently
a
boy
of
about
eighteen
came
up
to
him
i
say
are
you
first
year
he
said
yes
answered
philip
wheres
the
lecture
room
dyou
know
its
getting
on
for
eleven
wed
better
try
to
find
it
they
walked
out
of
the
museum
into
a
long
dark
corridor
with
the
walls
painted
in
two
shades
of
red
and
other
youths
walking
along
suggested
the
way
to
them
they
came
to
a
door
marked
anatomy
theatre
philip
found
that
there
were
a
good
many
people
already
there
the
seats
were
arranged
in
tiers
and
just
as
philip
entered
an
attendant
came
in
put
a
glass
of
water
on
the
table
in
the
well
of
the
lectureroom
and
then
brought
in
a
pelvis
and
two
thighbones
right
and
left
more
men
entered
and
took
their
seats
and
by
eleven
the
theatre
was
fairly
full
there
were
about
sixty
students
for
the
most
part
they
were
a
good
deal
younger
than
philip
smoothfaced
boys
of
eighteen
but
there
were
a
few
who
were
older
than
he
he
noticed
one
tall
man
with
a
fierce
red
moustache
who
might
have
been
thirty
another
little
fellow
with
black
hair
only
a
year
or
two
younger
and
there
was
one
man
with
spectacles
and
a
beard
which
was
quite
gray
the
lecturer
came
in
mr
cameron
a
handsome
man
with
white
hair
and
cleancut
features
he
called
out
the
long
list
of
names
then
he
made
a
little
speech
he
spoke
in
a
pleasant
voice
with
wellchosen
words
and
he
seemed
to
take
a
discreet
pleasure
in
their
careful
arrangement
he
suggested
one
or
two
books
which
they
might
buy
and
advised
the
purchase
of
a
skeleton
he
spoke
of
anatomy
with
enthusiasm
it
was
essential
to
the
study
of
surgery
a
knowledge
of
it
added
to
the
appreciation
of
art
philip
pricked
up
his
ears
he
heard
later
that
mr
cameron
lectured
also
to
the
students
at
the
royal
academy
he
had
lived
many
years
in
japan
with
a
post
at
the
university
of
tokyo
and
he
flattered
himself
on
his
appreciation
of
the
beautiful
you
will
have
to
learn
many
tedious
things
he
finished
with
an
indulgent
smile
which
you
will
forget
the
moment
you
have
passed
your
final
examination
but
in
anatomy
it
is
better
to
have
learned
and
lost
than
never
to
have
learned
at
all
he
took
up
the
pelvis
which
was
lying
on
the
table
and
began
to
describe
it
he
spoke
well
and
clearly
at
the
end
of
the
lecture
the
boy
who
had
spoken
to
philip
in
the
pathological
museum
and
sat
next
to
him
in
the
theatre
suggested
that
they
should
go
to
the
dissectingroom
philip
and
he
walked
along
the
corridor
again
and
an
attendant
told
them
where
it
was
as
soon
as
they
entered
philip
understood
what
the
acrid
smell
was
which
he
had
noticed
in
the
passage
he
lit
a
pipe
the
attendant
gave
a
short
laugh
youll
soon
get
used
to
the
smell
i
dont
notice
it
myself
he
asked
philips
name
and
looked
at
a
list
on
the
board
youve
got
a
legnumber
four
philip
saw
that
another
name
was
bracketed
with
his
own
whats
the
meaning
of
that
he
asked
were
very
short
of
bodies
just
now
weve
had
to
put
two
on
each
part
the
dissectingroom
was
a
large
apartment
painted
like
the
corridors
the
upper
part
a
rich
salmon
and
the
dado
a
dark
terracotta
at
regular
intervals
down
the
long
sides
of
the
room
at
right
angles
with
the
wall
were
iron
slabs
grooved
like
meatdishes
and
on
each
lay
a
body
most
of
them
were
men
they
were
very
dark
from
the
preservative
in
which
they
had
been
kept
and
the
skin
had
almost
the
look
of
leather
they
were
extremely
emaciated
the
attendant
took
philip
up
to
one
of
the
slabs
a
youth
was
standing
by
it
is
your
name
carey
he
asked
yes
oh
then
weve
got
this
leg
together
its
lucky
its
a
man
isnt
it
why
asked
philip
they
generally
always
like
a
male
better
said
the
attendant
a
females
liable
to
have
a
lot
of
fat
about
her
philip
looked
at
the
body
the
arms
and
legs
were
so
thin
that
there
was
no
shape
in
them
and
the
ribs
stood
out
so
that
the
skin
over
them
was
tense
a
man
of
about
fortyfive
with
a
thin
gray
beard
and
on
his
skull
scanty
colourless
hair
the
eyes
were
closed
and
the
lower
jaw
sunken
philip
could
not
feel
that
this
had
ever
been
a
man
and
yet
in
the
row
of
them
there
was
something
terrible
and
ghastly
i
thought
id
start
at
two
said
the
young
man
who
was
dissecting
with
philip
all
right
ill
be
here
then
he
had
bought
the
day
before
the
case
of
instruments
which
was
needful
and
now
he
was
given
a
locker
he
looked
at
the
boy
who
had
accompanied
him
into
the
dissectingroom
and
saw
that
he
was
white
make
you
feel
rotten
philip
asked
him
ive
never
seen
anyone
dead
before
they
walked
along
the
corridor
till
they
came
to
the
entrance
of
the
school
philip
remembered
fanny
price
she
was
the
first
dead
person
he
had
ever
seen
and
he
remembered
how
strangely
it
had
affected
him
there
was
an
immeasurable
distance
between
the
quick
and
the
dead
they
did
not
seem
to
belong
to
the
same
species
and
it
was
strange
to
think
that
but
a
little
while
before
they
had
spoken
and
moved
and
eaten
and
laughed
there
was
something
horrible
about
the
dead
and
you
could
imagine
that
they
might
cast
an
evil
influence
on
the
living
what
dyou
say
to
having
something
to
eat
said
his
new
friend
to
philip
they
went
down
into
the
basement
where
there
was
a
dark
room
fitted
up
as
a
restaurant
and
here
the
students
were
able
to
get
the
same
sort
of
fare
as
they
might
have
at
an
aerated
bread
shop
while
they
ate
philip
had
a
scone
and
butter
and
a
cup
of
chocolate
he
discovered
that
his
companion
was
called
dunsford
he
was
a
freshcomplexioned
lad
with
pleasant
blue
eyes
and
curly
dark
hair
largelimbed
slow
of
speech
and
movement
he
had
just
come
from
clifton
are
you
taking
the
conjoint
he
asked
philip
yes
i
want
to
get
qualified
as
soon
as
i
can
im
taking
it
too
but
i
shall
take
the
f
r
c
s
afterwards
im
going
in
for
surgery
most
of
the
students
took
the
curriculum
of
the
conjoint
board
of
the
college
of
surgeons
and
the
college
of
physicians
but
the
more
ambitious
or
the
more
industrious
added
to
this
the
longer
studies
which
led
to
a
degree
from
the
university
of
london
when
philip
went
to
st
lukes
changes
had
recently
been
made
in
the
regulations
and
the
course
took
five
years
instead
of
four
as
it
had
done
for
those
who
registered
before
the
autumn
of

dunsford
was
well
up
in
his
plans
and
told
philip
the
usual
course
of
events
the
first
conjoint
examination
consisted
of
biology
anatomy
and
chemistry
but
it
could
be
taken
in
sections
and
most
fellows
took
their
biology
three
months
after
entering
the
school
this
science
had
been
recently
added
to
the
list
of
subjects
upon
which
the
student
was
obliged
to
inform
himself
but
the
amount
of
knowledge
required
was
very
small
when
philip
went
back
to
the
dissectingroom
he
was
a
few
minutes
late
since
he
had
forgotten
to
buy
the
loose
sleeves
which
they
wore
to
protect
their
shirts
and
he
found
a
number
of
men
already
working
his
partner
had
started
on
the
minute
and
was
busy
dissecting
out
cutaneous
nerves
two
others
were
engaged
on
the
second
leg
and
more
were
occupied
with
the
arms
you
dont
mind
my
having
started
thats
all
right
fire
away
said
philip
he
took
the
book
open
at
a
diagram
of
the
dissected
part
and
looked
at
what
they
had
to
find
youre
rather
a
dab
at
this
said
philip
oh
ive
done
a
good
deal
of
dissecting
before
animals
you
know
for
the
pre
sci
there
was
a
certain
amount
of
conversation
over
the
dissectingtable
partly
about
the
work
partly
about
the
prospects
of
the
football
season
the
demonstrators
and
the
lectures
philip
felt
himself
a
great
deal
older
than
the
others
they
were
raw
schoolboys
but
age
is
a
matter
of
knowledge
rather
than
of
years
and
newson
the
active
young
man
who
was
dissecting
with
him
was
very
much
at
home
with
his
subject
he
was
perhaps
not
sorry
to
show
off
and
he
explained
very
fully
to
philip
what
he
was
about
philip
notwithstanding
his
hidden
stores
of
wisdom
listened
meekly
then
philip
took
up
the
scalpel
and
the
tweezers
and
began
working
while
the
other
looked
on
ripping
to
have
him
so
thin
said
newson
wiping
his
hands
the
blighter
cant
have
had
anything
to
eat
for
a
month
i
wonder
what
he
died
of
murmured
philip
oh
i
dont
know
any
old
thing
starvation
chiefly
i
suppose
i
say
look
out
dont
cut
that
artery
its
all
very
fine
to
say
dont
cut
that
artery
remarked
one
of
the
men
working
on
the
opposite
leg
silly
old
fools
got
an
artery
in
the
wrong
place
arteries
always
are
in
the
wrong
place
said
newson
the
normals
the
one
thing
you
practically
never
get
thats
why
its
called
the
normal
dont
say
things
like
that
said
philip
or
i
shall
cut
myself
if
you
cut
yourself
answered
newson
full
of
information
wash
it
at
once
with
antiseptic
its
the
one
thing
youve
got
to
be
careful
about
there
was
a
chap
here
last
year
who
gave
himself
only
a
prick
and
he
didnt
bother
about
it
and
he
got
septicaemia
did
he
get
all
right
oh
no
he
died
in
a
week
i
went
and
had
a
look
at
him
in
the
p
m
room
philips
back
ached
by
the
time
it
was
proper
to
have
tea
and
his
luncheon
had
been
so
light
that
he
was
quite
ready
for
it
his
hands
smelt
of
that
peculiar
odour
which
he
had
first
noticed
that
morning
in
the
corridor
he
thought
his
muffin
tasted
of
it
too
oh
youll
get
used
to
that
said
newson
when
you
dont
have
the
good
old
dissectingroom
stink
about
you
feel
quite
lonely
im
not
going
to
let
it
spoil
my
appetite
said
philip
as
he
followed
up
the
muffin
with
a
piece
of
cake

lv
philips
ideas
of
the
life
of
medical
students
like
those
of
the
public
at
large
were
founded
on
the
pictures
which
charles
dickens
drew
in
the
middle
of
the
nineteenth
century
he
soon
discovered
that
bob
sawyer
if
he
ever
existed
was
no
longer
at
all
like
the
medical
student
of
the
present
it
is
a
mixed
lot
which
enters
upon
the
medical
profession
and
naturally
there
are
some
who
are
lazy
and
reckless
they
think
it
is
an
easy
life
idle
away
a
couple
of
years
and
then
because
their
funds
come
to
an
end
or
because
angry
parents
refuse
any
longer
to
support
them
drift
away
from
the
hospital
others
find
the
examinations
too
hard
for
them
one
failure
after
another
robs
them
of
their
nerve
and
panicstricken
they
forget
as
soon
as
they
come
into
the
forbidding
buildings
of
the
conjoint
board
the
knowledge
which
before
they
had
so
pat
they
remain
year
after
year
objects
of
goodhumoured
scorn
to
younger
men
some
of
them
crawl
through
the
examination
of
the
apothecaries
hall
others
become
nonqualified
assistants
a
precarious
position
in
which
they
are
at
the
mercy
of
their
employer
their
lot
is
poverty
drunkenness
and
heaven
only
knows
their
end
but
for
the
most
part
medical
students
are
industrious
young
men
of
the
middleclass
with
a
sufficient
allowance
to
live
in
the
respectable
fashion
they
have
been
used
to
many
are
the
sons
of
doctors
who
have
already
something
of
the
professional
manner
their
career
is
mapped
out
as
soon
as
they
are
qualified
they
propose
to
apply
for
a
hospital
appointment
after
holding
which
and
perhaps
a
trip
to
the
far
east
as
a
ships
doctor
they
will
join
their
father
and
spend
the
rest
of
their
days
in

one

out
as

brilliant
they
will
take

and
scholarships
which
are
open

at

go
on
the
staff
take
a
consultingroom
in
harley
street
and
specialising
in
one
subject
or
another
become
prosperous
eminent
and
titled
the
medical
profession
is
the
only
one
which
a
man
may
enter
at
any
age
with
some
chance
of
making
a
living
among
the
men
of
philips
year
were
three
or
four
who
were
past
their
first
youth
one
had
been
in
the
navy
from
which
according
to
report
he
had
been
dismissed
for
drunkenness
he
was
a
man
of
thirty
with
a
red
face
a
brusque
manner
and
a
loud
voice
another
was
a
married
man
with
two
children
who
had
lost
money
through
a
defaulting
solicitor
he
had
a
bowed
look
as
if
the
world
were
too
much
for
him
he
went
about
his
work
silently
and
it
was
plain
that
he
found
it
difficult
at
his
age
to
commit
facts
to
memory
his
mind
worked
slowly
his
effort
at
application
was
painful
to
see
philip
made
himself
at
home
in
his
tiny
rooms
he
arranged
his
books
and
hung
on
the
walls
such
pictures
and
sketches
as
he
possessed
above
him
on
the
drawingroom
floor
lived
a
fifthyear
man
called
griffiths
but
philip
saw
little
of
him
partly
because
he
was
occupied
chiefly
in
the
wards
and
partly
because
he
had
been
to
oxford
such
of
the
students
as
had
been
to
a
university
kept
a
good
deal
together
they
used
a
variety
of
means
natural
to
the
young
in
order
to
impress
upon
the
less
fortunate
a
proper
sense
of
their
inferiority
the
rest
of
the
students
found
their
olympian
serenity
rather
hard
to
bear
griffiths
was
a
tall
fellow
with
a
quantity
of
curly
red
hair
and
blue
eyes
a
white
skin
and
a
very
red
mouth
he
was
one
of
those
fortunate
people
whom
everybody
liked
for
he
had
high
spirits
and
a
constant
gaiety
he
strummed
a
little
on
the
piano
and
sang
comic
songs
with
gusto
and
evening
after
evening
while
philip
was
reading
in
his
solitary
room
he
heard
the
shouts
and
the
uproarious
laughter
of
griffiths
friends
above
him
he
thought
of
those
delightful
evenings
in
paris
when
they
would
sit
in
the
studio
lawson
and
he
flanagan
and
clutton
and
talk
of
art
and
morals
the
loveaffairs
of
the
present
and
the
fame
of
the
future
he
felt
sick
at
heart
he
found
that
it
was
easy
to
make
a
heroic
gesture
but
hard
to
abide
by
its
results
the
worst
of
it
was
that
the
work
seemed
to
him
very
tedious
he
had
got
out
of
the
habit
of
being
asked
questions
by
demonstrators
his
attention
wandered
at
lectures
anatomy
was
a
dreary
science
a
mere
matter
of
learning
by
heart
an
enormous
number
of
facts
dissection
bored
him
he
did
not
see
the
use
of
dissecting
out
laboriously
nerves
and
arteries
when
with
much
less
trouble
you
could
see
in
the
diagrams
of
a
book
or
in
the
specimens
of
the
pathological
museum
exactly
where
they
were
he
made
friends
by
chance
but
not
intimate
friends
for
he
seemed
to
have
nothing
in
particular
to
say
to
his
companions
when
he
tried
to
interest
himself
in
their
concerns
he
felt
that
they
found
him
patronising
he
was
not
of
those
who
can
talk
of
what
moves
them
without
caring
whether
it
bores
or
not
the
people
they
talk
to
one
man
hearing
that
he
had
studied
art
in
paris
and
fancying
himself
on
his
taste
tried
to
discuss
art
with
him
but
philip
was
impatient
of
views
which
did
not
agree
with
his
own
and
finding
quickly
that
the
others
ideas
were
conventional
grew
monosyllabic
philip
desired
popularity
but
could
bring
himself
to
make
no
advances
to
others
a
fear
of
rebuff
prevented
him
from
affability
and
he
concealed
his
shyness
which
was
still
intense
under
a
frigid
taciturnity
he
was
going
through
the
same
experience
as
he
had
done
at
school
but
here
the
freedom
of
the
medical
students
life
made
it
possible
for
him
to
live
a
good
deal
by
himself
it
was
through
no
effort
of
his
that
he
became
friendly
with
dunsford
the
freshcomplexioned
heavy
lad
whose
acquaintance
he
had
made
at
the
beginning
of
the
session
dunsford
attached
himself
to
philip
merely
because
he
was
the
first
person
he
had
known
at
st
lukes
he
had
no
friends
in
london
and
on
saturday
nights
he
and
philip
got
into
the
habit
of
going
together
to
the
pit
of
a
musichall
or
the
gallery
of
a
theatre
he
was
stupid
but
he
was
goodhumoured
and
never
took
offence
he
always
said
the
obvious
thing
but
when
philip
laughed
at
him
merely
smiled
he
had
a
very
sweet
smile
though
philip
made
him
his
butt
he
liked
him
he
was
amused
by
his
candour
and
delighted
with
his
agreeable
nature
dunsford
had
the
charm
which
himself
was
acutely
conscious
of
not
possessing
they
often
went
to
have
tea
at
a
shop
in
parliament
street
because
dunsford
admired
one
of
the
young
women
who
waited
philip
did
not
find
anything
attractive
in
her
she
was
tall
and
thin
with
narrow
hips
and
the
chest
of
a
boy
no
one
would
look
at
her
in
paris
said
philip
scornfully
shes
got
a
ripping
face
said
dunsford
what
does
the
face
matter
she
had
the
small
regular
features
the
blue
eyes
and
the
broad
low
brow
which
the
victorian
painters
lord
leighton
alma
tadema
and
a
hundred
others
induced
the
world
they
lived
in
to
accept
as
a
type
of
greek
beauty
she
seemed
to
have
a
great
deal
of
hair
it
was
arranged
with
peculiar
elaboration
and
done
over
the
forehead
in
what
she
called
an
alexandra
fringe
she
was
very
anaemic
her
thin
lips
were
pale
and
her
skin
was
delicate
of
a
faint
green
colour
without
a
touch
of
red
even
in
the
cheeks
she
had
very
good
teeth
she
took
great
pains
to
prevent
her
work
from
spoiling
her
hands
and
they
were
small
thin
and
white
she
went
about
her
duties
with
a
bored
look
dunsford
very
shy
with
women
had
never
succeeded
in
getting
into
conversation
with
her
and
he
urged
philip
to
help
him
all
i
want
is
a
lead
he
said
and
then
i
can
manage
for
myself
philip
to
please
him
made
one
or
two
remarks
but
she
answered
with
monosyllables
she
had
taken
their
measure
they
were
boys
and
she
surmised
they
were
students
she
had
no
use
for
them
dunsford
noticed
that
a
man
with
sandy
hair
and
a
bristly
moustache
who
looked
like
a
german
was
favoured
with
her
attention
whenever
he
came
into
the
shop
and
then
it
was
only
by
calling
her
two
or
three
times
that
they
could
induce
her
to
take
their
order
she
used
the
clients
whom
she
did
not
know
with
frigid
insolence
and
when
she
was
talking
to
a
friend
was
perfectly
indifferent
to
the
calls
of
the
hurried
she
had
the
art
of
treating
women
who
desired
refreshment
with
just
that
degree
of
impertinence
which
irritated
them
without
affording
them
an
opportunity
of
complaining
to
the
management
one
day
dunsford
told
him
her
name
was
mildred
he
had
heard
one
of
the
other
girls
in
the
shop
address
her
what
an
odious
name
said
philip
why
asked
dunsford
i
like
it
its
so
pretentious
it
chanced
that
on
this
day
the
german
was
not
there
and
when
she
brought
the
tea
philip
smiling
remarked
your
friends
not
here
today
i
dont
know
what
you
mean
she
said
coldly
i
was
referring
to
the
nobleman
with
the
sandy
moustache
has
he
left
you
for
another
some
people
would
do
better
to
mind
their
own
business
she
retorted
she
left
them
and
since
for
a
minute
or
two
there
was
no
one
to
attend
to
sat
down
and
looked
at
the
evening
paper
which
a
customer
had
left
behind
him
you
are
a
fool
to
put
her
back
up
said
dunsford
im
really
quite
indifferent
to
the
attitude
of
her
vertebrae
replied
philip
but
he
was
piqued
it
irritated
him
that
when
he
tried
to
be
agreeable
with
a
woman
she
should
take
offence
when
he
asked
for
the
bill
he
hazarded
a
remark
which
he
meant
to
lead
further
are
we
no
longer
on
speaking
terms
he
smiled
im
here
to
take
orders
and
to
wait
on
customers
ive
got
nothing
to
say
to
them
and
i
dont
want
them
to
say
anything
to
me
she
put
down
the
slip
of
paper
on
which
she
had
marked
the
sum
they
had
to
pay
and
walked
back
to
the
table
at
which
she
had
been
sitting
philip
flushed
with
anger
thats
one
in
the
eye
for
you
carey
said
dunsford
when
they
got
outside
illmannered
slut
said
philip
i
shant
go
there
again
his
influence
with
dunsford
was
strong
enough
to
get
him
to
take
their
tea
elsewhere
and
dunsford
soon
found
another
young
woman
to
flirt
with
but
the
snub
which
the
waitress
had
inflicted
on
him
rankled
if
she
had
treated
him
with
civility
he
would
have
been
perfectly
indifferent
to
her
but
it
was
obvious
that
she
disliked
him
rather
than
otherwise
and
his
pride
was
wounded
he
could
not
suppress
a
desire
to
be
even
with
her
he
was
impatient
with
himself
because
he
had
so
petty
a
feeling
but
three
or
four
days
firmness
during
which
he
would
not
go
to
the
shop
did
not
help
him
to
surmount
it
and
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
it
would
be
least
trouble
to
see
her
having
done
so
he
would
certainly
cease
to
think
of
her
pretexting
an
appointment
one
afternoon
for
he
was
not
a
little
ashamed
of
his
weakness
he
left
dunsford
and
went
straight
to
the
shop
which
he
had
vowed
never
again
to
enter
he
saw
the
waitress
the
moment
he
came
in
and
sat
down
at
one
of
her
tables
he
expected
her
to
make
some
reference
to
the
fact
that
he
had
not
been
there
for
a
week
but
when
she
came
up
for
his
order
she
said
nothing
he
had
heard
her
say
to
other
customers
youre
quite
a
stranger
she
gave
no
sign
that
she
had
ever
seen
him
before
in
order
to
see
whether
she
had
really
forgotten
him
when
she
brought
his
tea
he
asked
have
you
seen
my
friend
tonight
no
hes
not
been
in
here
for
some
days
he
wanted
to
use
this
as
the
beginning
of
a
conversation
but
he
was
strangely
nervous
and
could
think
of
nothing
to
say
she
gave
him
no
opportunity
but
at
once
went
away
he
had
no
chance
of
saying
anything
till
he
asked
for
his
bill
filthy
weather
isnt
it
he
said
it
was
mortifying
that
he
had
been
forced
to
prepare
such
a
phrase
as
that
he
could
not
make
out
why
she
filled
him
with
such
embarrassment
it
dont
make
much
difference
to
me
what
the
weather
is
having
to
be
in
here
all
day
there
was
an
insolence
in
her
tone
that
peculiarly
irritated
him
a
sarcasm
rose
to
his
lips
but
he
forced
himself
to
be
silent
i
wish
to
god
shed
say
something
really
cheeky
he
raged
to
himself
so
that
i
could
report
her
and
get
her
sacked
it
would
serve
her
damned
well
right
chapter
lvi
he
could
not
get
her
out
of
his
mind
he
laughed
angrily
at
his
own
foolishness
it
was
absurd
to
care
what
an
anaemic
little
waitress
said
to
him
but
he
was
strangely
humiliated
though
no
one
knew
of
the
humiliation
but
dunsford
and
he
had
certainly
forgotten
philip
felt
that
he
could
have
no
peace
till
he
had
wiped
it
out
he
thought
over
what
he
had
better
do
he
made
up
his
mind
that
he
would
go
to
the
shop
every
day
it
was
obvious
that
he
had
made
a
disagreeable
impression
on
her
but
he
thought
he
had
the
wits
to
eradicate
it
he
would
take
care
not
to
say
anything
at
which
the
most
susceptible
person
could
be
offended
all
this
he
did
but
it
had
no
effect
when
he
went
in
and
said
goodevening
she
answered
with
the
same
words
but
when
once
he
omitted
to
say
it
in
order
to
see
whether
she
would
say
it
first
she
said
nothing
at
all
he
murmured
in
his
heart
an
expression
which
though
frequently
applicable
to
members
of
the
female
sex
is
not
often
used
of
them
in
polite
society
but
with
an
unmoved
face
he
ordered
his
tea
he
made
up
his
mind
not
to
speak
a
word
and
left
the
shop
without
his
usual
goodnight
he
promised
himself
that
he
would
not
go
any
more
but
the
next
day
at
teatime
he
grew
restless
he
tried
to
think
of
other
things
but
he
had
no
command
over
his
thoughts
at
last
he
said
desperately
after
all
theres
no
reason
why
i
shouldnt
go
if
i
want
to
the
struggle
with
himself
had
taken
a
long
time
and
it
was
getting
on
for
seven
when
he
entered
the
shop
i
thought
you
werent
coming
the
girl
said
to
him
when
he
sat
down
his
heart
leaped
in
his
bosom
and
he
felt
himself
reddening
i
was
detained
i
couldnt
come
before
cutting
up
people
i
suppose
not
so
bad
as
that
you
are
a
stoodent
arent
you
yes
but
that
seemed
to
satisfy
her
curiosity
she
went
away
and
since
at
that
late
hour
there
was
nobody
else
at
her
tables
she
immersed
herself
in
a
novelette
this
was
before
the
time
of
the
sixpenny
reprints
there
was
a
regular
supply
of
inexpensive
fiction
written
to
order
by
poor
hacks
for
the
consumption
of
the
illiterate
philip
was
elated
she
had
addressed
him
of
her
own
accord
he
saw
the
time
approaching
when
his
turn
would
come
and
he
would
tell
her
exactly
what
he
thought
of
her
it
would
be
a
great
comfort
to
express
the
immensity
of
his
contempt
he
looked
at
her
it
was
true
that
her
profile
was
beautiful
it
was
extraordinary
how
english
girls
of
that
class
had
so
often
a
perfection
of
outline
which
took
your
breath
away
but
it
was
as
cold
as
marble
and
the
faint
green
of
her
delicate
skin
gave
an
impression
of
unhealthiness
all
the
waitresses
were
dressed
alike
in
plain
black
dresses
with
a
white
apron
cuffs
and
a
small
cap
on
a
half
sheet
of
paper
that
he
had
in
his
pocket
philip
made
a
sketch
of
her
as
she
sat
leaning
over
her
book
she
outlined
the
words
with
her
lips
as
she
read
and
left
it
on
the
table
when
he
went
away
it
was
an
inspiration
for
next
day
when
he
came
in
she
smiled
at
him
i
didnt
know
you
could
draw
she
said
i
was
an
artstudent
in
paris
for
two
years
i
showed
that
drawing
you
left
beind
you
last
night
to
the
manageress
and
she
was
struck
with
it
was
it
meant
to
be
me
it
was
said
philip
when
she
went
for
his
tea
one
of
the
other
girls
came
up
to
him
i
saw
that
picture
you
done
of
miss
rogers
it
was
the
very
image
of
her
she
said
that
was
the
first
time
he
had
heard
her
name
and
when
he
wanted
his
bill
he
called
her
by
it
i
see
you
know
my
name
she
said
when
she
came
your
friend
mentioned
it
when
she
said
something
to
me
about
that
drawing
she
wants
you
to
do
one
of
her
dont
you
do
it
if
you
once
begin
youll
have
to
go
on
and
theyll
all
be
wanting
you
to
do
them
then
without
a
pause
with
peculiar
inconsequence
she
said
wheres
that
young
fellow
that
used
to
come
with
you
has
he
gone
away
fancy
your
remembering
him
said
philip
he
was
a
nicelooking
young
fellow
philip
felt
quite
a
peculiar
sensation
in
his
heart
he
did
not
know
what
it
was
dunsford
had
jolly
curling
hair
a
fresh
complexion
and
a
beautiful
smile
philip
thought
of
these
advantages
with
envy
oh
hes
in
love
said
he
with
a
little
laugh
philip
repeated
every
word
of
the
conversation
to
himself
as
he
limped
home
she
was
quite
friendly
with
him
now
when
opportunity
arose
he
would
offer
to
make
a
more
finished
sketch
of
her
he
was
sure
she
would
like
that
her
face
was
interesting
the
profile
was
lovely
and
there
was
something
curiously
fascinating
about
the
chlorotic
colour
he
tried
to
think
what
it
was
like
at
first
he
thought
of
pea
soup
but
driving
away
that
idea
angrily
he
thought
of
the
petals
of
a
yellow
rosebud
when
you
tore
it
to
pieces
before
it
had
burst
he
had
no
illfeeling
towards
her
now
shes
not
a
bad
sort
he
murmured
it
was
silly
of
him
to
take
offence
at
what
she
had
said
it
was
doubtless
his
own
fault
she
had
not
meant
to
make
herself
disagreeable
he
ought
to
be
accustomed
by
now
to
making
at
first
sight
a
bad
impression
on
people
he
was
flattered
at
the
success
of
his
drawing
she
looked
upon
him
with
more
interest
now
that
she
was
aware
of
this
small
talent
he
was
restless
next
day
he
thought
of
going
to
lunch
at
the
teashop
but
he
was
certain
there
would
be
many
people
there
then
and
mildred
would
not
be
able
to
talk
to
him
he
had
managed
before
this
to
get
out
of
having
tea
with
dunsford
and
punctually
at
half
past
four
he
had
looked
at
his
watch
a
dozen
times
he
went
into
the
shop
mildred
had
her
back
turned
to
him
she
was
sitting
down
talking
to
the
german
whom
philip
had
seen
there
every
day
till
a
fortnight
ago
and
since
then
had
not
seen
at
all
she
was
laughing
at
what
he
said
philip
thought
she
had
a
common
laugh
and
it
made
him
shudder
he
called
her
but
she
took
no
notice
he
called
her
again
then
growing
angry
for
he
was
impatient
he
rapped
the
table
loudly
with
his
stick
she
approached
sulkily
how
dyou
do
he
said
you
seem
to
be
in
a
great
hurry
she
looked
down
at
him
with
the
insolent
manner
which
he
knew
so
well
i
say
whats
the
matter
with
you
he
asked
if
youll
kindly
give
your
order
ill
get
what
you
want
i
cant
stand
talking
all
night
tea
and
toasted
bun
please
philip
answered
briefly
he
was
furious
with
her
he
had
the
star
with
him
and
read
it
elaborately
when
she
brought
the
tea
if
youll
give
me
my
bill
now
i
neednt
trouble
you
again
he
said
icily
she
wrote
out
the
slip
placed
it
on
the
table
and
went
back
to
the
german
soon
she
was
talking
to
him
with
animation
he
was
a
man
of
middle
height
with
the
round
head
of
his
nation
and
a
sallow
face
his
moustache
was
large
and
bristling
he
had
on
a
tailcoat
and
gray
trousers
and
he
wore
a
massive
gold
watchchain
philip
thought
the
other
girls
looked
from
him
to
the
pair
at
the
table
and
exchanged
significant
glances
he
felt
certain
they
were
laughing
at
him
and
his
blood
boiled
he
detested
mildred
now
with
all
his
heart
he
knew
that
the
best
thing
he
could
do
was
to
cease
coming
to
the
teashop
but
he
could
not
bear
to
think
that
he
had
been
worsted
in
the
affair
and
he
devised
a
plan
to
show
her
that
he
despised
her
next
day
he
sat
down
at
another
table
and
ordered
his
tea
from
another
waitress
mildreds
friend
was
there
again
and
she
was
talking
to
him
she
paid
no
attention
to
philip
and
so
when
he
went
out
he
chose
a
moment
when
she
had
to
cross
his
path
as
he
passed
he
looked
at
her
as
though
he
had
never
seen
her
before
he
repeated
this
for
three
or
four
days
he
expected
that
presently
she
would
take
the
opportunity
to
say
something
to
him
he
thought
she
would
ask
why
he
never
came
to
one
of
her
tables
now
and
he
had
prepared
an
answer
charged
with
all
the
loathing
he
felt
for
her
he
knew
it
was
absurd
to
trouble
but
he
could
not
help
himself
she
had
beaten
him
again
the
german
suddenly
disappeared
but
philip
still
sat
at
other
tables
she
paid
no
attention
to
him
suddenly
he
realised
that
what
he
did
was
a
matter
of
complete
indifference
to
her
he
could
go
on
in
that
way
till
doomsday
and
it
would
have
no
effect
ive
not
finished
yet
he
said
to
himself
the
day
after
he
sat
down
in
his
old
seat
and
when
she
came
up
said
goodevening
as
though
he
had
not
ignored
her
for
a
week
his
face
was
placid
but
he
could
not
prevent
the
mad
beating
of
his
heart
at
that
time
the
musical
comedy
had
lately
leaped
into
public
favour
and
he
was
sure
that
mildred
would
be
delighted
to
go
to
one
i
say
he
said
suddenly
i
wonder
if
youd
dine
with
me
one
night
and
come
to
the
belle
of
new
york
ill
get
a
couple
of
stalls
he
added
the
last
sentence
in
order
to
tempt
her
he
knew
that
when
the
girls
went
to
the
play
it
was
either
in
the
pit
or
if
some
man
took
them
seldom
to
more
expensive
seats
than
the
upper
circle
mildreds
pale
face
showed
no
change
of
expression
i
dont
mind
she
said
when
will
you
come
i
get
off
early
on
thursdays
they
made
arrangements
mildred
lived
with
an
aunt
at
herne
hill
the
play
began
at
eight
so
they
must
dine
at
seven
she
proposed
that
he
should
meet
her
in
the
secondclass
waitingroom
at
victoria
station
she
showed
no
pleasure
but
accepted
the
invitation
as
though
she
conferred
a
favour
philip
was
vaguely
irritated
chapter
lvii
philip
arrived
at
victoria
station
nearly
half
an
hour
before
the
time
which
mildred
had
appointed
and
sat
down
in
the
secondclass
waitingroom
he
waited
and
she
did
not
come
he
began
to
grow
anxious
and
walked
into
the
station
watching
the
incoming
suburban
trains
the
hour
which
she
had
fixed
passed
and
still
there
was
no
sign
of
her
philip
was
impatient
he
went
into
the
other
waitingrooms
and
looked
at
the
people
sitting
in
them
suddenly
his
heart
gave
a
great
thud
there
you
are
i
thought
you
were
never
coming
i
like
that
after
keeping
me
waiting
all
this
time
i
had
half
a
mind
to
go
back
home
again
but
you
said
youd
come
to
the
secondclass
waitingroom
i
didnt
say
any
such
thing
it
isnt
exactly
likely
id
sit
in
the
secondclass
room
when
i
could
sit
in
the
first
is
it
though
philip
was
sure
he
had
not
made
a
mistake
he
said
nothing
and
they
got
into
a
cab
where
are
we
dining
she
asked
i
thought
of
the
adelphi
restaurant
will
that
suit
you
i
dont
mind
where
we
dine
she
spoke
ungraciously
she
was
put
out
by
being
kept
waiting
and
answered
philips
attempt
at
conversation
with
monosyllables
she
wore
a
long
cloak
of
some
rough
dark
material
and
a
crochet
shawl
over
her
head
they
reached
the
restaurant
and
sat
down
at
a
table
she
looked
round
with
satisfaction
the
red
shades
to
the
candles
on
the
tables
the
gold
of
the
decorations
the
lookingglasses
lent
the
room
a
sumptuous
air
ive
never
been
here
before
she
gave
philip
a
smile
she
had
taken
off
her
cloak
and
he
saw
that
she
wore
a
pale
blue
dress
cut
square
at
the
neck
and
her
hair
was
more
elaborately
arranged
than
ever
he
had
ordered
champagne
and
when
it
came
her
eyes
sparkled
you
are
going
it
she
said
because
ive
ordered
fiz
he
asked
carelessly
as
though
he
never
drank
anything
else
i
was
surprised
when
you
asked
me
to
do
a
theatre
with
you
conversation
did
not
go
very
easily
for
she
did
not
seem
to
have
much
to
say
and
philip
was
nervously
conscious
that
he
was
not
amusing
her
she
listened
carelessly
to
his
remarks
with
her
eyes
on
other
diners
and
made
no
pretence
that
she
was
interested
in
him
he
made
one
or
two
little
jokes
but
she
took
them
quite
seriously
the
only
sign
of
vivacity
he
got
was
when
he
spoke
of
the
other
girls
in
the
shop
she
could
not
bear
the
manageress
and
told
him
all
her
misdeeds
at
length
i
cant
stick
her
at
any
price
and
all
the
air
she
gives
herself
sometimes
ive
got
more
than
half
a
mind
to
tell
her
something
she
doesnt
think
i
know
anything
about
what
is
that
asked
philip
well
i
happen
to
know
that
shes
not
above
going
to
eastbourne
with
a
man
for
the
weekend
now
and
again
one
of
the
girls
has
a
married
sister
who
goes
there
with
her
husband
and
shes
seen
her
she
was
staying
at
the
same
boardinghouse
and
she
ad
a
weddingring
on
and
i
know
for
one
shes
not
married
philip
filled
her
glass
hoping
that
champagne
would
make
her
more
affable
he
was
anxious
that
his
little
jaunt
should
be
a
success
he
noticed
that
she
held
her
knife
as
though
it
were
a
penholder
and
when
she
drank
protruded
her
little
finger
he
started
several
topics
of
conversation
but
he
could
get
little
out
of
her
and
he
remembered
with
irritation
that
he
had
seen
her
talking
nineteen
to
the
dozen
and
laughing
with
the
german
they
finished
dinner
and
went
to
the
play
philip
was
a
very
cultured
young
man
and
he
looked
upon
musical
comedy
with
scorn
he
thought
the
jokes
vulgar
and
the
melodies
obvious
it
seemed
to
him
that
they
did
these
things
much
better
in
france
but
mildred
enjoyed
herself
thoroughly
she
laughed
till
her
sides
ached
looking
at
philip
now
and
then
when
something
tickled
her
to
exchange
a
glance
of
pleasure
and
she
applauded
rapturously
this
is
the
seventh
time
ive
been
she
said
after
the
first
act
and
i
dont
mind
if
i
come
seven
times
more
she
was
much
interested
in
the
women
who
surrounded
them
in
the
stalls
she
pointed
out
to
philip
those
who
were
painted
and
those
who
wore
false
hair
it
is
horrible
these
westend
people
she
said
i
dont
know
how
they
can
do
it
she
put
her
hand
to
her
hair
mines
all
my
own
every
bit
of
it
she
found
no
one
to
admire
and
whenever
she
spoke
of
anyone
it
was
to
say
something
disagreeable
it
made
philip
uneasy
he
supposed
that
next
day
she
would
tell
the
girls
in
the
shop
that
he
had
taken
her
out
and
that
he
had
bored
her
to
death
he
disliked
her
and
yet
he
knew
not
why
he
wanted
to
be
with
her
on
the
way
home
he
asked
i
hope
youve
enjoyed
yourself
rather
will
you
come
out
with
me
again
one
evening
i
dont
mind
he
could
never
get
beyond
such
expressions
as
that
her
indifference
maddened
him
that
sounds
as
if
you
didnt
much
care
if
you
came
or
not
oh
if
you
dont
take
me
out
some
other
fellow
will
i
need
never
want
for
men
wholl
take
me
to
the
theatre
philip
was
silent
they
came
to
the
station
and
he
went
to
the
bookingoffice
ive
got
my
season
she
said
i
thought
id
take
you
home
as
its
rather
late
if
you
dont
mind
oh
i
dont
mind
if
it
gives
you
any
pleasure
he
took
a
single
first
for
her
and
a
return
for
himself
well
youre
not
mean
i
will
say
that
for
you
she
said
when
he
opened
the
carriagedoor
philip
did
not
know
whether
he
was
pleased
or
sorry
when
other
people
entered
and
it
was
impossible
to
speak
they
got
out
at
herne
hill
and
he
accompanied
her
to
the
corner
of
the
road
in
which
she
lived
ill
say
goodnight
to
you
here
she
said
holding
out
her
hand
youd
better
not
come
up
to
the
door
i
know
what
people
are
and
i
dont
want
to
have
anybody
talking
she
said
goodnight
and
walked
quickly
away
he
could
see
the
white
shawl
in
the
darkness
he
thought
she
might
turn
round
but
she
did
not
philip
saw
which
house
she
went
into
and
in
a
moment
he
walked
along
to
look
at
it
it
was
a
trim
common
little
house
of
yellow
brick
exactly
like
all
the
other
little
houses
in
the
street
he
stood
outside
for
a
few
minutes
and
presently
the
window
on
the
top
floor
was
darkened
philip
strolled
slowly
back
to
the
station
the
evening
had
been
unsatisfactory
he
felt
irritated
restless
and
miserable
when
he
lay
in
bed
he
seemed
still
to
see
her
sitting
in
the
corner
of
the
railway
carriage
with
the
white
crochet
shawl
over
her
head
he
did
not
know
how
he
was
to
get
through
the
hours
that
must
pass
before
his
eyes
rested
on
her
again
he
thought
drowsily
of
her
thin
face
with
its
delicate
features
and
the
greenish
pallor
of
her
skin
he
was
not
happy
with
her
but
he
was
unhappy
away
from
her
he
wanted
to
sit
by
her
side
and
look
at
her
he
wanted
to
touch
her
he
wanted
the
thought
came
to
him
and
he
did
not
finish
it
suddenly
he
grew
wide
awake
he
wanted
to
kiss
the
thin
pale
mouth
with
its
narrow
lips
the
truth
came
to
him
at
last
he
was
in
love
with
her
it
was
incredible
he
had
often
thought
of
falling
in
love
and
there
was
one
scene
which
he
had
pictured
to
himself
over
and
over
again
he
saw
himself
coming
into
a
ballroom
his
eyes
fell
on
a
little
group
of
men
and
women
talking
and
one
of
the
women
turned
round
her
eyes
fell
upon
him
and
he
knew
that
the
gasp
in
his
throat
was
in
her
throat
too
he
stood
quite
still
she
was
tall
and
dark
and
beautiful
with
eyes
like
the
night
she
was
dressed
in
white
and
in
her
black
hair
shone
diamonds
they
stared
at
one
another
forgetting
that
people
surrounded
them
he
went
straight
up
to
her
and
she
moved
a
little
towards
him
both
felt
that
the
formality
of
introduction
was
out
of
place
he
spoke
to
her
ive
been
looking
for
you
all
my
life
he
said
youve
come
at
last
she
murmured
will
you
dance
with
me
she
surrendered
herself
to
his
outstretched
hands
and
they
danced
philip
always
pretended
that
he
was
not
lame
she
danced
divinely
ive
never
danced
with
anyone
who
danced
like
you
she
said
she
tore
up
her
programme
and
they
danced
together
the
whole
evening
im
so
thankful
that
i
waited
for
you
he
said
to
her
i
knew
that
in
the
end
i
must
meet
you
people
in
the
ballroom
stared
they
did
not
care
they
did
not
wish
to
hide
their
passion
at
last
they
went
into
the
garden
he
flung
a
light
cloak
over
her
shoulders
and
put
her
in
a
waiting
cab
they
caught
the
midnight
train
to
paris
and
they
sped
through
the
silent
starlit
night
into
the
unknown
he
thought
of
this
old
fancy
of
his
and
it
seemed
impossible
that
he
should
be
in
love
with
mildred
rogers
her
name
was
grotesque
he
did
not
think
her
pretty
he
hated
the
thinness
of
her
only
that
evening
he
had
noticed
how
the
bones
of
her
chest
stood
out
in
eveningdress
he
went
over
her
features
one
by
one
he
did
not
like
her
mouth
and
the
unhealthiness
of
her
colour
vaguely
repelled
him
she
was
common
her
phrases
so
bald
and
few
constantly
repeated
showed
the
emptiness
of
her
mind
he
recalled
her
vulgar
little
laugh
at
the
jokes
of
the
musical
comedy
and
he
remembered
the
little
finger
carefully
extended
when
she
held
her
glass
to
her
mouth
her
manners
like
her
conversation
were
odiously
genteel
he
remembered
her
insolence
sometimes
he
had
felt
inclined
to
box
her
ears
and
suddenly
he
knew
not
why
perhaps
it
was
the
thought
of
hitting
her
or
the
recollection
of
her
tiny
beautiful
ears
he
was
seized
by
an
uprush
of
emotion
he
yearned
for
her
he
thought
of
taking
her
in
his
arms
the
thin
fragile
body
and
kissing
her
pale
mouth
he
wanted
to
pass
his
fingers
down
the
slightly
greenish
cheeks
he
wanted
her
he
had
thought
of
love
as
a
rapture
which
seized
one
so
that
all
the
world
seemed
springlike
he
had
looked
forward
to
an
ecstatic
happiness
but
this
was
not
happiness
it
was
a
hunger
of
the
soul
it
was
a
painful
yearning
it
was
a
bitter
anguish
he
had
never
known
before
he
tried
to
think
when
it
had
first
come
to
him
he
did
not
know
he
only
remembered
that
each
time
he
had
gone
into
the
shop
after
the
first
two
or
three
times
it
had
been
with
a
little
feeling
in
the
heart
that
was
pain
and
he
remembered
that
when
she
spoke
to
him
he
felt
curiously
breathless
when
she
left
him
it
was
wretchedness
and
when
she
came
to
him
again
it
was
despair
he
stretched
himself
in
his
bed
as
a
dog
stretches
himself
he
wondered
how
he
was
going
to
endure
that
ceaseless
aching
of
his
soul
chapter
lviii
philip
woke
early
next
morning
and
his
first
thought
was
of
mildred
it
struck
him
that
he
might
meet
her
at
victoria
station
and
walk
with
her
to
the
shop
he
shaved
quickly
scrambled
into
his
clothes
and
took
a
bus
to
the
station
he
was
there
by
twenty
to
eight
aud
watched
the
incoming
trains
crowds
poured
out
of
them
clerks
and
shoppeople
at
that
early
hour
and
thronged
up
the
platform
they
hurried
along
sometimes
in
pairs
here
and
there
a
group
of
girls
but
more
often
alone
they
were
white
most
of
them
ugly
in
the
early
morning
and
they
had
an
abstracted
look
the
younger
ones
walked
lightly
as
though
the
cement
of
the
platform
were
pleasant
to
tread
but
the
others
went
as
though
impelled
by
a
machine
their
faces
were
set
in
an
anxious
frown
at
last
philip
saw
mildred
and
he
went
up
to
her
eagerly
goodmorning
he
said
i
thought
id
come
and
see
how
you
were
after
last
night
she
wore
an
old
brown
ulster
and
a
sailor
hat
it
was
very
clear
that
she
was
not
pleased
to
see
him
oh
im
all
right
i
havent
got
much
time
to
waste
dyou
mind
if
i
walk
down
victoria
street
with
you
im
none
too
early
i
shall
have
to
walk
fast
she
answered
looking
down
at
philips
clubfoot
he
turned
scarlet
i
beg
your
pardon
i
wont
detain
you
you
can
please
yourself
she
went
on
and
he
with
a
sinking
heart
made
his
way
home
to
breakfast
he
hated
her
he
knew
he
was
a
fool
to
bother
about
her
she
was
not
the
sort
of
woman
who
would
ever
care
two
straws
for
him
and
she
must
look
upon
his
deformity
with
distaste
he
made
up
his
mind
that
he
would
not
go
in
to
tea
that
afternoon
but
hating
himself
he
went
she
nodded
to
him
as
he
came
in
and
smiled
i
expect
i
was
rather
short
with
you
this
morning
she
said
you
see
i
didnt
expect
you
and
it
came
like
a
surprise
oh
it
doesnt
matter
at
all
he
felt
that
a
great
weight
had
suddenly
been
lifted
from
him
he
was
infinitely
grateful
for
one
word
of
kindness
why
dont
you
sit
down
he
asked
nobodys
wanting
you
just
now
i
dont
mind
if
i
do
he
looked
at
her
but
could
think
of
nothing
to
say
he
racked
his
brains
anxiously
seeking
for
a
remark
which
should
keep
her
by
him
he
wanted
to
tell
her
how
much
she
meant
to
him
but
he
did
not
know
how
to
make
love
now
that
he
loved
in
earnest
wheres
your
friend
with
the
fair
moustache
i
havent
seen
him
lately
oh
hes
gone
back
to
birmingham
hes
in
business
there
he
only
comes
up
to
london
every
now
and
again
is
he
in
love
with
you
youd
better
ask
him
she
said
with
a
laugh
i
dont
know
what
its
got
to
do
with
you
if
he
is
a
bitter
answer
leaped
to
his
tongue
but
he
was
learning
selfrestraint
i
wonder
why
you
say
things
like
that
was
all
he
permitted
himself
to
say
she
looked
at
him
with
those
indifferent
eyes
of
hers
it
looks
as
if
you
didnt
set
much
store
on
me
he
added
why
should
i
no
reason
at
all
he
reached
over
for
his
paper
you
are
quicktempered
she
said
when
she
saw
the
gesture
you
do
take
offence
easily
he
smiled
and
looked
at
her
appealingly
will
you
do
something
for
me
he
asked
that
depends
what
it
is
let
me
walk
back
to
the
station
with
you
tonight
i
dont
mind
he
went
out
after
tea
and
went
back
to
his
rooms
but
at
eight
oclock
when
the
shop
closed
he
was
waiting
outside
you
are
a
caution
she
said
when
she
came
out
i
dont
understand
you
i
shouldnt
have
thought
it
was
very
difficult
he
answered
bitterly
did
any
of
the
girls
see
you
waiting
for
me
i
dont
know
and
i
dont
care
they
all
laugh
at
you
you
know
they
say
youre
spoony
on
me
much
you
care
he
muttered
now
then
quarrelsome
at
the
station
he
took
a
ticket
and
said
he
was
going
to
accompany
her
home
you
dont
seem
to
have
much
to
do
with
your
time
she
said
i
suppose
i
can
waste
it
in
my
own
way
they
seemed
to
be
always
on
the
verge
of
a
quarrel
the
fact
was
that
he
hated
himself
for
loving
her
she
seemed
to
be
constantly
humiliating
him
and
for
each
snub
that
he
endured
he
owed
her
a
grudge
but
she
was
in
a
friendly
mood
that
evening
and
talkative
she
told
him
that
her
parents
were
dead
she
gave
him
to
understand
that
she
did
not
have
to
earn
her
living
but
worked
for
amusement
my
aunt
doesnt
like
my
going
to
business
i
can
have
the
best
of
everything
at
home
i
dont
want
you
to
think
i
work
because
i
need
to
philip
knew
that
she
was
not
speaking
the
truth
the
gentility
of
her
class
made
her
use
this
pretence
to
avoid
the
stigma
attached
to
earning
her
living
my
familys
very
wellconnected
she
said
philip
smiled
faintly
and
she
noticed
it
what
are
you
laughing
at
she
said
quickly
dont
you
believe
im
telling
you
the
truth
of
course
i
do
he
answered
she
looked
at
him
suspiciously
but
in
a
moment
could
not
resist
the
temptation
to
impress
him
with
the
splendour
of
her
early
days
my
father
always
kept
a
dogcart
and
we
had
three
servants
we
had
a
cook
and
a
housemaid
and
an
odd
man
we
used
to
grow
beautiful
roses
people
used
to
stop
at
the
gate
and
ask
who
the
house
belonged
to
the
roses
were
so
beautiful
of
course
it
isnt
very
nice
for
me
having
to
mix
with
them
girls
in
the
shop
its
not
the
class
of
person
ive
been
used
to
and
sometimes
i
really
think
ill
give
up
business
on
that
account
its
not
the
work
i
mind
dont
think
that
but
its
the
class
of
people
i
have
to
mix
with
they
were
sitting
opposite
one
another
in
the
train
and
philip
listening
sympathetically
to
what
she
said
was
quite
happy
he
was
amused
at
her
naivete
and
slightly
touched
there
was
a
very
faint
colour
in
her
cheeks
he
was
thinking
that
it
would
be
delightful
to
kiss
the
tip
of
her
chin
the
moment
you
come
into
the
shop
i
saw
you
was
a
gentleman
in
every
sense
of
the
word
was
your
father
a
professional
man
he
was
a
doctor
you
can
always
tell
a
professional
man
theres
something
about
them
i
dont
know
what
it
is
but
i
know
at
once
they
walked
along
from
the
station
together
i
say
i
want
you
to
come
and
see
another
play
with
me
he
said
i
dont
mind
she
said
you
might
go
so
far
as
to
say
youd
like
to
why
it
doesnt
matter
lets
fix
a
day
would
saturday
night
suit
you
yes
thatll
do
they
made
further
arrangements
and
then
found
themselves
at
the
corner
of
the
road
in
which
she
lived
she
gave
him
her
hand
and
he
held
it
i
say
i
do
so
awfully
want
to
call
you
mildred
you
may
if
you
like
i
dont
care
and
youll
call
me
philip
wont
you
i
will
if
i
can
think
of
it
it
seems
more
natural
to
call
you
mr
carey
he
drew
her
slightly
towards
him
but
she
leaned
back
what
are
you
doing
wont
you
kiss
me
goodnight
he
whispered
impudence
she
said
she
snatched
away
her
hand
and
hurried
towards
her
house
philip
bought
tickets
for
saturday
night
it
was
not
one
of
the
days
on
which
she
got
off
early
and
therefore
she
would
have
no
time
to
go
home
and
change
but
she
meant
to
bring
a
frock
up
with
her
in
the
morning
and
hurry
into
her
clothes
at
the
shop
if
the
manageress
was
in
a
good
temper
she
would
let
her
go
at
seven
philip
had
agreed
to
wait
outside
from
a
quarter
past
seven
onwards
he
looked
forward
to
the
occasion
with
painful
eagerness
for
in
the
cab
on
the
way
from
the
theatre
to
the
station
he
thought
she
would
let
him
kiss
her
the
vehicle
gave
every
facility
for
a
man
to
put
his
arm
round
a
girls
waist
an
advantage
which
the
hansom
had
over
the
taxi
of
the
present
day
and
the
delight
of
that
was
worth
the
cost
of
the
evenings
entertainment
but
on
saturday
afternoon
when
he
went
in
to
have
tea
in
order
to
confirm
the
arrangements
he
met
the
man
with
the
fair
moustache
coming
out
of
the
shop
he
knew
by
now
that
he
was
called
miller
he
was
a
naturalized
german
who
had
anglicised
his
name
and
he
had
lived
many
years
in
england
philip
had
heard
him
speak
and
though
his
english
was
fluent
and
natural
it
had
not
quite
the
intonation
of
the
native
philip
knew
that
he
was
flirting
with
mildred
and
he
was
horribly
jealous
of
him
but
he
took
comfort
in
the
coldness
of
her
temperament
which
otherwise
distressed
him
and
thinking
her
incapable
of
passion
he
looked
upon
his
rival
as
no
better
off
than
himself
but
his
heart
sank
now
for
his
first
thought
was
that
millers
sudden
appearance
might
interfere
with
the
jaunt
which
he
had
so
looked
forward
to
he
entered
sick
with
apprehension
the
waitress
came
up
to
him
took
his
order
for
tea
and
presently
brought
it
im
awfully
sorry
she
said
with
an
expression
on
her
face
of
real
distress
i
shant
be
able
to
come
tonight
after
all
why
said
philip
dont
look
so
stern
about
it
she
laughed
its
not
my
fault
my
aunt
was
taken
ill
last
night
and
its
the
girls
night
out
so
i
must
go
and
sit
with
her
she
cant
be
left
alone
can
she
it
doesnt
matter
ill
see
you
home
instead
but
youve
got
the
tickets
it
would
be
a
pity
to
waste
them
he
took
them
out
of
his
pocket
and
deliberately
tore
them
up
what
are
you
doing
that
for
you
dont
suppose
i
want
to
go
and
see
a
rotten
musical
comedy
by
myself
do
you
i
only
took
seats
there
for
your
sake
you
cant
see
me
home
if
thats
what
you
mean
youve
made
other
arrangements
i
dont
know
what
you
mean
by
that
youre
just
as
selfish
as
all
the
rest
of
them
you
only
think
of
yourself
its
not
my
fault
if
my
aunts
queer
she
quickly
wrote
out
his
bill
and
left
him
philip
knew
very
little
about
women
or
he
would
have
been
aware
that
one
should
accept
their
most
transparent
lies
he
made
up
his
mind
that
he
would
watch
the
shop
and
see
for
certain
whether
mildred
went
out
with
the
german
he
had
an
unhappy
passion
for
certainty
at
seven
he
stationed
himself
on
the
opposite
pavement
he
looked
about
for
miller
but
did
not
see
him
in
ten
minutes
she
came
out
she
had
on
the
cloak
and
shawl
which
she
had
worn
when
he
took
her
to
the
shaftesbury
theatre
it
was
obvious
that
she
was
not
going
home
she
saw
him
before
he
had
time
to
move
away
started
a
little
and
then
came
straight
up
to
him
what
are
you
doing
here
she
said
taking
the
air
he
answered
youre
spying
on
me
you
dirty
little
cad
i
thought
you
was
a
gentleman
did
you
think
a
gentleman
would
be
likely
to
take
any
interest
in
you
he
murmured
there
was
a
devil
within
him
which
forced
him
to
make
matters
worse
he
wanted
to
hurt
her
as
much
as
she
was
hurting
him
i
suppose
i
can
change
my
mind
if
i
like
im
not
obliged
to
come
out
with
you
i
tell
you
im
going
home
and
i
wont
be
followed
or
spied
upon
have
you
seen
miller
today
thats
no
business
of
yours
in
point
of
fact
i
havent
so
youre
wrong
again
i
saw
him
this
afternoon
hed
just
come
out
of
the
shop
when
i
went
in
well
what
if
he
did
i
can
go
out
with
him
if
i
want

cant
i
i
dont
know
what
youve
got
to
say
to
it
hes
keeping
you
waiting
isnt
he
well
id
rather
wait
for
him
than
have
you
wait
for
me
put
that
in
your
pipe
and
smoke
it
and
now
praps
youll
go
off
home
and
mind
your
own
business
in
future
his
mood
changed
suddenly
from
anger
to
despair
and
his
voice
trembled
when
he
spoke
i
say
dont
be
beastly
with
me
mildred
you
know
im
awfully
fond
of
you
i
think
i
love
you
with
all
my
heart
wont

your
mind
i
was
looking
forward
to
this
evening
so
awfully

he
cant

twopence
about

no
good

ive
made
up
my
mind
and
when
i
make
up
my
mind
i
keep
to
it
he
looked
at
her
for
a
moment
his
heart
was
torn
with
anguish
people
were
hurrying
past
them
on
the
pavement
and
cabs
and
omnibuses
rolled
by
noisily
he
saw
that
mildreds
eyes
were
wandering
she
was
afraid
of
missing
miller
in
the
crowd
i
cant
go
on
like
this
groaned
philip
its
too
degrading
if
i
go
now
i
go
for
good
unless
youll
come
with
me
tonight
youll
never
see
me
again
you
seem
to
think
thatll
be
an
awful
thing
for
me
all
i
say
is
good
riddance
to
bad
rubbish
then
goodbye
he
nodded
and
limped
away
slowly
for
he
hoped
with
all
his
heart
that
she
would
call
him
back
at
the
next
lamppost
he
stopped
and
looked
over
his
shoulder
he
thought
she
might
beckon
to
himhe
was
willing
to
forget
everything
he
was
ready
for
any
humiliationbut
she
had
turned
away
and
apparently
had
ceased
to
trouble
about
him
he
realised
that
she
was
glad
to
be
quit
of
him
chapter
lix
philip
passed
the
evening
wretchedly
he
had
told
his
landlady
that
he
would
not
be
in
so
there
was
nothing
for
him
to
eat
and
he
had
to
go
to
gattis
for
dinner
afterwards
he
went
back
to
his
rooms
but
griffiths
on
the
floor
above
him
was
having
a
party
and
the
noisy
merriment
made
his
own
misery
more
hard
to
bear
he
went
to
a
musichall
but
it
was
saturday
night
and
there
was
standingroom
only
after
half
an
hour
of
boredom
his
legs
grew
tired
and
he
went
home
he
tried
to
read
but
he
could
not
fix
his
attention
and
yet
it
was
necessary
that
he
should
work
hard
his
examination
in
biology
was
in
little
more
than
a
fortnight
and
though
it
was
easy
he
had
neglected
his
lectures
of
late
and
was
conscious
that
he
knew
nothing
it
was
only
a
viva
however
and
he
felt
sure
that
in
a
fortnight
he
could
find
out
enough
about
the
subject
to
scrape
through
he
had
confidence
in
his
intelligence
he
threw
aside
his
book
and
gave
himself
up
to
thinking
deliberately
of
the
matter
which
was
in
his
mind
all
the
time
he
reproached
himself
bitterly
for
his
behaviour
that
evening
why
had
he
given
her
the
alternative
that
she
must
dine
with
him
or
else
never
see
him
again
of
course
she
refused
he
should
have
allowed
for
her
pride
he
had
burnt
his
ships
behind
him
it
would
not
be
so
hard
to
bear
if
he
thought
that
she
was
suffering
now
but
he
knew
her
too
well
she
was
perfectly
indifferent
to
him
if
he
hadnt
been
a
fool
he
would
have
pretended
to
believe
her
story
he
ought
to
have
had
the
strength
to
conceal
his
disappointment
and
the
selfcontrol
to
master
his
temper
he
could
not
tell
why
he
loved
her
he
had
read
of
the
idealisation
that
takes
place
in
love
but
he
saw
her
exactly
as
she
was
she
was
not
amusing
or
clever
her
mind
was
common
she
had
a
vulgar
shrewdness
which
revolted
him
she
had
no
gentleness
nor
softness
as
she
would
have
put
it
herself
she
was
on
the
make
what
aroused
her
admiration
was
a
clever
trick
played
on
an
unsuspecting
person
to
do
somebody
always
gave
her
satisfaction
philip
laughed
savagely
as
he
thought
of
her
gentility
and
the
refinement
with
which
she
ate
her
food
she
could
not
bear
a
coarse
word
so
far
as
her
limited
vocabulary
reached
she
had
a
passion
for
euphemisms
and
she
scented
indecency
everywhere
she
never
spoke
of
trousers
but
referred
to
them
as
nether
garments
she
thought
it
slightly
indelicate
to
blow
her
nose
and
did
it
in
a
deprecating
way
she
was
dreadfully
anaemic
and
suffered
from
the
dyspepsia
which
accompanies
that
ailing
philip
was
repelled
by
her
flat
breast
and
narrow
hips
and
he
hated
the
vulgar
way
in
which
she
did
her
hair
he
loathed
and
despised
himself
for
loving
her
the
fact
remained
that
he
was
helpless
he
felt
just
as
he
had
felt
sometimes
in
the
hands
of
a
bigger
boy
at
school
he
had
struggled
against
the
superior
strength
till
his
own
strength
was
gone
and
he
was
rendered
quite
powerlesshe
remembered
the
peculiar
languor
he
had
felt
in
his
limbs
almost
as
though
he
were
paralysedso
that
he
could
not
help
himself
at
all
he
might
have
been
dead
he
felt
just
that
same
weakness
now
he
loved
the
woman
so
that
he
knew
he
had
never
loved
before
he
did
not
mind
her
faults
of
person
or
of
character
he
thought
he
loved
them
too
at
all
events
they
meant
nothing
to
him
it
did
not
seem
himself
that
was
concerned
he
felt
that
he
had
been
seized
by
some
strange
force
that
moved
him
against
his
will
contrary
to
his
interests
and
because
he
had
a
passion
for
freedom
he
hated
the
chains
which
bound
him
he
laughed
at
himself
when
he
thought
how
often
he
had
longed
to
experience
the
overwhelming
passion
he
cursed
himself
because
he
had
given
way
to
it
he
thought
of
the
beginnings
nothing
of
all
this
would
have
happened
if
he
had
not
gone
into
the
shop
with
dunsford
the
whole
thing
was
his
own
fault
except
for
his
ridiculous
vanity
he
would
never
have
troubled
himself
with
the
illmannered
slut
at
all
events
the
occurrences
of
that
evening
had
finished
the
whole
affair
unless
he
was
lost
to
all
sense
of
shame
he
could
not
go
back
he
wanted
passionately
to
get
rid
of
the
love
that
obsessed
him
it
was
degrading
and
hateful
he
must
prevent
himself
from
thinking
of
her
in
a
little
while
the
anguish
he
suffered
must
grow
less
his
mind
went
back
to
the
past
he
wondered
whether
emily
wilkinson
and
fanny
price
had
endured
on
his
account
anything
like
the
torment
that
he
suffered
now
he
felt
a
pang
of
remorse
i
didnt
know
then
what
it
was
like
he
said
to
himself
he
slept
very
badly
the
next
day
was
sunday
and
he
worked
at
his
biology
he
sat
with
the
book
in
front
of
him
forming
the
words
with
his
lips
in
order
to
fix
his
attention
but
he
could
remember
nothing
he
found
his
thoughts
going
back
to
mildred
every
minute
and
he
repeated
to
himself
the
exact
words
of
the
quarrel
they
had
had
he
had
to
force
himself
back
to
his
book
he
went
out
for
a
walk
the
streets
on
the
south
side
of
the
river
were
dingy
enough
on
weekdays
but
there
was
an
energy
a
coming
and
going
which
gave
them
a
sordid
vivacity
but
on
sundays
with
no
shops
open
no
carts
in
the
roadway
silent
and
depressed
they
were
indescribably
dreary
philip
thought
that
day
would
never
end
but
he
was
so
tired
that
he
slept
heavily
and
when
monday
came
he
entered
upon
life
with
determination
christmas
was
approaching
and
a
good
many
of
the
students
had
gone
into
the
country
for
the
short
holiday
between
the
two
parts
of
the
winter
session
but
philip
had
refused
his
uncles
invitation
to
go
down
to
blackstable
he
had
given
the
approaching
examination
as
his
excuse
but
in
point
of
fact
he
had
been
unwilling
to
leave
london
and
mildred
he
had
neglected
his
work
so
much
that
now
he
had
only
a
fortnight
to
learn
what
the
curriculum
allowed
three
months
for
he
set
to
work
seriously
he
found
it
easier
each
day
not
to
think
of
mildred
he
congratulated
himself
on
his
force
of
character
the
pain
he
suffered
was
no
longer
anguish
but
a
sort
of
soreness
like
what
one
might
be
expected
to
feel
if
one
had
been
thrown
off
a
horse
and
though
no
bones
were
broken
were
bruised
all
over
and
shaken
philip
found
that
he
was
able
to
observe
with
curiosity
the
condition
he
had
been
in
during
the
last
few
weeks
he
analysed
his
feelings
with
interest
he
was
a
little
amused
at
himself
one
thing
that
struck
him
was
how
little
under
those
circumstances
it
mattered
what
one
thought
the
system
of
personal
philosophy
which
had
given
him
great
satisfaction
to
devise
had
not
served
him
he
was
puzzled
by
this
but
sometimes
in
the
street
he
would
see
a
girl
who
looked
so
like
mildred
that
his
heart
seemed
to
stop
beating
then
he
could
not
help
himself
he
hurried
on
to
catch
her
up
eager
and
anxious
only
to
find
that
it
was
a
total
stranger
men
came
back
from
the
country
and
he
went
with
dunsford
to
have
tea
at
an
a
b
c
shop
the
wellknown
uniform
made
him
so
miserable
that
he
could
not
speak
the
thought
came
to
him
that
perhaps
she
had
been
transferred
to
another
establishment
of
the
firm
for
which
she
worked
and
he
might
suddenly
find
himself
face
to
face
with
her
the
idea
filled
him
with
panic
so
that
he
feared
dunsford
would
see
that
something
was
the
matter
with
him
he
could
not
think
of
anything
to
say
he
pretended
to
listen
to
what
dunsford
was
talking
about
the
conversation
maddened
him
and
it
was
all
he
could
do
to
prevent
himself
from
crying
out
to
dunsford
for
heavens
sake
to
hold
his
tongue
then
came
the
day
of
his
examination
philip
when
his
turn
arrived
went
forward
to
the
examiners
table
with
the
utmost
confidence
he
answered
three
or
four
questions
then
they
showed
him
various
specimens
he
had
been
to
very
few
lectures
and
as
soon
as
he
was
asked
about
things
which
he
could
not
learn
from
books
he
was
floored
he
did
what
he
could
to
hide
his
ignorance
the
examiner
did
not
insist
and
soon
his
ten
minutes
were
over
he
felt
certain
he
had
passed
but
next
day
when
he
went
up
to
the
examination
buildings
to
see
the
result
posted
on
the
door
he
was
astounded
not
to
find
his
number
amoug
those
who
had
satisfied
the
examiners
in
amazement
he
read
the
list
three
times
dunsford
was
with
him
i
say
im
awfully
sorry
youre
ploughed
he
said
he
had
just
inquired
philips
number
philip
turned
and
saw
by
his
radiant
face
that
dunsford
had
passed
oh
it
doesnt
matter
a
bit
said
philip
im
jolly
glad
youre
all
right
i
shall
go
up
again
in
july
he
was
very
anxious
to
pretend
he
did
not
mind
and
on
their
way
back
along
the
embankment
insisted
on
talking
of
indifferent
things
dunsford
goodnaturedly
wanted
to
discuss
the
causes
of
philips
failure
but
philip
was
obstinately
casual
he
was
horribly
mortified
and
the
fact
that
dunsford
whom
he
looked
upon
as
a
very
pleasant
but
quite
stupid
fellow
had
passed
made
his
own
rebuff
harder
to
bear
he
had
always
been
proud
of
his
intelligence
and
now
he
asked
himself
desperately
whether
he
was
not
mistaken
in
the
opinion
he
held
of
himself
in
the
three
months
of
the
winter
session
the
students
who
had
joined
in
october
had
already
shaken
down
into
groups
and
it
was
clear
which
were
brilliant
which
were
clever
or
industrious
and
which
were
rotters
philip
was
conscious
that
his
failure
was
a
surprise
to
no
one
but
himself
it
was
teatime
and
he
knew
that
a
lot
of
men
would
be
having
tea
in
the
basement
of
the
medical
school
those
who
had
passed
the
examination
would
be
exultant
those
who
disliked
him
would
look
at
him
with
satisfaction
and
the
poor
devils
who
had
failed
would
sympathise
with
him
in
order
to
receive
sympathy
his
instinct
was
not
to
go
near
the
hospital
for
a
week
when
the
affair
would
be
no
more
thought
of
but
because
he
hated
so
much
to
go
just
then
he
went
he
wanted
to
inflict
suffering
upon
himself
he
forgot
for
the
moment
his
maxim
of
life
to
follow
his
inclinations
with
due
regard
for
the
policeman
round
the
corner
or
if
he
acted
in
accordance
with
it
there
must
have
been
some
strange
morbidity
in
his
nature
which
made
him
take
a
grim
pleasure
in
selftorture
but
later
on
when
he
had
endured
the
ordeal
to
which
he
forced
himself
going
out
into
the
night
after
the
noisy
conversation
in
the
smokingroom
he
was
seized
with
a
feeling
of
utter
loneliness
he
seemed
to
himself
absurd
and
futile
he
had
an
urgent
need
of
consolation
and
the
temptation
to
see
mildred
was
irresistible
he
thought
bitterly
that
there
was
small
chance
of
consolation
from
her
but
he
wanted
to
see
her
even
if
he
did
not
speak
to
her
after
all
she
was
a
waitress
and
would
be
obliged
to
serve
him
she
was
the
only
person
in
the
world
he
cared
for
there
was
no
use
in
hiding
that
fact
from
himself
of
course
it
would
be
humiliating
to
go
back
to
the
shop
as
though
nothing
had
happened
but
he
had
not
much
selfrespect
left
though
he
would
not
confess
it
to
himself
he
had
hoped
each
day
that
she
would
write
to
him
she
knew
that
a
letter
addressed
to
the
hospital
would
find
him
but
she
had
not
written
it
was
evident
that
she
cared
nothing
if
she
saw
him
again
or
not
and
he
kept
on
repeating
to
himself
i
must
see
her
i
must
see
her
the
desire
was
so
great
that
he
could
not
give
the
time
necessary
to
walk
but
jumped
in
a
cab
he
was
too
thrifty
to
use
one
when
it
could
possibly
be
avoided
he
stood
outside
the
shop
for
a
minute
or
two
the
thought
came
to
him
that
perhaps
she
had
left
and
in
terror
he
walked
in
quickly
he
saw
her
at
once
he
sat
down
and
she
came
up
to
him
a
cup
of
tea
and
a
muffin
please
he
ordered
he
could
hardly
speak
he
was
afraid
for
a
moment
that
he
was
going
to
cry
i
almost
thought
you
was
dead
she
said
she
was
smiling
smiling
she
seemed
to
have
forgotten
completely
that
last
scene
which
philip
had
repeated
to
himself
a
hundred
times
i
thought
if
youd
wanted
to
see
me
youd
write
he
answered
ive
got
too
much
to
do
to
think
about
writing
letters
it
seemed
impossible
for
her
to
say
a
gracious
thing
philip
cursed
the
fate
which
chained
him
to
such
a
woman
she
went
away
to
fetch
his
tea
would
you
like
me
to
sit
down
for
a
minute
or
two
she
said
when
she
brought
it
yes
where
have
you
been
all
this
time
ive
been
in
london
i
thought
youd
gone
away
for
the
holidays
why
havent
you
been
in
then
philip
looked
at
her
with
haggard
passionate
eyes
dont
you
remember
that
i
said
id
never
see
you
again
what
are
you
doing
now
then
she
seemed
anxious
to
make
him
drink
up
the
cup
of
his
humiliation
but
he
knew
her
well
enough
to
know
that
she
spoke
at
random
she
hurt
him
frightfully
and
never
even
tried
to
he
did
not
answer
it
was
a
nasty
trick
you
played
on
me
spying
on
me
like
that
i
always
thought
you
was
a
gentleman
in
every
sense
of
the
word
dont
be
beastly
to
me
mildred
i
cant
bear
it
you
are
a
funny
feller
i
cant
make
you
out
its
very
simple
im
such
a
blasted
fool
as
to
love
you
with
all
my
heart
and
soul
and
i
know
that
you
dont
care
twopence
for
me
if
you
had
been
a
gentleman
i
think
youd
have
come
next
day
and
begged
my
pardon
she
had
no
mercy
he
looked
at
her
neck
and
thought
how
he
would
like
to
jab
it
with
the
knife
he
had
for
his
muffin
he
knew
enough
anatomy
to
make
pretty
certain
of
getting
the
carotid
artery
and
at
the
same
time
he
wanted
to
cover
her
pale
thin
face
with
kisses
if
i
could
only
make
you
understand
how
frightfully
im
in
love
with
you
you
havent
begged
my
pardon
yet
he
grew
very
white
she
felt
that
she
had
done
nothing
wrong
on
that
occasion
she
wanted
him
now
to
humble
himself
he
was
very
proud
for
one
instant
he
felt
inclined
to
tell
her
to
go
to
hell
but
he
dared
not
his
passion
made
him
abject
he
was
willing
to
submit
to
anything
rather
than
not
see
her
im
very
sorry
mildred
i
beg
your
pardon
he
had
to
force
the
words
out
it
was
a
horrible
effort
now
youve
said
that
i
dont
mind
telling
you
that
i
wish
i
had
come
out
with
you
that
evening
i
thought
miller
was
a
gentleman
but
ive
discovered
my
mistake
now
i
soon
sent
him
about
his
business
philip
gave
a
little
gasp
mildred
wont

come
out
with
me
tonight

go
and
dine
somewhere
oh

cant
my
auntll

better

gods

so
long
and

she
looked
down
at
her
clothes
never
mind
about
that
well

somewhere
where
it
doesnt
matter
how
youre
dressed
and
well
go
to
a
musichall
afterwards
please
say
yes
it
would
give
me
so
much
pleasure
she
hesitated
a
moment
he
looked
at
her
with
pitifully
appealing
eyes
well
i
dont
mind
if
i
do
i
havent
been
out
anywhere
since
i
dont
know
how
long
it
was
with
the
greatest
difficulty
he
could
prevent
himself
from
seizing
her
hand
there
and
then
to
cover
it
with
kisses
chapter
lx
they
dined
in
soho
philip
was
tremulous
with
joy
it
was
not
one
of
the
more
crowded
of
those
cheap
restaurants
where
the
respectable
and
needy
dine
in
the
belief
that
it
is
bohemian
and
the
assurance
that
it
is
economical
it
was
a
humble
establishment
kept
by
a
good
man
from
rouen
and
his
wife
that
philip
had
discovered
by
accident
he
had
been
attracted
by
the
gallic
look
of
the
window
in
which
was
generally
an
uncooked
steak
on
one
plate
and
on
each
side
two
dishes
of
raw
vegetables
there
was
one
seedy
french
waiter
who
was
attempting
to
learn
english
in
a
house
where
he
never
heard
anything
but
french
and
the
customers
were
a
few
ladies
of
easy
virtue
a
menage
or
two
who
had
their
own
napkins
reserved
for
them
and
a
few
queer
men
who
came
in
for
hurried
scanty
meals
here
mildred
and
philip
were
able
to
get
a
table
to
themselves
philip
sent
the
waiter
for
a
bottle
of
burgundy
from
the
neighbouring
tavern
and
they
had
a
potage
aux
herbes
a
steak
from
the
window
aux
pommes
and
an
omelette
au
kirsch
there
was
really
an
air
of
romance
in
the
meal
and
in
the
place
mildred
at
first
a
little
reserved
in
her
appreciationi
never
quite
trust
these
foreign
places
you
never
know
what
there
is
in
these
messed
up
disheswas
insensibly
moved
hy
it
i
like
this
place
philip
she
said
you
feel
you
can
put
your
elbows
on
the
table
dont
you
a
tall
fellow
came
in
with
a
mane
of
gray
hair
and
a
ragged
thin
beard
he
wore
a
dilapidated
cloak
and
a
wideawake
hat
he
nodded
to
philip
who
had
met
him
there
before
he
looks
like
an
anarchist
said
mildred
he
is
one
of
the
most
dangerous
in
europe
hes
been
in
every
prison
on
the
continent
and
has
assassinated
more
persons
than
any
gentleman
unhung
he
always
goes
about
with
a
bomb
in
his
pocket
and
of
course
it
makes
conversation
a
little
difficult
because
if
you
dont
agree
with
him
he
lays
it
on
the
table
in
a
marked
manner
she
looked
at
the
man
with
horror
and
surprise
and
then
glanced
suspiciously
at
philip
she
saw
that
his
eyes
were
laughing
she
frowned
a
little
youre
getting
at
me
he
gave
a
little
shout
of
joy
he
was
so
happy
but
mildred
didnt
like
being
laughed
at
i
don
t
see
anything
funny
in
telling
lies
dont
be
cross
he
took
her
hand
which
was
lying
on
the
table
and
pressed
it
gently
you
are
lovely
and
i
could
kiss
the
ground
you
walk
on
he
said
the
greenish
pallor
of
her
skin
intoxicated
him
and
her
thin
white
lips
had
an
extraordinary
fascination
her
anaemia
made
her
rather
short
of
breath
and
she
held
her
mouth
slightly
open
it
seemed
to
add
somehow
to
the
attractiveness
of
her
face
you
do
like
me
a
bit
dont
you
he
asked
well
if
i
didnt
i
suppose
i
shouldnt
be
here
should
i
youre
a
gentleman
in
every
sense
of
the
word
i
will
say
that
for
you
they
had
finished
their
dinner
and
were
drinking
coffee
philip
throwing
economy
to
the
winds
smoked
a
threepenny
cigar
you
cant
imagine
what
a
pleasure
it
is
to
me
just
to
sit
opposite
and
look
at
you
ive
yearned
for
you
i
was
sick
for
a
sight
of
you
mildred
smiled
a
little
and
faintly
flushed
she
was
not
then
suffering
from
the
dyspepsia
which
generally
attacked
her
immediately
after
a
meal
she
felt
more
kindly
disposed
to
philip
than
ever
before
and
the
unaccustomed
tenderness
in
her
eyes
filled
him
with
joy
he
knew
instinctively
that
it
was
madness
to
give
himself
into
her
hands
his
only
chance
was
to
treat
her
casually
and
never
allow
her
to
see
the
untamed
passions
that
seethed
in
his
breast
she
would
only
take
advantage
of
his
weakness
but
he
could
not
be
prudent
now
he
told
her
all
the
agony
he
had
endured
during
the
separation
from
her
he
told
her
of
his
struggles
with
himself
how
he
had
tried
to
get
over
his
passion
thought
he
had
succeeded
and
how
he
found
out
that
it
was
as
strong
as
ever
he
knew
that
he
had
never
really
wanted
to
get
over
it
he
loved
her
so
much
that
he
did
not
mind
suffering
he
bared
his
heart
to
her
he
showed
her
proudly
all
his
weakness
nothing
would
have
pleased
him
more
than
to
sit
on
in
the
cosy
shabby
restaurant
but
he
knew
that
mildred
wanted
entertainment
she
was
restless
and
wherever
she
was
wanted
after
a
while
to
go
somewhere
else
he
dared
not
bore
her
i
say
how
about
going
to
a
musichall
he
said
he
thought
rapidly
that
if
she
cared
for
him
at
all
she
would
say
she
preferred
to
stay
there
i
was
just
thinking
we
ought
to
be
going
if
we
are
going
she
answered
come
on
then
philip
waited
impatiently
for
the
end
of
the
performance
he
had
made
up
his
mind
exactly
what
to
do
and
when
they
got
into
the
cab
he
passed
his
arm
as
though
almost
by
accident
round
her
waist
but
he
drew
it
back
quickly
with
a
little
cry
he
had
pricked
himself
she
laughed
there
that
comes
of
putting
your
arm
where
its
got
no
business
to
be
she
said
i
always
know
when
men
try
and
put
their
arm
round
my
waist
that
pin
always
catches
them
ill
be
more
careful
he
put
his
arm
round
again
she
made
no
objection
im
so
comfortable
he
sighed
blissfully
so
long
as
youre
happy
she
retorted
they
drove
down
st
james
street
into
the
park
and
philip
quickly
kissed
her
he
was
strangely
afraid
of
her
and
it
required
all
his
courage
she
turned
her
lips
to
him
without
speaking
she
neither
seemed
to
mind
nor
to
like
it
if
you
only
knew
how
long
ive
wanted
to
do
that
he
murmured
he
tried
to
kiss
her
again
but
she
turned
her
head
away
once
is
enough
she
said
on
the
chance
of
kissing
her
a
second
time
he
travelled
down
to
herne
hill
with
her
and
at
the
end
of
the
road
in
which
she
lived
he
asked
her
wont
you
give
me
another
kiss
she
looked
at
him
indifferently
and
then
glanced
up
the
road
to
see
that
no
one
was
in
sight
i
dont
mind
he
seized
her
in
his
arms
and
kissed
her
passionately
but
she
pushed
him
away
mind
my
hat
silly
you
are
clumsy
she
said
chapter
lxi
he
saw
her
then
every
day
he
began
going
to
lunch
at
the
shop
but
mildred
stopped
him
she
said
it
made
the
girls
talk
so
he
had
to
content
himself
with
tea
but
he
always
waited
about
to
walk
with
her
to
the
station
and
once
or
twice
a
week
they
dined
together
he
gave
her
little
presents
a
gold
bangle
gloves
handkerchiefs
and
the
like
he
was
spending
more
than
he
could
afford
but
he
could
not
help
it
it
was
only
when
he
gave
her
anything
that
she
showed
any
affection
she
knew
the
price
of
everything
and
her
gratitude
was
in
exact
proportion
with
the
value
of
his
gift
he
did
not
care
he
was
too
happy
when
she
volunteered
to
kiss
him
to
mind
by
what
means
he
got
her
demonstrativeness
he
discovered
that
she
found
sundays
at
home
tedious
so
he
went
down
to
herne
hill
in
the
morning
met
her
at
the
end
of
the
road
and
went
to
church
with
her
i
always
like
to
go
to
church
once
she
said
it
looks
well
doesnt
it
then
she
went
back
to
dinner
he
got
a
scrappy
meal
at
a
hotel
and
in
the
afternoon
they
took
a
walk
in
brockwell
park
they
had
nothing
much
to
say
to
one
another
and
philip
desperately
afraid
she
was
bored
she
was
very
easily
bored
racked
his
brain
for
topics
of
conversation
he
realised
that
these
walks
amused
neither
of
them
but
he
could
not
bear
to
leave
her
and
did
all
he
could
to
lengthen
them
till
she
became
tired
and
out
of
temper
he
knew
that
she
did
not
care
for
him
and
he
tried
to
force
a
love
which
his
reason
told
him
was
not
in
her
nature
she
was
cold
he
had
no
claim
on
her
but
he
could
not
help
being
exacting
now
that
they
were
more
intimate
he
found
it
less
easy
to
control
his
temper
he
was
often
irritable
and
could
not
help
saying
bitter
things
often
they
quarrelled
and
she
would
not
speak
to
him
for
a
while
but
this
always
reduced
him
to
subjection
and
he
crawled
before
her
he
was
angry
with
himself
for
showing
so
little
dignity
he
grew
furiously
jealous
if
he
saw
her
speaking
to
any
other
man
in
the
shop
and
when
he
was
jealous
he
seemed
to
be
beside
himself
he
would
deliberately
insult
her
leave
the
shop
and
spend
afterwards
a
sleepless
night
tossing
on
his
bed
by
turns
angry
and
remorseful
next
day
he
would
go
to
the
shop
and
appeal
for
forgiveness
dont
be
angry
with
me
he
said
im
so
awfully
fond
of
you
that
i
cant
help
myself
one
of
these
days
youll
go
too
far
she
answered
he
was
anxious
to
come
to
her
home
in
order
that
the
greater
intimacy
should
give
him
an
advantage
over
the
stray
acquaintances
she
made
during
her
workinghours
but
she
would
not
let
him
my
aunt
would
think
it
so
funny
she
said
he
suspected
that
her
refusal
was
due
only
to
a
disinclination
to
let
him
see
her
aunt
mildred
had
represented
her
as
the
widow
of
a
professional
man
that
was
her
formula
of
distinction
and
was
uneasily
conscious
that
the
good
woman
could
hardly
be
called
distinguished
philip
imagined
that
she
was
in
point
of
fact
the
widow
of
a
small
tradesman
he
knew
that
mildred
was
a
snob
but
he
found
no
means
by
which
he
could
indicate
to
her
that
he
did
not
mind
how
common
the
aunt
was
their
worst
quarrel
took
place
one
evening
at
dinner
when
she
told
him
that
a
man
had
asked
her
to
go
to
a
play
with
him
philip
turned
pale
and
his
face
grew
hard
and
stern
youre
not
going
he
said
why
shouldnt
i
hes
a
very
nice
gentlemanly
fellow
ill
take
you
anywhere
you
like
but
that
isnt
the
same
thing
i
cant
always
go
about
with
you
besides
hes
asked
me
to
fix
my
own
day
and
ill
just
go
one
evening
when
im
not
going
out
with
you
it
wont
make
any
difference
to
you
if
you
had
any
sense
of
decency
if
you
had
any
gratitude
you
wouldnt
dream
of
going
i
dont
know
what
you
mean
by
gratitude
if
youre
referring
to
the
things
youve
given
me
you
can
have
them
back
i
dont
want
them
her
voice
had
the
shrewish
tone
it
sometimes
got
its
not
very
lively
always
going
about
with
you
its
always
do
you
love
me
do
you
love
me
till
i
just
get
about
sick
of
it
he
knew
it
was
madness
to
go
on
asking
her
that
but
he
could
not
help
himself
oh
i
like
you
all
right
she
would
answer
is
that
all
i
love
you
with
all
my
heart
im
not
that
sort
im
not
one
to
say
much
if
you
knew
how
happy
just
one
word
would
make
me
well
what
i
always
say
is
people
must
take
me
as
they
find
me
and
if
they
dont
like
it
they
can
lump
it
but
sometimes
she
expressed
herself
more
plainly
still
and
when
he
asked
the
question
answered
oh
dont
go
on
at
that
again
then
he
became
sulky
and
silent
he
hated
her
and
now
he
said
oh
well
if
you
feel
like
that
about
it
i
wonder
you
condescend
to
come
out
with
me
at
all
its
not
my
seeking
you
can
be
very
sure
of
that
you
just
force
me
to
his
pride
was
bitterly
hurt
and
he
answered
madly
you
think
im
just
good
enough
to
stand
you
dinners
and
theatres
when
theres
no
one
else
to
do
it
and
when
someone
else
turns
up
i
can
go
to
hell
thank
you
im
about
sick
of
being
made
a
convenience
im
not
going
to
be
talked
to
like
that
by
anyone
ill
just
show
you
how
much
i
want
your
dirty
dinner
she
got
up
put
on
her
jacket
and
walked
quickly
out
of
the
restaurant
philip
sat
on
he
determined
he
would
not
move
but
ten
minutes
afterwards
he
jumped
in
a
cab
and
followed
her
he
guessed
that
she
would
take
a
bus
to
victoria
so
that
they
would
arrive
about
the
same
time
he
saw
her
on
the
platform
escaped
her
notice
and
went
down
to
herne
hill
in
the
same
train
he
did
not
want
to
speak
to
her
till
she
was
on
the
way
home
and
could
not
escape
him
as
soon
as
she
had
turned
out
of
the
main
street
brightly
lit
and
noisy
with
traffic
he
caught
her
up
mildred
he
called
she
walked
on
and
would
neither
look
at
him
nor
answer
he
repeated
her
name
then
she
stopped
and
faced
him
what
dyou
want
i
saw
you
hanging
about
victoria
why
dont
you
leave
me
alone
im
awfully
sorry
wont
you
make
it
up
no
im
sick
of
your
temper
and
your
jealousy
i
dont
care
for
you
i
never
have
cared
for
you
and
i
never
shall
care
for
you
i
dont
want
to
have
anything
more
to
do
with
you
she
walked
on
quickly
and
he
had
to
hurry
to
keep
up
with
her
you
never
make
allowances
for
me
he
said
its
all
very
well
to
be
jolly
and
amiable
when
youre
indifferent
to
anyone
its
very
hard
when
youre
as
much
in
love
as
i
am
have
mercy
on
me
i
dont
mind
that
you
dont
care
for
me
after
all
you
cant
help
it
i
only
want
you
to
let
me
love
you
she
walked
on
refusing
to
speak
and
philip
saw
with
agony
that
they
had
only
a
few
hundred
yards
to
go
before
they
reached
her
house
he
abased
himself
he
poured
out
an
incoherent
story
of
love
and
penitence
if
youll
only
forgive
me
this
time
i
promise
you
youll
never
have
to
complain
of
me
in
future
you
can
go
out
with
whoever
you
choose
ill
be
only
too
glad
if
youll
come
with
me
when
youve
got
nothing
better
to
do
she
stopped
again
for
they
had
reached
the
corner
at
which
he
always
left
her
now
you
can
take
yourself
off
i
wont
have
you
coming
up
to
the
door
i
wont
go
till
you
say
youll
forgive
me
im
sick
and
tired
of
the
whole
thing
he
hesitated
a
moment
for
he
had
an
instinct
that
he
could
say
something
that
would
move
her
it
made
him
feel
almost
sick
to
utter
the
words
it
is
cruel
i
have
so
much
to
put
up
with
you
dont
know
what
it
is
to
be
a
cripple
of
course
you
dont
like
me
i
cant
expect
you
to
philip
i
didnt
mean
that
she
answered
quickly
with
a
sudden
break
of
pity
in
her
voice
you
know
its
not
true
he
was
beginning
to
act
now
and
his
voice
was
husky
and
low
oh
ive
felt
it
he
said
she
took
his
hand
and
looked
at
him
and
her
own
eyes
were
filled
with
tears
i
promise
you
it
never
made
any
difference
to
me
i
never
thought
about
it
after
the
first
day
or
two
he
kept
a
gloomy
tragic
silence
he
wanted
her
to
think
he
was
overcome
with
emotion
you
know
i
like
you
awfully
philip
only
you
are
so
trying
sometimes
lets
make
it
up
she
put
up
her
lips
to
his
and
with
a
sigh
of
relief
he
kissed
her
now
are
you
happy
again
she
asked
madly
she
bade
him
goodnight
and
hurried
down
the
road
next
day
he
took
her
in
a
little
watch
with
a
brooch
to
pin
on
her
dress
she
had
been
hankering
for
it
but
three
or
four
days
later
when
she
brought
him
his
tea
mildred
said
to
him
you
remember
what
you
promised
the
other
night
you
mean
to
keep
that
dont
you
yes
he
knew
exactly
what
she
meant
and
was
prepared
for
her
next
words
because
im
going
out
with
that
gentleman
i
told
you
about
tonight
all
right
i
hope
youll
enjoy
yourself
you
dont
mind
do
you
he
had
himself
now
under
excellent
control
i
dont
like
it
he
smiled
but
im
not
going
to
make
myself
more
disagreeable
than
i
can
help
she
was
excited
over
the
outing
and
talked
about
it
willingly
philip
wondered
whether
she
did
so
in
order
to
pain
him
or
merely
because
she
was
callous
he
was
in
the
habit
of
condoning
her
cruelty
by
the
thought
of
her
stupidity
she
had
not
the
brains
to
see
when
she
was
wounding
him
its
not
much
fun
to
be
in
love
with
a
girl
who
has
no
imagination
and
no
sense
of
humour
he
thought
as
he
listened
but
the
want
of
these
things
excused
her
he
felt
that
if
he
had
not
realised
this
he
could
never
forgive
her
for
the
pain
she
caused
him
hes
got
seats
for
the
tivoli
she
said
he
gave
me
my
choice
and
i
chose
that
and
were
going
to
dine
at
the
cafe
royal
he
says
its
the
most
expensive
place
in
london
hes
a
gentleman
in
every
sense
of
the
word
thought
philip
but
he
clenched
his
teeth
to
prevent
himself
from
uttering
a
syllable
philip
went
to
the
tivoli
and
saw
mildred
with
her
companion
a
smoothfaced
young
man
with
sleek
hair
and
the
spruce
look
of
a
commercial
traveller
sitting
in
the
second
row
of
the
stalls
mildred
wore
a
black
picture
hat
with
ostrich
feathers
in
it
which
became
her
well
she
was
listening
to
her
host
with
that
quiet
smile
which
philip
knew
she
had
no
vivacity
of
expression
and
it
required
broad
farce
to
excite
her
laughter
but
philip
could
see
that
she
was
interested
and
amused
he
thought
to
himself
bitterly
that
her
companion
flashy
and
jovial
exactly
suited
her
her
sluggish
temperament
made
her
appreciate
noisy
people
philip
had
a
passion
for
discussion
but
no
talent
for
smalltalk
he
admired
the
easy
drollery
of
which
some
of
his
friends
were
masters
lawson
for
instance
and
his
sense
of
inferiority
made
him
shy
and
awkward
the
things
which
interested
him
bored
mildred
she
expected
men
to
talk
about
football
and
racing
and
he
knew
nothing
of
either
he
did
not
know
the
catchwords
which
only
need
be
said
to
excite
a
laugh
printed
matter
had
always
been
a
fetish
to
philip
and
now
in
order
to
make
himself
more
interesting
he
read
industriously
the
sporting
times
chapter
lxii
philip
did
not
surrender
himself
willingly
to
the
passion
that
consumed
him
he
knew
that
all
things
human
are
transitory
and
therefore
that
it
must
cease
one
day
or
another
he
looked
forward
to
that
day
with
eager
longing
love
was
like
a
parasite
in
his
heart
nourishing
a
hateful
existence
on
his
lifes
blood
it
absorbed
his
existence
so
intensely
that
he
could
take
pleasure
in
nothing
else
he
had
been
used
to
delight
in
the
grace
of
st
james
park
and
often
he
sat
and
looked
at
the
branches
of
a
tree
silhouetted
against
the
sky
it
was
like
a
japanese
print
and
he
found
a
continual
magic
in
the
beautiful
thames
with
its
barges
and
its
wharfs
the
changing
sky
of
london
had
filled
his
soul
with
pleasant
fancies
but
now
beauty
meant
nothing
to
him
he
was
bored
and
restless
when
he
was
not
with
mildred
sometimes
he
thought
he
would
console
his
sorrow
by
looking
at
pictures
but
he
walked
through
the
national
gallery
like
a
sightseer
and
no
picture
called
up
in
him
a
thrill
of
emotion
he
wondered
if
he
could
ever
care
again
for
all
the
things
he
had
loved
he
had
been
devoted
to
reading
but
now
books
were
meaningless
and
he
spent
his
spare
hours
in
the
smokingroom
of
the
hospital
club
turning
over
innumerable
periodicals
this
love
was
a
torment
and
he
resented
bitterly
the
subjugation
in
which
it
held
him
he
was
a
prisoner
and
he
longed
for
freedom
sometimes
he
awoke
in
the
morning
and
felt
nothing
his
soul
leaped
for
he
thought
he
was
free
he
loved
no
longer
but
in
a
little
while
as
he
grew
wide
awake
the
pain
settled
in
his
heart
and
he
knew
that
he
was
not
cured
yet
though
he
yearned
for
mildred
so
madly
he
despised
her
he
thought
to
himself
that
there
could
be
no
greater
torture
in
the
world
than
at
the
same
time
to
love
and
to
contemn
philip
burrowing
as
was
his
habit
into
the
state
of
his
feelings
discussing
with
himself
continually
his
condition
came
to
the
conclusion
that
he
could
only
cure
himself
of
his
degrading
passion
by
making
mildred
his
mistress
it
was
sexual
hunger
that
he
suffered
from
and
if
he
could
satisfy
this
he
might
free
himself
from
the
intolerable
chains
that
bound
him
he
knew
that
mildred
did
not
care
for
him
at
all
in
that
way
when
he
kissed
her
passionately
she
withdrew
herself
from
him
with
instinctive
distaste
she
had
no
sensuality
sometimes
he
had
tried
to
make
her
jealous
by
talking
of
adventures
in
paris
but
they
did
not
interest
her
once
or
twice
he
had
sat
at
other
tables
in
the
teashop
and
affected
to
flirt
with
the
waitress
who
attended
them
but
she
was
entirely
indifferent
he
could
see
that
it
was
no
pretence
on
her
part
you
didnt
mind
my
not
sitting
at
one
of
your
tables
this
afternoon
he
asked
once
when
he
was
walking
to
the
station
with
her
yours
seemed
to
be
all
full
this
was
not
a
fact
but
she
did
not
contradict
him
even
if
his
desertion
meant
nothing
to
her
he
would
have
been
grateful
if
she
had
pretended
it
did
a
reproach
would
have
been
balm
to
his
soul
i
think
its
silly
of
you
to
sit
at
the
same
table
every
day
you
ought
to
give
the
other
girls
a
turn
now
and
again
but
the
more
he
thought
of
it
the
more
he
was
convinced
that
complete
surrender
on
her
part
was
his
only
way
to
freedom
he
was
like
a
knight
of
old
metamorphosed
by
magic
spells
who
sought
the
potions
which
should
restore
him
to
his
fair
and
proper
form
philip
had
only
one
hope
mildred
greatly
desired
to
go
to
paris
to
her
as
to
most
english
people
it
was
the
centre
of
gaiety
and
fashion
she
had
heard
of
the
magasin
du
louvre
where
you
could
get
the
very
latest
thing
for
about
half
the
price
you
had
to
pay
in
london
a
friend
of
hers
had
passed
her
honeymoon
in
paris
and
had
spent
all
day
at
the
louvre
and
she
and
her
husband
my
dear
they
never
went
to
bed
till
six
in
the
morning
all
the
time
they
were
there
the
moulin
rouge
and
i
dont
know
what
all
philip
did
not
care
that
if
she
yielded
to
his
desires
it
would
only
be
the
unwilling
price
she
paid
for
the
gratification
of
her
wish
he
did
not
care
upon
what
terms
he
satisfied
his
passion
he
had
even
had
a
mad
melodramatic
idea
to
drug
her
he
had
plied
her
with
liquor
in
the
hope
of
exciting
her
but
she
had
no
taste
for
wine
and
though
she
liked
him
to
order
champagne
because
it
looked
well
she
never
drank
more
than
half
a
glass
she
liked
to
leave
untouched
a
large
glass
filled
to
the
brim
it
shows
the
waiters
who
you
are
she
said
philip
chose
an
opportunity
when
she
seemed
more
than
usually
friendly
he
had
an
examination
in
anatomy
at
the
end
of
march
easter
which
came
a
week
later
would
give
mildred
three
whole
days
holiday
i
say
why
dont
you
come
over
to
paris
then
he
suggested
wed
have
such
a
ripping
time
how
could
you
it
would
cost
no
end
of
money
philip
had
thought
of
that
it
would
cost
at
least
fiveandtwenty
pounds
it
was
a
large
sum
to
him
he
was
willing
to
spend
his
last
penny
on
her
what
does
that
matter
say
youll
come
darling
what
next
i
should
like
to
know
i
cant
see
myself
going
away
with
a
man
that
i
wasnt
married
to
you
oughtnt
to
suggest
such
a
thing
what
does
it
matter
he
enlarged
on
the
glories
of
the
rue
de
la
paix
and
the
garish
splendour
of
the
folies
bergeres
he
described
the
louvre
and
the
bon
marche
he
told
her
about
the
cabaret
du
neant
the
abbaye
and
the
various
haunts
to
which
foreigners
go
he
painted
in
glowing
colours
the
side
of
paris
which
he
despised
he
pressed
her
to
come
with
him
you
know
you
say
you
love
me
but
if
you
really
loved
me
youd
want
to
marry
me
youve
never
asked
me
to
marry
you
you
know
i
cant
afford
it
after
all
im
in
my
first
year
i
shant
earn
a
penny
for
six
years
oh
im
not
blaming
you
i
wouldnt
marry
you
if
you
went
down
on
your
bended
knees
to
me
he
had
thought
of
marriage
more
than
once
but
it
was
a
step
from
which
he
shrank
in
paris
he
had
come
by
the
opinion
that
marriage
was
a
ridiculous
institution
of
the
philistines
he
knew
also
that
a
permanent
tie
would
ruin
him
he
had
middleclass
instincts
and
it
seemed
a
dreadful
thing
to
him
to
marry
a
waitress
a
common
wife
would
prevent
him
from
getting
a
decent
practice
besides
he
had
only
just
enough
money
to
last
him
till
he
was
qualified
he
could
not
keep
a
wife
even
if
they
arranged
not
to
have
children
he
thought
of
cronshaw
bound
to
a
vulgar
slattern
and
he
shuddered
with
dismay

he
foresaw
what
mildred
with
her
genteel
ideas
and
her
mean
mind
would
become
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
marry
her
but
he
decided
only
with
his
reason
he
felt
that
he
must
have
her
whatever
happened
and
if
he
could
not
get
her
without
marrying
her
he
would
do
that
the
future
could
look
after
itself
it
might
end
in
disaster
he
did
not
care
when
he
got
hold
of
an
idea
it
obsessed
him
he
could
think
of
nothing
else
and
he
had
a
more
than
common
power
to
persuade
himself
of
the
reasonableness
of
what
he
wished
to
do
he
found
himself
overthrowing
all
the
sensible
arguments
which
had
occurred
to
him
against
marriage
each
day
he
found
that
he
was
more
passionately
devoted
to
her
and
his
unsatisfied
love
became
angry
and
resentful
by
george
if
i
marry
her
ill
make
her
pay
for
all
the
suffering
ive
endured
he
said
to
himself
at
last
he
could
bear
the
agony
no
longer
after
dinner
one
evening
in
the
little
restaurant
in
soho
to
which
now
they
often
went
he
spoke
to
her
i
say
did
you
mean
it
the
other
day
that
you
wouldnt
marry
me
if
i
asked
you
yes
why
not
because
i
cant
live
without
you
i
want
you
with
me
always
ive
tried
to
get
over
it
and
i
cant
i
never
shall
now
i
want
you
to
marry
me
she
had
read
too
many
novelettes
not
to
know
how
to
take
such
an
offer
im
sure
im
very
grateful
to
you
philip
im
very
much
flattered
at
your
proposal
oh
dont
talk
rot
you
will
marry
me
wont
you
dyou
think
we
should
be
happy
no
but
what
does
that
matter
the
words
were
wrung
out
of
him
almost
against
his
will
they
surprised
her
well
you
are
a
funny
chap
why
dyou
want
to
marry
me
then
the
other
day
you
said
you
couldnt
afford
it
i
think
ive
got
about
fourteen
hundred
pounds
left
two
can
live
just
as
cheaply
as
one
thatll
keep
us
till
im
qualified
and
have
got
through
with
my
hospital
appointments
and
then
i
can
get
an
assistantship
it
means
you
wouldnt
be
able
to
earn
anything
for
six
years
we
should
have
about
four
pounds
a
week
to
live
on
till
then
shouldnt
we
not
much
more
than
three
there
are
all
my
fees
to
pay
and
what
would
you
get
as
an
assistant
three
pounds
a
week
dyou
mean
to
say
you
have
to
work
all
that
time
and
spend
a
small
fortune
just
to
earn
three
pounds
a
week
at
the
end
of
it
i
dont
see
that
i
should
be
any
better
off
than
i
am
now
he
was
silent
for
a
moment
dyou
mean
to
say
you
wont
marry
me
he
asked
hoarsely
does
my
great
love
mean
nothing
to
you
at
all
one
has
to
think
of
oneself
in
those
things
dont
one
i
shouldnt
mind
marrying
but
i
dont
want
to
marry
if
im
going
to
be
no
better
off
than
what
i
am
now
i
dont
see
the
use
of
it
if
you
cared
for
me
you
wouldnt
think
of
all
that
praps
not
he
was
silent
he
drank
a
glass
of
wine
in
order
to
get
rid
of
the
choking
in
his
throat
look
at
that
girl
whos
just
going
out
said
mildred
she
got
them
furs
at
the
bon
marche
at
brixton
i
saw
them
in
the
window
last
time
i
went
down
there
philip
smiled
grimly
what
are
you
laughing
at
she
asked
its
true
and
i
said
to
my
aunt
at
the
time
i
wouldnt
buy
anything
that
had
been
in
the
window
like
that
for
everyone
to
know
how
much
you
paid
for
it
i
cant
understand
you
you
make
me
frightfully
unhappy
and
in
the
next
breath
you
talk
rot
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
what
were
speaking
about
you
are
nasty
to
me
she
answered
aggrieved
i
cant
help
noticing
those
furs
because
i
said
to
my
aunt
i
dont
care
a
damn
what
you
said
to
your
aunt
he
interrupted
impatiently
i
wish
you
wouldnt
use
bad
language
when
you
speak
to
me
philip
you
know
i
dont
like
it
philip
smiled
a
little
but
his
eyes
were
wild
he
was
silent
for
a
while
he
looked
at
her
sullenly
he
hated
despised
and
loved
her
if
i
had
an
ounce
of
sense
id
never
see
you
again
he
said
at
last
if
you
only
knew
how
heartily
i
despise
myself
for
loving
you
thats
not
a
very
nice
thing
to
say
to
me
she
replied
sulkily
it
isnt
he
laughed
lets
go
to
the
pavilion
thats
whats
so
funny
in
you
you
start
laughing
just
when
one
doesnt
expect
you
to
and
if
i
make
you
that
unhappy
why
dyou
want
to
take
me
to
the
pavilion
im
quite
ready
to
go
home
merely
because
im
less
unhappy
with
you
than
away
from
you
i
should
like
to
know
what
you
really
think
of
me
he
laughed
outright
my
dear
if
you
did
youd
never
speak
to
me
again
chapter
lxiii
philip
did
not
pass
the
examination
in
anatomy
at
the
end
of
march
he
and
dunsford
had
worked
at
the
subject
together
on
philips
skeleton
asking
each
other
questions
till
both
knew
by
heart
every
attachment
and
the
meaning
of
every
nodule
and
groove
on
the
human
bones
but
in
the
examination
room
philip
was
seized
with
panic
and
failed
to
give
right
answers
to
questions
from
a
sudden
fear
that
they
might
be
wrong
he
knew
he
was
ploughed
and
did
not
even
trouble
to
go
up
to
the
building
next
day
to
see
whether
his
number
was
up
the
second
failure
put
him
definitely
among
the
incompetent
and
idle
men
of
his
year
he
did
not
care
much
he
had
other
things
to
think
of
he
told
himself
that
mildred
must
have
senses
like
anybody
else
it
was
only
a
question
of
awakening
them
he
had
theories
about
woman
the
rip
at
heart
and
thought
that
there
must
come
a
time
with
everyone
when
she
would
yield
to
persistence
it
was
a
question
of
watching
for
the
opportunity
keeping
his
temper
wearing
her
down
with
small
attentions
taking
advantage
of
the
physical
exhaustion
which
opened
the
heart
to
tenderness
making
himself
a
refuge
from
the
petty
vexations
of
her
work
he
talked
to
her
of
the
relations
between
his
friends
in
paris
and
the
fair
ladies
they
admired
the
life
he
described
had
a
charm
an
easy
gaiety
in
which
was
no
grossness
weaving
into
his
own
recollections
the
adventures
of
mimi
and
rodolphe
of
musette
and
the
rest
of
them
he
poured
into
mildreds
ears
a
story
of
poverty
made
picturesque
by
song
and
laughter
of
lawless
love
made
romantic
by
beauty
and
youth
he
never
attacked
her
prejudices
directly
but
sought
to
combat
them
by
the
suggestion
that
they
were
suburban
he
never
let
himself
be
disturbed
by
her
inattention
nor
irritated
by
her
indifference
he
thought
he
had
bored
her
by
an
effort
he
made
himself
affable
and
entertaining
he
never
let
himself
be
angry
he
never
asked
for
anything
he
never
complained
he
never
scolded
when
she
made
engagements
and
broke
them
he
met
her
next
day
with
a
smiling
face
when
she
excused
herself
he
said
it
did
not
matter
he
never
let
her
see
that
she
pained
him
he
understood
that
his
passionate
grief
had
wearied
her
and
he
took
care
to
hide
every
sentiment
which
could
be
in
the
least
degree
troublesome
he
was
heroic
though
she
never
mentioned
the
change
for
she
did
not
take
any
conscious
notice
of
it
it
affected
her
nevertheless
she
became
more
confidential
with
him
she
took
her
little
grievances
to
him
and
she
always
had
some
grievance
against
the
manageress
of
the
shop
one
of
her
fellow
waitresses
or
her
aunt
she
was
talkative
enough
now
and
though
she
never
said
anything
that
was
not
trivial
philip
was
never
tired
of
listening
to
her
i
like
you
when
you
dont
want
to
make
love
to
me
she
told
him
once
thats
flattering
for
me
he
laughed
she
did
not
realise
how
her
words
made
his
heart
sink
nor
what
an
effort
it
needed
for
him
to
answer
so
lightly
oh
i
dont
mind
your
kissing
me
now
and
then
it
doesnt
hurt
me
and
it
gives
you
pleasure
occasionally
she
went
so
far
as
to
ask
him
to
take
her
out
to
dinner
and
the
offer
coming
from
her
filled
him
with
rapture
i
wouldnt
do
it
to
anyone
else
she
said
by
way
of
apology
but
i
know
i
can
with
you
you
couldnt
give
me
greater
pleasure
he
smiled
she
asked
him
to
give
her
something
to
eat
one
evening
towards
the
end
of
april
all
right
he
said
where
would
you
like
to
go
afterwards
oh
dont
lets
go
anywhere
lets
just
sit
and
talk
you
dont
mind
do
you
rather
not
he
thought
she
must
be
beginning
to
care
for
him
three
months
before
the
thought
of
an
evening
spent
in
conversation
would
have
bored
her
to
death
it
was
a
fine
day
and
the
spring
added
to
philips
high
spirits
he
was
content
with
very
little
now
i
say
wont
it
be
ripping
when
the
summer
comes
along
he
said
as
they
drove
along
on
the
top
of
a
bus
to
sohoshe
had
herself
suggested
that
they
should
not
be
so
extravagant
as
to
go
by
cab
we
shall
be
able
to
spend
every
sunday
on
the
river
well
take
our
luncheon
in
a
basket
she
smiled
slightly
and
he
was
encouraged
to
take
her
hand
she
did
not
withdraw
it
i
really
think
youre
beginning
to
like
me
a
bit
he
smiled
you
are
silly
you
know
i
like
you
or
else
i
shouldnt
be
here
should
i
they
were
old
customers
at
the
little
restaurant
in
soho
by
now
and
the
patronne
gave
them
a
smile
as
they
came
in
the
waiter
was
obsequious
let
me
order
the
dinner
tonight
said
mildred
philip
thinking
her
more
enchanting
than
ever
gave
her
the
menu
and
she
chose
her
favourite
dishes
the
range
was
small
and
they
had
eaten
many
times
all
that
the
restaurant
could
provide
philip
was
gay
he
looked
into
her
eyes
and
he
dwelt
on
every
perfection
of
her
pale
cheek
when
they
had
finished
mildred
by
way
of
exception
took
a
cigarette
she
smoked
very
seldom
i
dont
like
to
see
a
lady
smoking
she
said
she
hesitated
a
moment
and
then
spoke
were
you
surprised
my
asking
you
to
take
me
out
and
give
me
a
bit
of
dinner
tonight
i
was
delighted
ive
got
something
to
say
to
you
philip
he
looked
at
her
quickly
his
heart
sank
but
he
had
trained
himself
well
well
fire
away
he
said
smiling
youre
not
going
to
be
silly
about
it
are
you
the
fact
is
im
going
to
get
married
are
you
said
philip
he
could
think
of
nothing
else
to
say
he
had
considered
the
possibility
often
and
had
imagined
to
himself
what
he
would
do
and
say
he
had
suffered
agonies
when
he
thought
of
the
despair
he
would
suffer
he
had
thought
of
suicide
of
the
mad
passion
of
anger
that
would
seize
him
but
perhaps
he
had
too
completely
anticipated
the
emotion
he
would
experience
so
that
now
he
felt
merely
exhausted
he
felt
as
one
does
in
a
serious
illness
when
the
vitality
is
so
low
that
one
is
indifferent
to
the
issue
and
wants
only
to
be
left
alone
you
see
im
getting
on
she
said
im
twentyfour
and
its
time
i
settled
down
he
was
silent
he
looked
at
the
patronne
sitting
behind
the
counter
and
his
eye
dwelt
on
a
red
feather
one
of
the
diners
wore
in
her
hat
mildred
was
nettled
you
might
congratulate
me
she
said
i
might
mightnt
i
i
can
hardly
believe
its
true
ive
dreamt
it
so
often
it
rather
tickles
me
that
i
should
have
been
so
jolly
glad
that
you
asked
me
to
take
you
out
to
dinner
whom
are
you
going
to
marry
miller
she
answered
with
a
slight
blush
miller
cried
philip
astounded
but
youve
not
seen
him
for
months
he
came
in
to
lunch
one
day
last
week
and
asked
me
then
hes
earning
very
good
money
he
makes
seven
pounds
a
week
now
and
hes
got
prospects
philip
was
silent
again
he
remembered
that
she
had
always
liked
miller
he
amused
her
there
was
in
his
foreign
birth
an
exotic
charm
which
she
felt
unconsciously
i
suppose
it
was
inevitable
he
said
at
last
you
were
bound
to
accept
the
highest
bidder
when
are
you
going
to
marry
on
saturday
next
i
have
given
notice
philip
felt
a
sudden
pang
as
soon
as
that
were
going
to
be
married
at
a
registry
office
emil
prefers
it
philip
felt
dreadfully
tired
he
wanted
to
get
away
from
her
he
thought
he
would
go
straight
to
bed
he
called
for
the
bill
ill
put
you
in
a
cab
and
send
you
down
to
victoria

daresay

wont
have
to

she
answered
haughtily
i
suppose

teatime
tomorrow

i
think
wed

a
full
stop

unhappy
ive

the
cab
he
nodded
to
her
and
forced
a
smile
on
his
lips
then
jumped
on
a
bus
and
made
his
way
home
he
smoked
a
pipe
before
he
went
to
bed
but
he
could
hardly
keep
his
eyes
open
he
suffered
no
pain
he
fell
into
a
heavy
sleep
almost
as
soon
as
his
head
touched
the
pillow
chapter
lxiv
but
about
three
in
the
morning
philip
awoke
and
could
not
sleep
again
he
began
to
think
of
mildred
he
tried
not
to
but
could
not
help
himself
he
repeated
to
himself
the
same
thing
time
after
time
till
his
brain
reeled
it
was
inevitable
that
she
should
marry
life
was
hard
for
a
girl
who
had
to
earn
her
own
living
and
if
she
found
someone
who
could
give
her
a
comfortable
home
she
should
not
be
blamed
if
she
accepted
philip
acknowledged
that
from
her
point
of
view
it
would
have
been
madness
to
marry
him
only
love
could
have
made
such
poverty
bearable
and
she
did
not
love
him
it
was
no
fault
of
hers
it
was
a
fact
that
must
be
accepted
like
any
other
philip
tried
to
reason
with
himself
he
told
himself
that
deep
down
in
his
heart
was
mortified
pride
his
passion
had
begun
in
wounded
vanity
and
it
was
this
at
bottom
which
caused
now
a
great
part
of
his
wretchedness
he
despised
himself
as
much
as
he
despised
her
then
he
made
plans
for
the
future
the
same
plans
over
and
over
again
interrupted
by
recollections
of
kisses
on
her
soft
pale
cheek
and
by
the
sound
of
her
voice
with
its
trailing
accent
he
had
a
great
deal
of
work
to
do
since
in
the
summer
he
was
taking
chemistry
as
well
as
the
two
examinations
he
had
failed
in
he
had
separated
himself
from
his
friends
at
the
hospital
but
now
he
wanted
companionship
there
was
one
happy
occurrence
hayward
a
fortnight
before
had
written
to
say
that
he
was
passing
through
london
and
had
asked
him
to
dinner
but
philip
unwilling
to
be
bothered
had
refused
he
was
coming
back
for
the
season
and
philip
made
up
his
mind
to
write
to
him
he
was
thankful
when
eight
oclock
struck
and
he
could
get
up
he
was
pale
and
weary
but
when
he
had
bathed
dressed
and
had
breakfast
he
felt
himself
joined
up
again
with
the
world
at
large
and
his
pain
was
a
little
easier
to
bear
he
did
not
feel
like
going
to
lectures
that
morning
but
went
instead
to
the
army
and
navy
stores
to
buy
mildred
a
weddingpresent
after
much
wavering
he
settled
on
a
dressingbag
it
cost
twenty
pounds
which
was
much
more
than
he
could
afford
but
it
was
showy
and
vulgar
he
knew
she
would
be
aware
exactly
how
much
it
cost
he
got
a
melancholy
satisfaction
in
choosing
a
gift
which
would
give
her
pleasure
and
at
the
same
time
indicate
for
himself
the
contempt
he
had
for
her
philip
had
looked
forward
with
apprehension
to
the
day
on
which
mildred
was
to
be
married
he
was
expecting
an
intolerable
anguish
and
it
was
with
relief
that
he
got
a
letter
from
hayward
on
saturday
morning
to
say
that
he
was
coming
up
early
on
that
very
day
and
would
fetch
philip
to
help
him
to
find
rooms
philip
anxious
to
be
distracted
looked
up
a
timetable
and
discovered
the
only
train
hayward
was
likely
to
come
by
he
went
to
meet
him
and
the
reunion
of
the
friends
was
enthusiastic
they
left
the
luggage
at
the
station
and
set
off
gaily
hayward
characteristically
proposed
that
first
of
all
they
should
go
for
an
hour
to
the
national
gallery
he
had
not
seen
pictures
for
some
time
and
he
stated
that
it
needed
a
glimpse
to
set
him
in
tune
with
life
philip
for
months
had
had
no
one
with
whom
he
could
talk
of
art
and
books
since
the
paris
days
hayward
had
immersed
himself
in
the
modern
french
versifiers
and
such
a
plethora
of
poets
is
there
in
france
he
had
several
new
geniuses
to
tell
philip
about
they
walked
through
the
gallery
pointing
out
to
one
another
their
favourite
pictures
one
subject
led
to
another
they
talked
excitedly
the
sun
was
shining
and
the
air
was
warm
lets
go
and
sit
in
the
park
said
hayward
well
look
for
rooms
after
luncheon
the
spring
was
pleasant
there
it
was
a
day
upon
which
one
felt
it
good
merely
to
live
the
young
green
of
the
trees
was
exquisite
against
the
sky
and
the
sky
pale
and
blue
was
dappled
with
little
white
clouds
at
the
end
of
the
ornamental
water
was
the
gray
mass
of
the
horse
guards
the
ordered
elegance
of
the
scene
had
the
charm
of
an
eighteenthcentury
picture
it
reminded
you
not
of
watteau
whose
landscapes
are
so
idyllic
that
they
recall
only
the
woodland
glens
seen
in
dreams
but
of
the
more
prosaic
jeanbaptiste
pater
philips
heart
was
filled
with
lightness
he
realised
what
he
had
only
read
before
that
art
for
there
was
art
in
the
manner
in
which
he
looked
upon
nature
might
liberate
the
soul
from
pain
they
went
to
an
italian
restaurant
for
luncheon
and
ordered
themselves
a
fiaschetto
of
chianti
lingering
over
the
meal
they
talked
on
they
reminded
one
another
of
the
people
they
had
known
at
heidelberg
they
spoke
of
philips
friends
in
paris
they
talked
of
books
pictures
morals
life
and
suddenly
philip
heard
a
clock
strike
three
he
remembered
that
by
this
time
mildred
was
married
he
felt
a
sort
of
stitch
in
his
heart
and
for
a
minute
or
two
he
could
not
hear
what
hayward
was
saying
but
he
filled
his
glass
with
chianti
he
was
unaccustomed
to
alcohol
and
it
had
gone
to
his
head
for
the
time
at
all
events
he
was
free
from
care
his
quick
brain
had
lain
idle
for
so
many
months
that
he
was
intoxicated
now
with
conversation
he
was
thankful
to
have
someone
to
talk
to
who
would
interest
himself
in
the
things
that
interested
him
i
say
dont
lets
waste
this
beautiful
day
in
looking
for
rooms
ill
put
you
up
tonight
you
can
look
for
rooms
tomorrow
or
monday
all
right
what
shall
we
do
answered
hayward
lets
get
on
a
penny
steamboat
and
go
down
to
greenwich
the
idea
appealed
to
hayward
and
they
jumped
into
a
cab
which
took
them
to
westminster
bridge
they
got
on
the
steamboat
just
as
she
was
starting
presently
philip
a
smile
on
his
lips
spoke
i
remember
when
first
i
went
to
paris
clutton
i
think
it
was
gave
a
long
discourse
on
the
subject
that
beauty
is
put
into
things
by
painters
and
poets
they
create
beauty
in
themselves
there
is
nothing
to
choose
between
the
campanile
of
giotto
and
a
factory
chimney
and
then
beautiful
things
grow
rich
with
the
emotion
that
they
have
aroused
in
succeeding
generations
that
is
why
old
things
are
more
beautiful
than
modern
the
ode
on
a
grecian
urn
is
more
lovely
now
than
when
it
was
written
because
for
a
hundred
years
lovers
have
read
it
and
the
sick
at
heart
taken
comfort
in
its
lines
philip
left
hayward
to
infer
what
in
the
passing
scene
had
suggested
these
words
to
him
and
it
was
a
delight
to
know
that
he
could
safely
leave
the
inference
it
was
in
sudden
reaction
from
the
life
he
had
been
leading
for
so
long
that
he
was
now
deeply
affected
the
delicate
iridescence
of
the
london
air
gave
the
softness
of
a
pastel
to
the
gray
stone
of
the
buildings
and
in
the
wharfs
and
storehouses
there
was
the
severity
of
grace
of
a
japanese
print
they
went
further
down
and
the
splendid
channel
a
symbol
of
the
great
empire
broadened
and
it
was
crowded
with
traffic
philip
thought
of
the
painters
and
the
poets
who
had
made
all
these
things
so
beautiful
and
his
heart
was
filled
with
gratitude
they
came
to
the
pool
of
london
and
who
can
describe
its
majesty
the
imagination
thrills
and
heaven
knows
what
figures
people
still
its

the

and

philip
turned
to
hayward
with
shining
eyes
dear
charles
dickens
he
murmured
smiling
a
little
at
his
own
emotion
arent
you
rather
sorry
you
chucked
painting
asked
hayward
no
i
suppose
you
like
doctoring
no
i
hate
it
but
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
the
drudgery
of
the
first
two
years
is
awful
and
unfortunately
i
havent
got
the
scientific
temperament
well
you
cant
go
on
changing
professions
oh
no
im
going
to
stick
to
this
i
think
i
shall
like
it
better
when
i
get
into
the
wards
i
have
an
idea
that
im
more
interested
in
people
than
in
anything
else
in
the
world
and
as
far
as
i
can
see
its
the
only
profession
in
which
you
have
your
freedom
you
carry
your
knowledge
in
your
head
with
a
box
of
instruments
and
a
few
drugs
you
can
make
your
living
anywhere
arent
you
going
to
take
a
practice
then
not
for
a
good
long
time
at
any
rate
philip
answered
as
soon
as
ive
got
through
my
hospital
appointments
i
shall
get
a
ship
i
want
to
go
to
the
eastthe
malay
archipelago
siam
china
and
all
that
sort
of
thingand
then
i
shall
take
odd
jobs
something
always
comes
along
cholera
duty
in
india
and
things
like
that
i
want
to
go
from
place
to
place
i
want
to
see
the
world
the
only
way
a
poor
man
can
do
that
is
by
going
in
for
the
medical
they
came
to
greenwich
then
the
noble
building
of
inigo
jones
faced
the
river
grandly
i
say
look
that
must
be
the
place
where
poor
jack
dived
into
the
mud
for
pennies
said
philip
they
wandered
in
the
park
ragged
children
were
playing
in
it
and
it
was
noisy
with
their
cries
here
and
there
old
seamen
were
basking
in
the
sun
there
was
an
air
of
a
hundred
years
ago
it
seems
a
pity
you
wasted
two
years
in
paris
said
hayward
waste
look
at
the
movement
of
that
child
look
at
the
pattern
which
the
sun
makes
on
the
ground
shining
through
the
trees
look
at
that
skywhy
i
should
never
have
seen
that
sky
if
i
hadnt
been
to
paris
hayward
thought
that
philip
choked
a
sob
and
he
looked
at
him
with
astonishment
whats
the
matter
with
you
nothing
im
sorry
to
be
so
damned
emotional
but
for
six
months
ive
been
starved
for
beauty
you
used
to
be
so
matter
of
fact
its
very
interesting
to
hear
you
say
that
damn
it
all
i
dont
want
to
be
interesting
laughed
philip
lets
go
and
have
a
stodgy
tea
chapter
lxv
haywards
visit
did
philip
a
great
deal
of
good
each
day
his
thoughts
dwelt
less
on
mildred
he
looked
back
upon
the
past
with
disgust
he
could
not
understand
how
he
had
submitted
to
the
dishonour
of
such
a
love
and
when
he
thought
of
mildred
it
was
with
angry
hatred
because
she
had
submitted
him
to
so
much
humiliation
his
imagination
presented
her
to
him
now
with
her
defects
of
person
and
manner
exaggerated
so
that
he
shuddered
at
the
thought
of
having
been
connected
with
her
it
just
shows
how
damned
weak
i
am
he
said
to
himself
the
adventure
was
like
a
blunder
that
one
had
committed
at
a
party
so
horrible
that
one
felt
nothing
could
be
done
to
excuse
it
the
only
remedy
was
to
forget
his
horror
at
the
degradation
he
had
suffered
helped
him
he
was
like
a
snake
casting
its
skin
and
he
looked
upon
the
old
covering
with
nausea
he
exulted
in
the
possession
of
himself
once
more
he
realised
how
much
of
the
delight
of
the
world
he
had
lost
when
he
was
absorbed
in
that
madness
which
they
called
love
he
had
had
enough
of
it
he
did
not
want
to
be
in
love
any
more
if
love
was
that
philip
told
hayward
something
of
what
he
had
gone
through
wasnt
it
sophocles
he
asked
who
prayed
for
the
time
when
he
would
be
delivered
from
the
wild
beast
of
passion
that
devoured
his
heartstrings
philip
seemed
really
to
be
born
again
he
breathed
the
circumambient
air
as
though
he
had
never
breathed
it
before
and
he
took
a
childs
pleasure
in
all
the
facts
of
the
world
he
called
his
period
of
insanity
six
months
hard
labour
hayward
had
only
been
settled
in
london
a
few
days
when
philip
received
from
blackstable
where
it
had
been
sent
a
card
for
a
private
view
at
some
picture
gallery
he
took
hayward
and
on
looking
at
the
catalogue
saw
that
lawson
had
a
picture
in
it
i
suppose
he
sent
the
card
said
philip
lets
go
and
find
him
hes
sure
to
be
in
front
of
his
picture
this
a
profile
of
ruth
chalice
was
tucked
away
in
a
corner
and
lawson
was
not
far
from
it
he
looked
a
little
lost
in
his
large
soft
hat
and
loose
pale
clothes
amongst
the
fashionable
throng
that
had
gathered
for
the
private
view
he
greeted
philip
with
enthusiasm
and
with
his
usual
volubility
told
him
that
he
had
come
to
live
in
london
ruth
chalice
was
a
hussy
he
had
taken
a
studio
paris
was
played
out
he
had
a
commission
for
a
portrait
and
theyd
better
dine
together
and
have
a
good
old
talk
philip
reminded
him
of
his
acquaintance
with
hayward
and
was
entertained
to
see
that
lawson
was
slightly
awed
by
haywards
elegant
clothes
and
grand
manner
they
sat
upon
him
better
than
they
had
done
in
the
shabby
little
studio
which
lawson
and
philip
had
shared
at
dinner
lawson
went
on
with
his
news
flanagan
had
gone
back
to
america
clutton
had
disappeared
he
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
a
man
had
no
chance
of
doing
anything
so
long
as
he
was
in
contact
with
art
and
artists
the
only
thing
was
to
get
right
away
to
make
the
step
easier
he
had
quarrelled
with
all
his
friends
in
paris
he
developed
a
talent
for
telling
them
home
truths
which
made
them
bear
with
fortitude
his
declaration
that
he
had
done
with
that
city
and
was
settling
in
gerona
a
little
town
in
the
north
of
spain
which
had
attracted
him
when
he
saw
it
from
the
train
on
his
way
to
barcelona
he
was
living
there
now
alone
i
wonder
if
hell
ever
do
any
good
said
philip
he
was
interested
in
the
human
side
of
that
struggle
to
express
something
which
was
so
obscure
in
the
mans
mind
that
he
was
become
morbid
and
querulous
philip
felt
vaguely
that
he
was
himself
in
the
same
case
but
with
him
it
was
the
conduct
of
his
life
as
a
whole
that
perplexed
him
that
was
his
means
of
selfexpression
and
what
he
must
do
with
it
was
not
clear
but
he
had
no
time
to
continue
with
this
train
of
thought
for
lawson
poured
out
a
frank
recital
of
his
affair
with
ruth
chalice
she
had
left
him
for
a
young
student
who
had
just
come
from
england
and
was
behaving
in
a
scandalous
fashion
lawson
really
thought
someone
ought
to
step
in
and
save
the
young
man
she
would
ruin
him
philip
gathered
that
lawsons
chief
grievance
was
that
the
rupture
had
come
in
the
middle
of
a
portrait
he
was
painting
women
have
no
real
feeling
for
art
he
said
they
only
pretend
they
have
but
he
finished
philosophically
enough
however
i
got
four
portraits
out
of
her
and
im
not
sure
if
the
last
i
was
working
on
would
ever
have
been
a
success
philip
envied
the
easy
way
in
which
the
painter
managed
his
love
affairs
he
had
passed
eighteen
months
pleasantly
enough
had
got
an
excellent
model
for
nothing
and
had
parted
from
her
at
the
end
with
no
great
pang
and
what
about
cronshaw
asked
philip
oh
hes
done
for
answered
lawson
with
the
cheerful
callousness
of
his
youth
hell
be
dead
in
six
months
he
got
pneumonia
last
winter
he
was
in
the
english
hospital
for
seven
weeks
and
when
he
came
out
they
told
him
his
only
chance
was
to
give
up
liquor
poor
devil
smiled
the
abstemious
philip
he
kept
off
for
a
bit
he
used
to
go
to
the
lilas
all
the
same
he
couldnt
keep
away
from
that
but
he
used
to
drink
hot
milk
avec
de
la
fleur
doranger
and
he
was
damned
dull
i
take
it
you
did
not
conceal
the
fact
from
him
oh
he
knew
it
himself
a
little
while
ago
he
started
on
whiskey
again
he
said
he
was
too
old
to
turn
over
any
new
leaves
he
would
rather
be
happy
for
six
months
and
die
at
the
end
of
it
than
linger
on
for
five
years
and
then
i
think
hes
been
awfully
hard
up
lately
you
see
he
didnt
earn
anything
while
he
was
ill
and
the
slut
he
lives
with
has
been
giving
him
a
rotten
time
i
remember
the
first
time
i
saw
him
i
admired
him
awfully
said
philip
i
thought
he
was
wonderful
it
is
sickening
that
vulgar
middleclass
virtue
should
pay
of
course
he
was
a
rotter
he
was
bound
to
end
in
the
gutter
sooner
or
later
said
lawson
philip
was
hurt
because
lawson
would
not
see
the
pity
of
it
of
course
it
was
cause
and
effect
but
in
the
necessity
with
which
one
follows
the
other
lay
all
tragedy
of
life
oh
i
d
forgotten
said
lawson
just
after
you
left
he
sent
round
a
present
for
you
i
thought
youd
be
coming
back
and
i
didnt
bother
about
it
and
then
i
didnt
think
it
worth
sending
on
but
itll
come
over
to
london
with
the
rest
of
my
things
and
you
can
come
to
my
studio
one
day
and
fetch
it
away
if
you
want
it
you
havent
told
me
what
it
is
yet
oh
its
only
a
ragged
little
bit
of
carpet
i
shouldnt
think
its
worth
anything
i
asked
him
one
day
what
the
devil
hed
sent
the
filthy
thing
for
he
told
me
hed
seen
it
in
a
shop
in
the
rue
de
rennes
and
bought
it
for
fifteen
francs
it
appears
to
be
a
persian
rug
he
said
youd
asked
him
the
meaning
of
life
and
that
was
the
answer
but
he
was
very
drunk
philip
laughed
oh
yes
i
know
ill
take
it
it
was
a
favourite
wheeze
of
his
he
said
i
must
find
out
for
myself
or
else
the
answer
meant
nothing
chapter
lxvi
philip
worked
well
and
easily
he
had
a
good
deal
to
do
since
he
was
taking
in
july
the
three
parts
of
the
first
conjoint
examination
two
of
which
he
had
failed
in
before
but
he
found
life
pleasant
he
made
a
new
friend
lawson
on
the
lookout
for
models
had
discovered
a
girl
who
was
understudying
at
one
of
the
theatres
and
in
order
to
induce
her
to
sit
to
him
arranged
a
little
luncheonparty
one
sunday
she
brought
a
chaperon
with
her
and
to
her
philip
asked
to
make
a
fourth
was
instructed
to
confine
his
attentions
he
found
this
easy
since
she
turned
out
to
be
an
agreeable
chatterbox
with
an
amusing
tongue
she
asked
philip
to
go
and
see
her
she
had
rooms
in
vincent
square
and
was
always
in
to
tea
at
five
oclock
he
went
was
delighted
with
his
welcome
and
went
again
mrs
nesbit
was
not
more
than
twentyfive
very
small
with
a
pleasant
ugly
face
she
had
very
bright
eyes
high
cheekbones
and
a
large
mouth
the
excessive
contrasts
of
her
colouring
reminded
one
of
a
portrait
by
one
of
the
modern
french
painters
her
skin
was
very
white
her
cheeks
were
very
red
her
thick
eyebrows
her
hair
were
very
black
the
effect
was
odd
a
little
unnatural
but
far
from
unpleasing
she
was
separated
from
her
husband
and
earned
her
living
and
her
childs
by
writing
penny
novelettes
there
were
one
or
two
publishers
who
made
a
specialty
of
that
sort
of
thing
and
she
had
as
much
work
as
she
could
do
it
was
illpaid
she
received
fifteen
pounds
for
a
story
of
thirty
thousand
words
but
she
was
satisfied
after
all
it
only
costs
the
reader
twopence
she
said
and
they
like
the
same
thing
over
and
over
again
i
just
change
the
names
and
thats
all
when
im
bored
i
think
of
the
washing
and
the
rent
and
clothes
for
baby
and
i
go
on
again
besides
she
walked
on
at
various
theatres
where
they
wanted
supers
and
earned
by
this
when
in
work
from
sixteen
shillings
to
a
guinea
a
week
at
the
end
of
her
day
she
was
so
tired
that
she
slept
like
a
top
she
made
the
best
of
her
difficult
lot
her
keen
sense
of
humour
enabled
her
to
get
amusement
out
of
every
vexatious
circumstance
sometimes
things
went
wrong
and
she
found
herself
with
no
money
at
all
then
her
trifling
possessions
found
their
way
to
a
pawnshop
in
the
vauxhall
bridge
road
and
she
ate
bread
and
butter
till
things
grew
brighter
she
never
lost
her
cheerfulness
philip
was
interested
in
her
shiftless
life
and
she
made
him
laugh
with
the
fantastic
narration
of
her
struggles
he
asked
her
why
she
did
not
try
her
hand
at
literary
work
of
a
better
sort
but
she
knew
that
she
had
no
talent
and
the
abominable
stuff
she
turned
out
by
the
thousand
words
was
not
only
tolerably
paid
but
was
the
best
she
could
do
she
had
nothing
to
look
forward
to
but
a
continuation
of
the
life
she
led
she
seemed
to
have
no
relations
and
her
friends
were
as
poor
as
herself
i
dont
think
of
the
future
she
said
as
long
as
i
have
enough
money
for
three
weeks
rent
and
a
pound
or
two
over
for
food
i
never
bother
life
wouldnt
be
worth
living
if
i
worried
over
the
future
as
well
as
the
present
when
things
are
at
their
worst
i
find
something
always
happens
soon
philip
grew
in
the
habit
of
going
in
to
tea
with
her
every
day
and
so
that
his
visits
might
not
embarrass
her
he
took
in
a
cake
or
a
pound
of
butter
or
some
tea
they
started
to
call
one
another
by
their
christian
names
feminine
sympathy
was
new
to
him
and
he
delighted
in
someone
who
gave
a
willing
ear
to
all
his
troubles
the
hours
went
quickly
he
did
not
hide
his
admiration
for
her
she
was
a
delightful
companion
he
could
not
help
comparing
her
with
mildred
and
he
contrasted
with
the
ones
obstinate
stupidity
which
refused
interest
to
everything
she
did
not
know
the
others
quick
appreciation
and
ready
intelligence
his
heart
sank
when
he
thought
that
he
might
have
been
tied
for
life
to
such
a
woman
as
mildred
one
evening
he
told
norah
the
whole
story
of
his
love
it
was
not
one
to
give
him
much
reason
for
selfesteem
and
it
was
very
pleasant
to
receive
such
charming
sympathy
i
think
youre
well
out
of
it
she
said
when
he
had
finished
she
had
a
funny
way
at
times
of
holding
her
head
on
one
side
like
an
aberdeen
puppy
she
was
sitting
in
an
upright
chair
sewing
for
she
had
no
time
to
do
nothing
and
philip
had
made
himself
comfortable
at
her
feet
i
cant
tell
you
how
heartily
thankful
i
am
its
all
over
he
sighed
poor
thing
you
must
have
had
a
rotten
time
she
murmured
and
by
way
of
showing
her
sympathy
put
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
he
took
it
and
kissed
it
but
she
withdrew
it
quickly
why
did
you
do
that
she
asked
with
a
blush
have
you
any
objection
she
looked
at
him
for
a
moment
with
twinkling
eyes
and
she
smiled
no
she
said
he
got
up
on
his
knees
and
faced
her
she
looked
into
his
eyes
steadily
and
her
large
mouth
trembled
with
a
smile
well
she
said
you
know
you
are
a
ripper
im
so
grateful
to
you
for
being
nice
to
me
i
like
you
so
much
dont
be
idiotic
she
said
philip
took
hold
of
her
elbows
and
drew
her
towards
him
she
made
no
resistance
but
bent
forward
a
little
and
he
kissed
her
red
lips
why
did
you
do
that
she
asked
again
because
its
comfortable
she
did
not
answer
but
a
tender
look
came
into
her
eyes
and
she
passed
her
hand
softly
over
his
hair
you
know
its
awfully
silly
of
you
to
behave
like
this
we
were
such
good
friends
it
would
be
so
jolly
to
leave
it
at
that
if
you
really
want
to
appeal
to
my
better
nature
replied
philip
youll
do
well
not
to
stroke
my
cheek
while
youre
doing
it
she
gave
a
little
chuckle
but
she
did
not
stop
its
very
wrong
of
me
isnt
it
she
said
philip
surprised
and
a
little
amused
looked
into
her
eyes
and
as
he
looked
he
saw
them
soften
and
grow
liquid
and
there
was
an
expression
in
them
that
enchanted
him
his
heart
was
suddenly
stirred
and
tears
came
to
his
eyes
norah
youre
not
fond
of
me
are
you
he
asked
incredulously
you
clever
boy
you
ask
such
stupid
questions
oh
my
dear
it
never
struck
me
that
you
could
be
he
flung
his
arms
round
her
and
kissed
her
while
she
laughing
blushing
and
crying
surrendered
herself
willingly
to
his
embrace
presently
he
released
her
and
sitting
back
on
his
heels
looked
at
her
curiously
well
im
blowed
he
said
why
im
so
surprised
and
pleased
delighted
he
cried
with
all
his
heart
and
so
proud
and
so
happy
and
so
grateful
he
took
her
hands
and
covered
them
with
kisses
this
was
the
beginning
for
philip
of
a
happiness
which
seemed
both
solid
and
durable
they
became
lovers
but
remained
friends
there
was
in
norah
a
maternal
instinct
which
received
satisfaction
in
her
love
for
philip
she
wanted
someone
to
pet
and
scold
and
make
a
fuss
of
she
had
a
domestic
temperament
and
found
pleasure
in
looking
after
his
health
and
his
linen
she
pitied
his
deformity
over
which
he
was
so
sensitive
and
her
pity
expressed
itself
instinctively
in
tenderness
she
was
young
strong
and
healthy
and
it
seemed
quite
natural
to
her
to
give
her
love
she
had
high
spirits
and
a
merry
soul
she
liked
philip
because
he
laughed
with
her
at
all
the
amusing
things
in
life
that
caught
her
fancy
and
above
all
she
liked
him
because
he
was
he
when
she
told
him
this
he
answered
gaily
nonsense
you
like
me
because
im
a
silent
person
and
never
want
to
get
a
word
in
philip
did
not
love
her
at
all
he
was
extremely
fond
of
her
glad
to
be
with
her
amused
and
interested
by
her
conversation
she
restored
his
belief
in
himself
and
put
healing
ointments
as
it
were
on
all
the
bruises
of
his
soul
he
was
immensely
flattered
that
she
cared
for
him
he
admired
her
courage
her
optimism
her
impudent
defiance
of
fate
she
had
a
little
philosophy
of
her
own
ingenuous
and
practical
you
know
i
dont
believe
in
churches
and
parsons
and
all
that
she
said
but
i
believe
in
god
and
i
dont
believe
he
minds
much
about
what
you
do
as
long
as
you
keep
your
end
up
and
help
a
lame
dog
over
a
stile
when
you
can
and
i
think
people
on
the
whole
are
very
nice
and
im
sorry
for
those
who
arent
and
what
about
afterwards
asked
philip
oh
well
i
dont
know
for
certain
you
know
she
smiled
but
i
hope
for
the
best
and
anyhow
therell
be
no
rent
to
pay
and
no
novelettes
to
write
she
had
a
feminine
gift
for
delicate
flattery
she
thought
that
philip
did
a
brave
thing
when
he
left
paris
because
he
was
conscious
he
could
not
be
a
great
artist
and
he
was
enchanted
when
she
expressed
enthusiastic
admiration
for
him
he
had
never
been
quite
certain
whether
this
action
indicated
courage
or
infirmity
of
purpose
it
was
delightful
to
realise
that
she
considered
it
heroic
she
ventured
to
tackle
him
on
a
subject
which
his
friends
instinctively
avoided
its
very
silly
of
you
to
be
so
sensitive
about
your
clubfoot
she
said
she
saw
him
bush
darkly
but
went
on
you
know
people
dont
think
about
it
nearly
as
much
as
you
do
they
notice
it
the
first
time
they
see
you
and
then
they
forget
about
it
he
would
not
answer
youre
not
angry
with
me
are
you
no
she
put
her
arm
round
his
neck
you
know
i
only
speak
about
it
because
i
love
you
i
dont
want
it
to
make
you
unhappy
i
think
you
can
say
anything
you
choose
to
me
he
answered
smiling
i
wish
i
could
do
something
to
show
you
how
grateful
i
am
to
you
she
took
him
in
hand
in
other
ways
she
would
not
let
him
be
bearish
and
laughed
at
him
when
he
was
out
of
temper
she
made
him
more
urbane
you
can
make
me
do
anything
you
like
he
said
to
her
once
dyou
mind
no
i
want
to
do
what
you
like
he
had
the
sense
to
realise
his
happiness
it
seemed
to
him
that
she
gave
him
all
that
a
wife
could
and
he
preserved
his
freedom
she
was
the
most
charming
friend
he
had
ever
had
with
a
sympathy
that
he
had
never
found
in
a
man
the
sexual
relationship
was
no
more
than
the
strongest
link
in
their
friendship
it
completed
it
but
was
not
essential
and
because
philips
appetites
were
satisfied
he
became
more
equable
and
easier
to
live
with
he
felt
in
complete
possession
of
himself
he
thought
sometimes
of
the
winter
during
which
he
had
been
obsessed
by
a
hideous
passion
and
he
was
filled
with
loathing
for
mildred
and
with
horror
of
himself
his
examinations
were
approaching
and
norah
was
as
interested
in
them
as
he
he
was
flattered
and
touched
by
her
eagerness
she
made
him
promise
to
come
at
once
and
tell
her
the
results
he
passed
the
three
parts
this
time
without
mishap
and
when
he
went
to
tell
her
she
burst
into
tears
oh
im
so
glad
i
was
so
anxious
you
silly
little
thing
he
laughed
but
he
was
choking
no
one
could
help
being
pleased
with
the
way
she
took
it
and
what
are
you
going
to
do
now
she
asked
i
can
take
a
holiday
with
a
clear
conscience
i
have
no
work
to
do
till
the
winter
session
begins
in
october
i
suppose
youll
go
down
to
your
uncles
at
blackstable
you
suppose
quite
wrong
im
going
to
stay
in
london
and
play
with
you
id
rather
you
went
away
why
are
you
tired
of
me
she
laughed
and
put
her
hands
on
his
shoulders
because
youve
been
working
hard
and
you
look
utterly
washed
out
you
want
some
fresh
air
and
a
rest
please
go
he
did
not
answer
for
a
moment
he
looked
at
her
with
loving
eyes
you
know
id
never
believe
it
of
anyone
but
you
youre
only
thinking
of
my
good
i
wonder
what
you
see
in
me
will
you
give
me
a
good
character
with
my
months
notice
she
laughed
gaily
ill
say
that
youre
thoughtful
and
kind
and
youre
not
exacting
you
never
worry
youre
not
troublesome
and
youre
easy
to
please
all
thats
nonsense
she
said
but
ill
tell
you
one
thing
im
one
of
the
few
persons
i
ever
met
who
are
able
to
learn
from
experience
chapter

philip
looked
forward
to

impatience

two
months

to
him
frequently
long
letters
in
a
bold
large
hand
in
which
with
cheerful
humour
she
described
the
little
events
of
the
daily
round
the
domestic
troubles
of
her
landlady
rich
food
for
laughter
the
comic
vexations
of
her
rehearsalsshe
was
walking
on
in
an
important
spectacle
at
one
of
the
london
theatresand
her
odd
adventures
with
the
publishers
of
novelettes
philip
read
a
great
deal
bathed
played
tennis
and
sailed
at
the
beginning
of
october
he
settled
down
in
london
to
work
for
the
second
conjoint
examination
he
was
eager
to
pass
it
since
that
ended
the
drudgery
of
the
curriculum
after
it
was
done
with
the
student
became
an
outpatients
clerk
and
was
brought
in
contact
with
men
and
women
as
well
as
with
textbooks
philip
saw
norah
every
day
lawson
had
been
spending
the
summer
at
poole
and
had
a
number
of
sketches
to
show
of
the
harbour
and
of
the
beach
he
had
a
couple
of
commissions
for
portraits
and
proposed
to
stay
in
london
till
the
bad
light
drove
him
away
hayward
in
london
too
intended
to
spend
the
winter
abroad
but
remained
week
after
week
from
sheer
inability
to
make
up
his
mind
to
go
hayward
had
run
to
fat
during
the
last
two
or
three
yearsit
was
five
years
since
philip
first
met
him
in
heidelbergand
he
was
prematurely
bald
he
was
very
sensitive
about
it
and
wore
his
hair
long
to
conceal
the
unsightly
patch
on
the
crown
of
his
head
his
only
consolation
was
that
his
brow
was
now
very
noble
his
blue
eyes
had
lost
their
colour
they
had
a
listless
droop
and
his
mouth
losing
the
fulness
of
youth
was
weak
and
pale
he
still
talked
vaguely
of
the
things
he
was
going
to
do
in
the
future
but
with
less
conviction
and
he
was
conscious
that
his
friends
no
longer
believed
in
him
when
he
had
drank
two
or
three
glasses
of
whiskey
he
was
inclined
to
be
elegiac
im
a
failure
he
murmured
im
unfit
for
the
brutality
of
the
struggle
of
life
all
i
can
do
is
to
stand
aside
and
let
the
vulgar
throng
hustle
by
in
their
pursuit
of
the
good
things
he
gave
you
the
impression
that
to
fail
was
a
more
delicate
a
more
exquisite
thing
than
to
succeed
he
insinuated
that
his
aloofness
was
due
to
distaste
for
all
that
was
common
and
low
he
talked
beautifully
of
plato
i
should
have
thought
youd
got
through
with
plato
by
now
said
philip
impatiently
would
you
he
asked
raising
his
eyebrows
he
was
not
inclined
to
pursue
the
subject
he
had
discovered
of
late
the
effective
dignity
of
silence
i
dont
see
the
use
of
reading
the
same
thing
over
and
over
again
said
philip
thats
only
a
laborious
form
of
idleness
but
are
you
under
the
impression
that
you
have
so
great
a
mind
that
you
can
understand
the
most
profound
writer
at
a
first
reading
i
dont
want
to
understand
him
im
not
a
critic
im
not
interested
in
him
for
his
sake
but
for
mine
why
dyou
read
then
partly
for
pleasure
because
its
a
habit
and
im
just
as
uncomfortable
if
i
dont
read
as
if
i
dont
smoke
and
partly
to
know
myself
when
i
read
a
book
i
seem
to
read
it
with
my
eyes
only
but
now
and
then
i
come
across
a
passage
perhaps
only
a
phrase
which
has
a
meaning
for
me
and
it
becomes
part
of
me
ive
got
out
of
the
book
all
thats
any
use
to
me
and
i
cant
get
anything
more
if
i
read
it
a
dozen
times
you
see
it
seems
to
me
ones
like
a
closed
bud
and
most
of
what
one
reads
and
does
has
no
effect
at
all
but
there
are
certain
things
that
have
a
peculiar
significance
for
one
and
they
open
a
petal
and
the
petals
open
one
by
one
and
at
last
the
flower
is
there
philip
was
not
satisfied
with
his
metaphor
but
he
did
not
know
how
else
to
explain
a
thing
which
he
felt
and
yet
was
not
clear
about
you
want
to
do
things
you
want
to
become
things
said
hayward
with
a
shrug
of
the
shoulders
its
so
vulgar
philip
knew
hayward
very
well
by
now
he
was
weak
and
vain
so
vain
that
you
had
to
be
on
the
watch
constantly
not
to
hurt
his
feelings
he
mingled
idleness
and
idealism
so
that
he
could
not
separate
them
at
lawsons
studio
one
day
he
met
a
journalist
who
was
charmed
by
his
conversation
and
a
week
later
the
editor
of
a
paper
wrote
to
suggest
that
he
should
do
some
criticism
for
him
for
fortyeight
hours
hayward
lived
in
an
agony
of
indecision
he
had
talked
of
getting
occupation
of
this
sort
so
long
that
he
had
not
the
face
to
refuse
outright
but
the
thought
of
doing
anything
filled
him
with
panic
at
last
he
declined
the
offer
and
breathed
freely
it
would
have
interfered
with
my
work
he
told
philip
what
work
asked
philip
brutally
my
inner
life
he
answered
then
he
went
on
to
say
beautiful
things
about
amiel
the
professor
of
geneva
whose
brilliancy
promised
achievement
which
was
never
fulfilled
till
at
his
death
the
reason
of
his
failure
and
the
excuse
were
at
once
manifest
in
the
minute
wonderful
journal
which
was
found
among
his
papers
hayward
smiled
enigmatically
but
hayward
could
still
talk
delightfully
about
books
his
taste
was
exquisite
and
his
discrimination
elegant
and
he
had
a
constant
interest
in
ideas
which
made
him
an
entertaining
companion
they
meant
nothing
to
him
really
since
they
never
had
any
effect
on
him
but
he
treated
them
as
he
might
have
pieces
of
china
in
an
auctionroom
handling
them
with
pleasure
in
their
shape
and
their
glaze
pricing
them
in
his
mind
and
then
putting
them
back
into
their
case
thought
of
them
no
more
and
it
was
hayward
who
made
a
momentous
discovery
one
evening
after
due
preparation
he
took
philip
and
lawson
to
a
tavern
situated
in
beak
street
remarkable
not
only
in
itself
and
for
its
historyit
had
memories
of
eighteenthcentury
glories
which
excited
the
romantic
imaginationbut
for
its
snuff
which
was
the
best
in
london
and
above
all
for
its
punch
hayward
led
them
into
a
large
long
room
dingily
magnificent
with
huge
pictures
on
the
walls
of
nude
women
they
were
vast
allegories
of
the
school
of
haydon
but
smoke
gas
and
the
london
atmosphere
had
given
them
a
richness
which
made
them
look
like
old
masters
the
dark
panelling
the
massive
tarnished
gold
of
the
cornice
the
mahogany
tables
gave
the
room
an
air
of
sumptuous
comfort
and
the
leathercovered
seats
along
the
wall
were
soft
and
easy
there
was
a
rams
head
on
a
table
opposite
the
door
and
this
contained
the
celebrated
snuff
they
ordered
punch
they
drank
it
it
was
hot
rum
punch
the
pen
falters
when
it
attempts
to
treat
of
the
excellence
thereof
the
sober
vocabulary
the
sparse
epithet
of
this
narrative
are
inadequate
to
the
task
and
pompous
terms
jewelled
exotic
phrases
rise
to
the
excited
fancy
it
warmed
the
blood
and
cleared
the
head
it
filled
the
soul
with
wellbeing
it
disposed
the
mind
at
once
to
utter
wit
and
to
appreciate
the
wit
of
others
it
had
the
vagueness
of
music
and
the
precision
of
mathematics
only
one
of
its
qualities
was
comparable
to
anything
else
it
had
the
warmth
of
a
good
heart
but
its
taste
its
smell
its
feel
were
not
to
be
described
in
words
charles
lamb
with
his
infinite
tact
attempting
to
might
have
drawn
charming
pictures
of
the
life
of
his
day
lord
byron
in
a
stanza
of
don
juan
aiming
at
the
impossible
might
have
achieved
the
sublime
oscar
wilde
heaping
jewels
of
ispahan
upon
brocades
of
byzantium
might
have
created
a
troubling
beauty
considering
it
the
mind
reeled
under
visions
of
the
feasts
of
elagabalus
and
the
subtle
harmonies
of
debussy
mingled
with
the
musty
fragrant
romance
of
chests
in
which
have
been
kept
old
clothes
ruffs
hose
doublets
of
a
forgotten
generation
and
the
wan
odour
of
lilies
of
the
valley
and
the
savour
of
cheddar
cheese
hayward
discovered
the
tavern
at
which
this
priceless
beverage
was
to
be
obtained
by
meeting
in
the
street
a
man
called
macalister
who
had
been
at
cambridge
with
him
he
was
a
stockbroker
and
a
philosopher
he
was
accustomed
to
go
to
the
tavern
once
a
week
and
soon
philip
lawson
and
hayward
got
into
the
habit
of
meeting
there
every
tuesday
evening
change
of
manners
made
it
now
little
frequented
which
was
an
advantage
to
persons
who
took
pleasure
in
conversation
macalister
was
a
bigboned
fellow
much
too
short
for
his
width
with
a
large
fleshy
face
and
a
soft
voice
he
was
a
student
of
kant
and
judged
everything
from
the
standpoint
of
pure
reason
he
was
fond
of
expounding
his
doctrines
philip
listened
with
excited
interest
he
had
long
come
to
the
conclusion
that
nothing
amused
him
more
than
metaphysics
but
he
was
not
so
sure
of
their
efficacy
in
the
affairs
of
life
the
neat
little
system
which
he
had
formed
as
the
result
of
his
meditations
at
blackstable
had
not
been
of
conspicuous
use
during
his
infatuation
for
mildred
he
could
not
be
positive
that
reason
was
much
help
in
the
conduct
of
life
it
seemed
to
him
that
life
lived
itself
he
remembered
very
vividly
the
violence
of
the
emotion
which
had
possessed
him
and
his
inability
as
if
he
were
tied
down
to
the
ground
with
ropes
to
react
against
it
he
read
many
wise
things
in
books
but
he
could
only
judge
from
his
own
experience
he
did
not
know
whether
he
was
different
from
other
people
he
did
not
calculate
the
pros
and
cons
of
an
action
the
benefits
which
must
befall
him
if
he
did
it
the
harm
which
might
result
from
the
omission
but
his
whole
being
was
urged
on
irresistibly
he
did
not
act
with
a
part
of
himself
but
altogether
the
power
that
possessed
him
seemed
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
reason
all
that
reason
did
was
to
point
out
the
methods
of
obtaining
what
his
whole
soul
was
striving
for
macalister
reminded
him
of
the
categorical
imperative
act
so
that
every
action
of
yours
should
be
capable
of
becoming
a
universal
rule
of
action
for
all
men
that
seems
to
me
perfect
nonsense
said
philip
youre
a
bold
man
to
say
that
of
anything
stated
by
immanuel
kant
retorted
macalister
why
reverence
for
what
somebody
said
is
a
stultifying
quality
theres
a
damned
sight
too
much
reverence
in
the
world
kant
thought
things
not
because
they
were
true
but
because
he
was
kant
well
what
is
your
objection
to
the
categorical
imperative
they
talked
as
though
the
fate
of
empires
were
in
the
balance
it
suggests
that
one
can
choose
ones
course
by
an
effort
of
will
and
it
suggests
that
reason
is
the
surest
guide
why
should
its
dictates
be
any
better
than
those
of
passion
theyre
different
thats
all
you
seem
to
be
a
contented
slave
of
your
passions
a
slave
because
i
cant
help
myself
but
not
a
contented
one
laughed
philip
while
he
spoke
he
thought
of
that
hot
madness
which
had
driven
him
in
pursuit
of
mildred
he
remembered
how
he
had
chafed
against
it
and
how
he
had
felt
the
degradation
of
it
thank
god
im
free
from
all
that
now
he
thought
and
yet
even
as
he
said
it
he
was
not
quite
sure
whether
he
spoke
sincerely
when
he
was
under
the
influence
of
passion
he
had
felt
a
singular
vigour
and
his
mind
had
worked
with
unwonted
force
he
was
more
alive
there
was
an
excitement
in
sheer
being
an
eager
vehemence
of
soul
which
made
life
now
a
trifle
dull
for
all
the
misery
he
had
endured
there
was
a
compensation
in
that
sense
of
rushing
overwhelming
existence
but
philips
unlucky
words
engaged
him
in
a
discussion
on
the
freedom
of
the
will
and
macalister
with
his
wellstored
memory
brought
out
argument
after
argument
he
had
a
mind
that
delighted
in
dialectics
and
he
forced
philip
to
contradict
himself
he
pushed
him
into
corners
from
which
he
could
only
escape
by
damaging
concessions
he
tripped
him
up
with
logic
and
battered
him
with
authorities
at
last
philip
said
well
i
cant
say
anything
about
other
people
i
can
only
speak
for
myself
the
illusion
of
free
will
is
so
strong
in
my
mind
that
i
cant
get
away
from
it
but
i
believe
it
is
only
an
illusion
but
it
is
an
illusion
which
is
one
of
the
strongest
motives
of
my
actions
before
i
do
anything
i
feel
that
i
have
choice
and
that
influences
what
i
do
but
afterwards
when
the
thing
is
done
i
believe
that
it
was
inevitable
from
all
eternity
what
do
you
deduce
from
that
asked
hayward
why
merely
the
futility
of
regret
its
no
good
crying
over
spilt
milk
because
all
the
forces
of
the
universe
were
bent
on
spilling
it
chapter
lxviii
one
morning
philip
on
getting
up
felt
his
head
swim
and
going
back
to
bed
suddenly
discovered
he
was
ill
all
his
limbs
ached
and
he
shivered
with
cold
when
the
landlady
brought
in
his
breakfast
he
called
to
her
through
the
open
door
that
he
was
not
well
and
asked
for
a
cup
of
tea
and
a
piece
of
toast
a
few
minutes
later
there
was
a
knock
at
his
door
and
griffiths
came
in
they
had
lived
in
the
same
house
for
over
a
year
but
had
never
done
more
than
nod
to
one
another
in
the
passage
i
say
i
hear
youre
seedy
said
griffiths
i
thought
id
come
in
and
see
what
was
the
matter
with
you
philip
blushing
he
knew
not
why
made
light
of
the
whole
thing
he
would
be
all
right
in
an
hour
or
two
well
youd
better
let
me
take
your
temperature
said
griffiths
its
quite
unnecessary
answered
philip
irritably
come
on
philip
put
the
thermometer
in
his
mouth
griffiths
sat
on
the
side
of
the
bed
and
chatted
brightly
for
a
moment
then
he
took
it
out
and
looked
at
it
now
look
here
old
man
you
must
stay
in
bed
and
ill
bring
old
deacon
in
to
have
a
look
at
you
nonsense
said
philip
theres
nothing
the
matter
i
wish
you
wouldnt
bother
about
me
but
it
isnt
any
bother
youve
got
a
temperature
and
you
must
stay
in
bed
you
will
wont
you
there
was
a
peculiar
charm
in
his
manner
a
mingling
of
gravity
and
kindliness
which
was
infinitely
attractive
youve
got
a
wonderful
bedside
manner
philip
murmured
closing
his
eyes
with
a
smile
griffiths
shook
out
his
pillow
for
him
deftly
smoothed
down
the
bedclothes
and
tucked
him
up
he
went
into
philips
sittingroom
to
look
for
a
siphon
could
not
find
one
and
fetched
it
from
his
own
room
he
drew
down
the
blind
now
go
to
sleep
and
ill
bring
the
old
man
round
as
soon
as
hes
done
the
wards
it
seemed
hours
before
anyone
came
to
philip
his
head
felt
as
if
it
would
split
anguish
rent
his
limbs
and
he
was
afraid
he
was
going
to
cry
then
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
and
griffiths
healthy
strong
and
cheerful
came
in
heres
doctor
deacon
he
said
the
physician
stepped
forward
an
elderly
man
with
a
bland
manner
whom
philip
knew
only
by
sight
a
few
questions
a
brief
examination
and
the
diagnosis
what
dyou
make
it
he
asked
griffiths
smiling
influenza
quite
right
doctor
deacon
looked
round
the
dingy
lodginghouse
room
wouldnt
you
like
to
go
to
the
hospital
theyll
put
you
in
a
private
ward
and
you
can
be
better
looked
after
than
you
can
here
id
rather
stay
where
i
am
said
philip
he
did
not
want
to
be
disturbed
and
he
was
always
shy
of
new
surroundings
he
did
not
fancy
nurses
fussing
about
him
and
the
dreary
cleanliness
of
the
hospital
i
can
look
after
him

griffiths
at
once

said
philip
griffiths
put
his
hand
on
philips
forehead
a
large
cool
dry
hand
and
the
touch
seemed
to
him
good
im
just
going
to
take
this
round
to
the
dispensary
to
have
it
made
up
and
then
ill
come
back
in
a
little
while
he
brought
the
medicine
and
gave
philip
a
dose
then
he
went
upstairs
to
fetch
his
books
you
wont
mind

working
in
your
room

afternoon

you
he
said
when
he
came
down
ill

door
open
so
that
you
can
give
me
a
shout
if
you
want
anything
later
in
the
day
philip
awaking
from
an
uneasy
doze
heard
voices
in
his
sittingroom
a
friend
had
come
in
to
see
griffiths
i
say
youd
better
not
come
in
tonight
he
heard
griffiths
saying
and
then
a
minute
or
two
afterwards
someone
else
entered
the
room
and
expressed
his
surprise
at
finding
griffiths
there
philip
heard
him
explain
im
looking
after
a
second
years
man
whos
got
these
rooms
the
wretched
blighters
down
with
influenza
no
whist
tonight
old
man
presently
griffiths
was
left
alone
and
philip
called
him
i
say
youre
not
putting
off
a
party
tonight
are
you
he
asked
not
on
your
account

must
work
at
my
surgery
dont
put
it
off
i
shall
be
all
right
you
neednt
bother
about
me
thats
all
right
philip
grew
worse
as
the
night
came
on
he
became
slightly
delirious
but
towards
morning
he
awoke
from
a
restless
sleep
he
saw
griffiths
get
out
of
an
armchair
go
down
on
his
knees
and
with
his
fingers
put
piece
after
piece
of
coal
on
the
fire
he
was
in
pyjamas
and
a
dressinggown
what
are
you
doing
here
he
asked
did
i
wake
you
up
i
tried
to
make
up
the
fire
without
making
a
row
why
arent
you
in
bed
whats
the
time
about
five
i
thought
id
better
sit
up
with
you
tonight
i
brought
an
armchair
in
as
i
thought
if
i
put
a
mattress
down
i
should
sleep
so
soundly
that
i
shouldnt
hear
you
if
you
wanted
anything
i
wish
you
wouldnt
be
so
good
to
me
groaned
philip
suppose
you
catch
it
then
you
shall
nurse
me
old
man
said
griffiths
with
a
laugh
in
the
morning
griffiths
drew
up
the
blind
he
looked
pale
and
tired
after
his
nights
watch
but
was
full
of
spirits
now
im
going
to
wash
you
he
said
to
philip
cheerfully
i
can
wash
myself
said
philip
ashamed
nonsense
if
you
were
in
the
small
ward
a
nurse
would
wash
you
and
i
can
do
it
just
as
well
as
a
nurse
philip
too
weak
and
wretched
to
resist
allowed
griffiths
to
wash
his
hands
and
face
his
feet
his
chest
and
back
he
did
it
with
charming
tenderness
carrying
on
meanwhile
a
stream
of
friendly
chatter
then
he
changed
the
sheet
just
as
they
did
at
the
hospital
shook
out
the
pillow
and
arranged
the
bedclothes
i
should
like
sister
arthur
to
see
me
it
would
make
her
sit
up
deacons
coming
in
to
see
you
early
i
cant
imagine
why
you
should
be
so
good
to
me
said
philip
its
good
practice
for
me
its
rather
a
lark
having
a
patient
griffiths
gave
him
his
breakfast
and
went
off
to
get
dressed
and
have
something
to
eat
a
few
minutes
before
ten
he
came
back
with
a
bunch
of
grapes
and
a
few
flowers
you
are
awfully
kind
said
philip
he
was
in
bed
for
five
days
norah
and
griffiths
nursed
him
between
them
though
griffiths
was
the
same
age
as
philip
he
adopted
towards
him
a
humorous
motherly
attitude
he
was
a
thoughtful
fellow
gentle
and
encouraging
but
his
greatest
quality
was
a
vitality
which
seemed
to
give
health
to
everyone
with
whom
he
came
in
contact
philip
was
unused
to
the
petting
which
most
people
enjoy
from
mothers
or
sisters
and
he
was
deeply
touched
by
the
feminine
tenderness
of
this
strong
young
man
philip
grew
better
then
griffiths
sitting
idly
in
philips
room
amused
him
with
gay
stories
of
amorous
adventure
he
was
a
flirtatious
creature
capable
of
carrying
on
three
or
four
affairs
at
a
time
and
his
account
of
the
devices
he
was
forced
to
in
order
to
keep
out
of
difficulties
made
excellent
hearing
he
had
a
gift
for
throwing
a
romantic
glamour
over
everything
that
happened
to
him
he
was
crippled
with
debts
everything
he
had
of
any
value
was
pawned
but
he
managed
always
to
be
cheerful
extravagant
and
generous
he
was
the
adventurer
by
nature
he
loved
people
of
doubtful
occupations
and
shifty
purposes
and
his
acquaintance
among
the
riffraff
that
frequents
the
bars
of
london
was
enormous
loose
women
treating
him
as
a
friend
told
him
the
troubles
difficulties
and
successes
of
their
lives
and
cardsharpers
respecting
his
impecuniosity
stood
him
dinners
and
lent
him
fivepound
notes
he
was
ploughed
in
his
examinations
time
after
time
but
he
bore
this
cheerfully
and
submitted
with
such
a
charming
grace
to
the
parental
expostulations
that
his
father
a
doctor
in
practice
at
leeds
had
not
the
heart
to
be
seriously
angry
with
him
im
an
awful
fool
at
books
he
said
cheerfully
but
i
cant
work
life
was
much
too
jolly
but
it
was
clear
that
when
he
had
got
through
the
exuberance
of
his
youth
and
was
at
last
qualified
he
would
be
a
tremendous
success
in
practice
he
would
cure
people
by
the
sheer
charm
of
his
manner
philip
worshipped
him
as
at
school
he
had
worshipped
boys
who
were
tall
and
straight
and
high
of
spirits
by
the
time
he
was
well
they
were
fast
friends
and
it
was
a
peculiar
satisfaction
to
philip
that
griffiths
seemed
to
enjoy
sitting
in
his
little
parlour
wasting
philips
time
with
his
amusing
chatter
and
smoking
innumerable
cigarettes
philip
took
him
sometimes
to
the
tavern
off
regent
street
hayward
found
him
stupid
but
lawson
recognised
his
charm
and
was
eager
to
paint
him
he
was
a
picturesque
figure
with
his
blue
eyes
white
skin
and
curly
hair
often
they
discussed
things
he
knew
nothing
about
and
then
he
sat
quietly
with
a
goodnatured
smile
on
his
handsome
face
feeling
quite
rightly
that
his
presence
was
sufficient
contribution
to
the
entertainment
of
the
company
when
he
discovered
that
macalister
was
a
stockbroker
he
was
eager
for
tips
and
macalister
with
his
grave
smile
told
him
what
fortunes
he
could
have
made
if
he
had
bought
certain
stock
at
certain
times
it
made
philips
mouth
water
for
in
one
way
and
another
he
was
spending
more
than
he
had
expected
and
it
would
have
suited
him
very
well
to
make
a
little
money
by
the
easy
method
macalister
suggested
next
time
i
hear
of
a
really
good
thing
ill
let
you
know
said
the
stockbroker
they
do
come
along
sometimes
its
only
a
matter
of
biding
ones
time
philip
could
not
help
thinking
how
delightful
it
would
be
to
make
fifty
pounds
so
that
he
could
give
norah
the
furs
she
so
badly
needed
for
the
winter
he
looked
at
the
shops
in
regent
street
and
picked
out
the
articles
he
could
buy
for
the
money
she
deserved
everything
she
made
his
life
very
happy
chapter
lxix
one
afternoon
when
he
went
back
to
his
rooms
from
the
hospital
to
wash
and
tidy
himself
before
going
to
tea
as
usual
with
norah
as
he
let
himself
in
with
his
latchkey
his
landlady
opened
the
door
for
him
theres
a
lady
waiting
to
see
you
she
said
me
exclaimed
philip
he
was
surprised
it
would
only
be
norah
and
he
had
no
idea
what
had
brought
her
i
shouldnt
ave
let
her
in
only
shes
been
three
times
and
she
seemed
that
upset
at
not
finding
you
so
i
told
her
she
could
wait
he
pushed
past
the
explaining
landlady
and
burst
into
the
room
his
heart
turned
sick
it
was
mildred
she
was
sitting
down
but
got
up
hurriedly
as
he
came
in
she
did
not
move
towards
him
nor
speak
he
was
so
surprised
that
he
did
not
know
what
he
was
saying
what
the
hell
dyou
want
he
asked
she
did
not
answer
but
began
to
cry
she
did
not
put
her
hands
to
her
eyes
but
kept
them
hanging
by
the
side
of
her
body
she
looked
like
a
housemaid
applying
for
a
situation
there
was
a
dreadful
humility
in
her
bearing
philip
did
not
know
what
feelings
came
over
him
he
had
a
sudden
impulse
to
turn
round
and
escape
from
the
room
i
didnt
think
id
ever
see
you
again
he
said
at
last
i
wish
i
was
dead
she
moaned
philip
left
her
standing
where
she
was
he
could
only
think
at
the
moment
of
steadying
himself
his
knees
were
shaking
he
looked
at
her
and
he
groaned
in
despair
whats
the
matter
he
said
hes
left
meemil
philips
heart
bounded
he
knew
then
that
he
loved
her
as
passionately
as
ever
he
had
never
ceased
to
love
her
she
was
standing
before
him
humble
and
unresisting
he
wished
to
take
her
in
his
arms
and
cover
her
tearstained
face
with
kisses
oh
how
long
the
separation
had
been
he
did
not
know
how
he
could
have
endured
it
youd
better
sit
down
let
me
give
you
a
drink
he
drew
the
chair
near
the
fire
and
she
sat
in
it
he
mixed
her
whiskey
and
soda
and
sobbing
still
she
drank
it
she
looked
at
him
with
great
mournful
eyes
there
were
large
black
lines
under
them
she
was
thinner
and
whiter
than
when
last
he
had
seen
her
i
wish
id
married
you
when
you
asked
me
she
said
philip
did
not
know
why
the
remark
seemed
to
swell
his
heart
he
could
not
keep
the
distance
from
her
which
he
had
forced
upon
himself
he
put
his
hand
on
her
shoulder
im
awfully
sorry
youre
in
trouble
she
leaned
her
head
against
his
bosom
and
burst
into
hysterical
crying
her
hat
was
in
the
way
and
she
took
it
off
he
had
never
dreamt
that
she
was
capable
of
crying
like
that
he
kissed
her
again
and
again
it
seemed
to
ease
her
a
little
you
were
always
good
to
me
philip
she
said
thats
why
i
knew
i
could
come
to
you
tell
me
whats
happened
oh
i
cant
i
cant
she
cried
out
breaking
away
from
him
he
sank
down
on
his
knees
beside
her
and
put
his
cheek
against
hers
dont
you
know
that
theres
nothing
you
cant
tell
me
i
can
never
blame
you
for
anything
she
told
him
the
story
little
by
little
and
sometimes
she
sobbed
so
much
that
he
could
hardly
understand
last
monday
week
he
went
up
to
birmingham
and
he
promised
to
be
back
on
thursday
and
he
never
came
and
he
didnt
come
on
the
friday
so
i
wrote
to
ask
what
was
the
matter
and
he
never
answered
the
letter
and
i
wrote
and
said
that
if
i
didnt
hear
from
him
by
return
id
go
up
to
birmingham
and
this
morning
i
got
a
solicitors
letter
to
say
i
had
no
claim
on
him
and
if
i
molested
him
hed
seek
the
protection
of
the
law
but
its
absurd
cried
philip
a
man
cant
treat
his
wife
like
that
had
you
had
a
row
oh
yes
wed
had
a
quarrel
on
the
sunday
and
he
said
he
was
sick
of
me
but
hed
said
it
before
and
hed
come
back
all
right
i
didnt
think
he
meant
it
he
was
frightened
because
i
told
him
a
baby
was
coming
i
kept
it
from
him
as
long
as
i
could
then
i
had
to
tell
him
he
said
it
was
my
fault
and
i
ought
to
have
known
better
if
youd
only
heard
the
things
he
said
to
me
but
i
found
out
precious
quick
that
he
wasnt
a
gentleman
he
left
me
without
a
penny
he
hadnt
paid
the
rent
and
i
hadnt
got
the
money
to
pay
it
and
the
woman
who
kept
the
house
said
such
things
to
mewell
i
might
have
been
a
thief
the
way
she
talked
i
thought
you
were
going
to
take
a
flat
thats
what
he
said
but
we
just
took
furnished
apartments
in
highbury
he
was
that
mean
he
said
i
was
extravagant
he
didnt
give
me
anything
to
be
extravagant
with
she
had
an
extraordinary
way
of
mixing
the
trivial
with
the
important
philip
was
puzzled
the
whole
thing
was
incomprehensible
no
man
could
be
such
a
blackguard
you
dont
know
him
i
wouldnt
go
back
to
him
now
not
if
he
was
to
come
and
ask
me
on
his
bended
knees
i
was
a
fool
ever
to
think
of
him
and
he
wasnt
earning
the
money
he
said
he
was
the
lies
he
told
me
philip
thought
for
a
minute
or
two
he
was
so
deeply
moved
by
her
distress
that
he
could
not
think
of
himself
would
you
like
me
to
go
to
birmingham
i
could
see
him
and
try
to
make
things
up
oh
theres
no
chance
of
that
hell
never
come
back
now
i
know
him
but
he
must
provide
for
you
he
cant
get
out
of
that
i
dont
know
anything
about
these
things
youd
better
go
and
see
a
solicitor
how
can
i
i
havent
got
the
money
ill
pay
all
that
ill
write
a
note
to
my
own
solicitor
the
sportsman
who
was
my
fathers
executor
would
you
like
me
to
come
with
you
now
i
expect
hell
still
be
at
his
office
no
give
me
a
letter
to
him
ill
go
alone
she
was
a
little
calmer
now
he
sat
down
and
wrote
a
note
then
he
remembered
that
she
had
no
money
he
had
fortunately
changed
a
cheque
the
day
before
and
was
able
to
give
her
five
pounds
you
are
good
to
me
philip
she
said
im
so
happy
to
be
able
to
do
something
for
you
are
you
fond
of
me
still
just
as
fond
as
ever
she
put
up
her
lips
and
he
kissed
her
there
was
a
surrender
in
the
action
which
he
had
never
seen
in
her
before
it
was
worth
all
the
agony
he
had
suffered
she
went
away
and
he
found
that
she
had
been
there
for
two
hours
he
was
extraordinarily
happy
poor
thing
poor
thing
he
murmured
to
himself
his
heart
glowing
with
a
greater
love
than
he
had
ever
felt
before
he
never
thought
of
norah
at
all
till
about
eight
oclock
a
telegram
came
he
knew
before
opening
it
that
it
was
from
her
is
anything
the
matter
norah
he
did
not
know
what
to
do
nor
what
to
answer
he
could
fetch
her
after
the
play
in
which
she
was
walking
on
was
over
and
stroll
home
with
her
as
he
sometimes
did
but
his
whole
soul
revolted
against
the
idea
of
seeing
her
that
evening
he
thought
of
writing
to
her
but
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
address
her
as
usual
dearest
norah
he
made
up
his
mind
to
telegraph
sorry
could
not
get
away
philip
he
visualised
her
he
was
slightly
repelled
by
the
ugly
little
face
with
its
high
cheekbones
and
the
crude
colour
there
was
a
coarseness
in
her
skin
which
gave
him
gooseflesh
he
knew
that
his
telegram
must
be
followed
by
some
action
on
his
part
but
at
all
events
it
postponed
it
next
day
he
wired
again
regret
unable
to
come
will
write
mildred
had
suggested
coming
at
four
in
the
afternoon
and
he
would
not
tell
her
that
the
hour
was
inconvenient
after
all
she
came
first
he
waited
for
her
impatiently
he
watched
for
her
at
the
window
and
opened
the
frontdoor
himself
well

you
see
nixon

she
answered
he
said

good
nothings

grin
and
bear
it
but

philip

give
any
reasons

asked

crumpled
letter

a
sudden
pang
of
jealousy
and
anguish
it
was
almost
more
than
he
could
bear
thats
why
i
couldnt
go
back
to
my
aunt
theres
no
one
i
can
go
to
but

made
you
go
away
with
him
philip
asked
in
a
low
voice
which
he
struggled
to
make
firm
i
dont
know
i
didnt
know
he
was
a
married
man
at
first
and
when
he
told
me
i
gave
him
a
piece
of
my
mind
and
then
i
didnt
see
him
for
months
and
when
he
came
to
the
shop
again
and
asked
me
i
dont
know
what
came
over
me
i
felt
as
if
i
couldnt
help
it
i
had
to
go
with
him
were
you
in
love
with
him
i
dont
know
i
couldnt
hardly
help
laughing
at
the
things
he
said
and
there
was
something
about
himhe
said
id
never
regret
it
he
promised
to
give
me
seven
pounds
a
weekhe
said
he
was
earning
fifteen
and
it
was
all
a
lie
he
wasnt
and
then
i
was
sick
of
going
to
the
shop
every
morning
and
i
wasnt
getting
on
very
well
with
my
aunt
she
wanted
to
treat
me
as
a
servant
instead
of
a
relation
said
i
ought
to
do
my
own
room
and
if
i
didnt
do
it
nobody
was
going
to
do
it
for
me
oh
i
wish
i
hadnt
but
when
he
came
to
the
shop
and
asked
me
i
felt
i
couldnt
help
it
philip
moved
away
from
her
he
sat
down
at
the
table
and
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
he
felt
dreadfully
humiliated
youre
not
angry
with
me
philip
she
asked
piteously
no
he
answered
looking
up
but
away
from
her
only
im
awfully
hurt
why
you
see
i
was
so
dreadfully
in
love
with
you
i
did
everything
i
could
to
make
you
care
for
me
i
thought
you
were
incapable
of
loving
anyone
its
so
horrible
to
know
that
you
were
willing
to
sacrifice
everything
for
that
bounder
i
wonder
what
you
saw
in
him
im
awfully
sorry
philip
i
regretted
it
bitterly
afterwards
i
promise
you
that
he
thought
of
emil
miller
with
his
pasty
unhealthy
look
his
shifty
blue
eyes
and
the
vulgar
smartness
of
his
appearance
he
always
wore
bright
red
knitted
waistcoats
philip
sighed
she
got
up
and
went
to
him
she
put
her
arm
round
his
neck
i
shall
never
forget
that
you
offered
to
marry
me
philip
he
took
her
hand
and
looked
up
at
her
she
bent
down
and
kissed
him
philip
if
you
want
me
still
ill
do
anything
you
like
now
i
know
youre
a
gentleman
in
every
sense
of
the
word
his
heart
stood
still
her
words
made
him
feel
slightly
sick
its
awfully
good
of
you
but
i
couldnt
dont
you
care
for
me
any
more
yes
i
love
you
with
all
my
heart
then
why
shouldnt
we
have
a
good
time
while
weve
got
the
chance
you
see
it
cant
matter
now
he
released
himself
from
her
you
dont
understand
ive
been
sick
with
love
for
you
ever
since
i
saw
you
but
nowthat
man
ive
unfortunately
got
a
vivid
imagination
the
thought
of
it
simply
disgusts
me
you
are
funny
she
said
he
took
her
hand
again
and
smiled
at
her
you
mustnt
think
im
not
grateful
i
can
never
thank
you
enough
but
you
see
its
just
stronger
than
i
am
you
are
a
good
friend
philip
they
went
on
talking
and
soon
they
had
returned
to
the
familiar
companionship
of
old
days
it
grew
late
philip
suggested
that
they
should
dine
together
and
go
to
a
musichall
she
wanted
some
persuasion
for
she
had
an
idea
of
acting
up
to
her
situation
and
felt
instinctively
that
it
did
not
accord
with
her
distressed
condition
to
go
to
a
place
of
entertainment
at
last
philip
asked
her
to
go
simply
to
please
him
and
when
she
could
look
upon
it
as
an
act
of
selfsacrifice
she
accepted
she
had
a
new
thoughtfulness
which
delighted
philip
she
asked
him
to
take
her
to
the
little
restaurant
in
soho
to
which
they
had
so
often
been
he
was
infinitely
grateful
to
her
because
her
suggestion
showed
that
happy
memories
were
attached
to
it
she
grew
much
more
cheerful
as
dinner
proceeded
the
burgundy
from
the
public
house
at
the
corner
warmed
her
heart
and
she
forgot
that
she
ought
to
preserve
a
dolorous
countenance
philip
thought
it
safe
to
speak
to
her
of
the
future
i
suppose
you
havent
got
a
brass
farthing
have
you
he
asked
when
an
opportunity
presented
itself
only
what
you
gave
me
yesterday
and
i
had
to
give
the
landlady
three
pounds
of
that
well
id
better
give
you
a
tenner
to
go
on
with
ill
go
and
see
my
solicitor
and
get
him
to
write
to
miller
we
can
make
him
pay
up
something
im
sure
if
we
can
get
a
hundred
pounds
out
of
him
itll
carry
you
on
till
after
the
baby
comes
i
wouldnt
take
a
penny
from
him
id
rather
starve
but
its
monstrous
that
he
should
leave
you
in
the
lurch
like
this
ive
got
my
pride
to
consider
it
was
a
little
awkward
for
philip
he
needed
rigid
economy
to
make
his
own
money
last
till
he
was
qualified
and
he
must
have
something
over
to
keep
him
during
the
year
he
intended
to
spend
as
house
physician
and
house
surgeon
either
at
his
own
or
at
some
other
hospital
but
mildred
had
told
him
various
stories
of
emils
meanness
and
he
was
afraid
to
remonstrate
with
her
in
case
she
accused
him
too
of
want
of
generosity
i
wouldnt
take
a
penny
piece
from
him
id
sooner
beg
my
bread
id
have
seen
about
getting
some
work
to
do
long
before
now
only
it
wouldnt
be
good
for
me
in
the
state
im
in
you
have
to
think
of
your
health
dont
you
you
neednt
bother
about
the
present
said
philip
i
can
let
you
have
all
you
want
till
youre
fit
to
work
again
i
knew
i
could
depend
on
you
i
told
emil
he
neednt
think
i
hadnt
got
somebody
to
go
to
i
told
him
you
was
a
gentleman
in
every
sense
of
the
word
by
degrees
philip
learned
how
the
separation
had
come
about
it
appeared
that
the
fellows
wife
had
discovered
the
adventure
he
was
engaged
in
during
his
periodical
visits
to
london
and
had
gone
to
the
head
of
the
firm
that
employed
him
she
threatened
to
divorce
him
and
they
announced
that
they
would
dismiss
him
if
she
did
he
was
passionately
devoted
to
his
children
and
could
not
bear
the
thought
of
being
separated
from
them
when
he
had
to
choose
between
his
wife
and
his
mistress
he
chose
his
wife
he
had
been
always
anxious
that
there
should
be
no
child
to
make
the
entanglement
more
complicated
and
when
mildred
unable
longer
to
conceal
its
approach
informed
him
of
the
fact
he
was
seized
with
panic
he
picked
a
quarrel
and
left
her
without
more
ado
when
dyou
expect
to
be
confined
asked
philip
at
the
beginning
of
march
three
months
it
was
necessary
to
discuss
plans
mildred
declared
she
would
not
remain
in
the
rooms
at
highbury
and
philip
thought
it
more
convenient
too
that
she
should
be
nearer
to
him
he
promised
to
look
for
something
next
day
she
suggested
the
vauxhall
bridge
road
as
a
likely
neighbourhood
and
it
would
be
near
for
afterwards
she
said
what
do
you
mean
well
i
should
only
be
able
to
stay
there
about
two
months
or
a
little
more
and
then
i
should
have
to
go
into
a
house
i
know
a
very
respectable
place
where
they
have
a
most
superior
class
of
people
and
they
take
you
for
four
guineas
a
week
and
no
extras
of
course
the
doctors
extra
but
thats
all
a
friend
of
mine
went
there
and
the
lady
who
keeps
it
is
a
thorough
lady
i
mean
to
tell
her
that
my
husbands
an
officer
in
india
and
ive
come
to
london
for
my
baby
because
its
better
for
my
health
it
seemed
extraordinary
to
philip
to
hear
her
talking
in
this
way
with
her
delicate
little
features
and
her
pale
face
she
looked
cold
and
maidenly
when
he
thought
of
the
passions
that
burnt
within
her
so
unexpected
his
heart
was
strangely
troubled
his
pulse
beat
quickly
chapter
lxx
philip
expected
to
find
a
letter
from
norah
when
he
got
back
to
his
rooms
but
there
was
nothing
nor
did
he
receive
one
the
following
morning
the
silence
irritated
and
at
the
same
time
alarmed
him
they
had
seen
one
another
every
day
he
had
been
in
london
since
the
previous
june
and
it
must
seem
odd
to
her
that
he
should
let
two
days
go
by
without
visiting
her
or
offering
a
reason
for
his
absence
he
wondered
whether
by
an
unlucky
chance
she
had
seen
him
with
mildred
he
could
not
bear
to
think
that
she
was
hurt
or
unhappy
and
he
made
up
his
mind
to
call
on
her
that
afternoon
he
was
almost
inclined
to
reproach
her
because
he
had
allowed
himself
to
get
on
such
intimate
terms
with
her
the
thought
of
continuing
them
filled
him
with
disgust
he
found
two
rooms
for
mildred
on
the
second
floor
of
a
house
in
the
vauxhall
bridge
road
they
were
noisy
but
he
knew
that
she
liked
the
rattle
of
traffic
under
her
windows
i
dont
like
a
dead
and
alive
street
where
you
dont
see
a
soul
pass
all
day
she
said
give
me
a
bit
of
life
then
he
forced
himself
to
go
to
vincent
square
he
was
sick
with
apprehension
when
he
rang
the
bell
he
had
an
uneasy
sense
that
he
was
treating
norah
badly
he
dreaded
reproaches
he
knew
she
had
a
quick
temper
and
he
hated
scenes
perhaps
the
best
way
would
be
to
tell
her
frankly
that
mildred
had
come
back
to
him
and
his
love
for
her
was
as
violent
as
it
had
ever
been
he
was
very
sorry
but
he
had
nothing
to
offer
norah
any
more
then
he
thought
of
her
anguish
for
he
knew
she
loved
him
it
had
flattered
him
before
and
he
was
immensely
grateful
but
now
it
was
horrible
she
had
not
deserved
that
he
should
inflict
pain
upon
her
he
asked
himself
how
she
would
greet
him
now
and
as
he
walked
up
the
stairs
all
possible
forms
of
her
behaviour
flashed
across
his
mind
he
knocked
at
the
door
he
felt
that
he
was
pale
and
wondered
how
to
conceal
his
nervousness
she
was
writing
away
industriously
but
she
sprang
to
her
feet
as
he
entered
i
recognised
your
step
she
cried
where
have
you
been
hiding
yourself
you
naughty
boy
she
came
towards
him
joyfully
and
put
her
arms
round
his
neck
she
was
delighted
to
see
him
he
kissed
her
and
then
to
give
himself
countenance
said
he
was
dying
for
tea
she
bustled
the
fire
to
make
the
kettle
boil
ive
been
awfully
busy
he
said
lamely
she
began
to
chatter
in
her
bright
way
telling
him
of
a
new
commission
she
had
to
provide
a
novelette
for
a
firm
which
had
not
hitherto
employed
her
she
was
to
get
fifteen
guineas
for
it
its
money
from
the
clouds
ill
tell
you
what
well
do
well
stand
ourselves
a
little
jaunt
lets
go
and
spend
a
day
at
oxford
shall
we
id
love
to
see
the
colleges
he
looked
at
her
to
see
whether
there
was
any
shadow
of
reproach
in
her
eyes
but
they
were
as
frank
and
merry
as
ever
she
was
overjoyed
to
see
him
his
heart
sank
he
could
not
tell
her
the
brutal
truth
she
made
some
toast
for
him
and
cut
it
into
little
pieces
and
gave
it
him
as
though
he
were
a
child
is
the
brute
fed
she
asked
he
nodded
smiling
and
she
lit
a
cigarette
for
him
then
as
she
loved
to
do
she
came
and
sat
on
his
knees
she
was
very
light
she
leaned
back
in
his
arms
with
a
sigh
of
delicious
happiness
say
something
nice
to
me
she
murmured
what
shall
i
say
you
might
by
an
effort
of
imagination
say
that
you
rather
liked
me
you
know
i
do
that
he
had
not
the
heart
to
tell
her
then
he
would
give
her
peace
at
all
events
for
that
day
and
perhaps
he
might
write
to
her
that
would
be
easier
he
could
not
bear
to
think
of
her
crying
she
made
him
kiss
her
and
as
he
kissed
her
he
thought
of
mildred
and
mildreds
pale
thin
lips
the
recollection
of
mildred
remained
with
him
all
the
time
like
an
incorporated
form
but
more
substantial
than
a
shadow
and
the
sight
continually
distracted
his
attention
youre
very
quiet
today
norah
said
her
loquacity
was
a
standing
joke
between
them
and
he
answered
you
never
let
me
get
a
word
in
and
ive
got
out
of
the
habit
of
talking
but
youre
not
listening
and
thats
bad
manners
he
reddened
a
little
wondering
whether
she
had
some
inkling
of
his
secret
he
turned
away
his
eyes
uneasily
the
weight
of
her
irked
him
this
afternoon
and
he
did
not
want
her
to
touch
him
my
foots
gone
to
sleep
he
said
im
so
sorry
she
cried
jumping
up
i
shall
have
to
bant
if
i
cant
break
myself
of
this
habit
of
sitting
on
gentlemens
knees
he
went
through
an
elaborate
form
of
stamping
his
foot
and
walking
about
then
he
stood
in
front
of
the
fire
so
that
she
should
not
resume
her
position
while
she
talked
he
thought
that
she
was
worth
ten
of
mildred
she
amused
him
much
more
and
was
jollier
to
talk
to
she
was
cleverer
and
she
had
a
much
nicer
nature
she
was
a
good
brave
honest
little
woman
and
mildred
he
thought
bitterly
deserved
none
of
these
epithets
if
he
had
any
sense
he
would
stick
to
norah
she
would
make
him
much
happier
than
he
would
ever
be
with
mildred
after
all
she
loved
him
and
mildred
was
only
grateful
for
his
help
but
when
all
was
said
the
important
thing
was
to
love
rather
than
to
be
loved
and
he
yearned
for
mildred
with
his
whole
soul
he
would
sooner
have
ten
minutes
with
her
than
a
whole
afternoon
with
norah
he
prized
one
kiss
of
her
cold
lips
more
than
all
norah
could
give
him
i
cant
help
myself
he
thought
ive
just
got
her
in
my
bones
he
did
not
care
if
she
was
heartless
vicious
and
vulgar
stupid
and
grasping
he
loved
her
he
would
rather
have
misery
with
the
one
than
happiness
with
the
other
when
he
got
up
to
go
norah
said
casually
well
i
shall
see
you
tomorrow
shant
i
yes
he
answered
he
knew
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
come
since
he
was
going
to
help
mildred
with
her
moving
but
he
had
not
the
courage
to
say
so
he
made
up
his
mind
that
he
would
send
a
wire
mildred
saw
the
rooms
in
the
morning
was
satisfied
with
them
and
after
luncheon
philip
went
up
with
her
to
highbury
she
had
a
trunk
for
her
clothes
and
another
for
the
various
odds
and
ends
cushions
lampshades
photograph
frames
with
which
she
had
tried
to
give
the
apartments
a
homelike
air
she
had
two
or
three
large
cardboard
boxes
besides
but
in
all
there
was
no
more
than
could
be
put
on
the
roof
of
a
fourwheeler
as
they
drove
through
victoria
street
philip
sat
well
back
in
the
cab
in
case
norah
should
happen
to
be
passing
he
had
not
had
an
opportunity
to
telegraph
and
could
not
do
so
from
the
post
office
in
the
vauxhall
bridge
road
since
she
would
wonder
what
he
was
doing
in
that
neighbourhood
and
if
he
was
there
he
could
have
no
excuse
for
not
going
into
the
neighbouring
square
where
she
lived
he
made
up
his
mind
that
he
had
better
go
in
and
see
her
for
half
an
hour
but
the
necessity
irritated
him
he
was
angry
with
norah
because
she
forced
him
to
vulgar
and
degrading
shifts
but
he
was
happy
to
be
with
mildred
it
amused
him
to
help
her
with
the
unpacking
and
he
experienced
a
charming
sense
of
possession
in
installing
her
in
these
lodgings
which
he
had
found
and
was
paying
for
he
would
not
let
her
exert
herself
it
was
a
pleasure
to
do
things
for
her
and
she
had
no
desire
to
do
what
somebody
else
seemed
desirous
to
do
for
her
he
unpacked
her
clothes
and
put
them
away
she
was
not
proposing
to
go
out
again
so
he
got
her
slippers
and
took
off
her
boots
it
delighted
him
to
perform
menial
offices
you
do
spoil
me
she
said
running
her
fingers
affectionately
through
his
hair
while
he
was
on
his
knees
unbuttoning
her
boots
he
took
her
hands
and
kissed
them
it
is
nipping
to
have
you
here
he
arranged
the
cushions
and
the
photograph
frames
she
had
several
jars
of
green
earthenware
ill
get
you
some
flowers
for
them
he
said
he
looked
round
at
his
work
proudly
as
im
not
going
out
any
more
i
think
ill
get
into
a
teagown
she
said
undo
me
behind
will
you
she
turned
round
as
unconcernedly
as
though
he
were
a
woman
his
sex
meant
nothing
to
her
but
his
heart
was
filled
with
gratitude
for
the
intimacy
her
request
showed
he
undid
the
hooks
and
eyes
with
clumsy
fingers
that
first
day
i
came
into
the
shop
i
never
thought
id
be
doing
this
for
you
now
he
said
with
a
laugh
which
he
forced
somebody
must
do
it
she
answered
she
went
into
the
bedroom
and
slipped
into
a
pale
blue
teagown
decorated
with
a
great
deal
of
cheap
lace
then
philip
settled
her
on
a
sofa
and
made
tea
for
her
im
afraid
i
cant
stay
and
have
it
with
you
he
said
regretfully
ive
got
a
beastly
appointment
but
i
shall
be
back
in
half
an
hour
he
wondered
what
he
should
say
if
she
asked
him
what
the
appointment
was
but
she
showed
no
curiosity
he
had
ordered
dinner
for
the
two
of
them
when
he
took
the
rooms
and
proposed
to
spend
the
evening
with
her
quietly
he
was
in
such
a
hurry
to
get
back
that
he
took
a
tram
along
the
vauxhall
bridge
road
he
thought
he
had
better
break
the
fact
to
norah
at
once
that
he
could
not
stay
more
than
a
few
minutes
i
say
ive
got
only
just
time
to
say
how
dyou
do
he
said
as
soon
as
he
got
into
her
rooms
im
frightfully
busy
her
face
fell
why
whats
the
matter
it
exasperated
him
that
she
should
force
him
to
tell
lies
and
he
knew
that
he
reddened
when
he
answered
that
there
was
a
demonstration
at
the
hospital
which
he
was
bound
to
go
to
he
fancied
that
she
looked
as
though
she
did
not
believe
him
and
this
irritated
him
all
the
more
oh
well
it
doesnt
matter
she
said
i
shall
have
you
all
tomorrow
he
looked
at
her
blankly
it
was
sunday
and
he
had
been
looking
forward
to
spending
the
day
with
mildred
he
told
himself
that
he
must
do
that
in
common
decency
he
could
not
leave
her
by
herself
in
a
strange
house
im
awfully
sorry
im
engaged
tomorrow
he
knew
this
was
the
beginning
of
a
scene
which
he
would
have
given
anything
to
avoid
the
colour
on
norahs
cheeks
grew
brighter
but
ive
asked
the
gordons
to
lunchthey
were
an
actor
and
his
wife
who
were
touring
the
provinces
and
in
london
for
sundayi
told
you
about
it
a
week
ago
im
awfully
sorry
i
forgot
he
hesitated
im
afraid
i
cant
possibly
come
isnt
there
somebody
else
you
can
get
what
are
you
doing
tomorrow
then
i
wish
you
wouldnt
crossexamine
me
dont
you
want
to
tell
me
i
dont
in
the
least
mind
telling
you
but
its
rather
annoying
to
be
forced
to
account
for
all
ones
movements
norah
suddenly
changed
with
an
effort
of
selfcontrol
she
got
the
better
of
her
temper
and
going
up
to
him
took
his
hands
dont
disappoint
me
tomorrow
philip
ive
been
looking
forward
so
much
to
spending
the
day
with
you
the
gordons
want
to
see
you
and
well
have
such
a
jolly
time
id
love
to
if
i
could
im
not
very
exacting

i
i
dont
often
ask
you
to
do
anything
thats
a
bother
wont
you
get
out
of
your
horrid
engagementjust
this
once
im
awfully
sorry
i
dont
see
how
i
can
he
replied
sullenly
tell
me
what
it
is
she
said
coaxingly
he
had
had
time
to
invent
something
griffiths
two
sisters
are
up
for
the
weekend
and
were
taking
them
out
is
that
all
she
said
joyfully
griffiths
can
so
easily
get
another
man
he
wished
he
had
thought
of
something
more
urgent
than
that
it
was
a
clumsy
lie
no
im
awfully
sorry
i
cantive
promised
and
i
mean
to
keep
my
promise
but
you
promised
me
too
surely
i
come
first
i
wish
you
wouldnt
persist
he
said
she
flared
up
you
wont
come
because
you
dont
want
to
i
dont
know
what
youve
been
doing
the
last
few
days
youve
been
quite
different
he
looked
at
his
watch
im
afraid
ill
have
to
be
going
he
said
you
wont
come
tomorrow
no
in
that
case
you
neednt
trouble
to
come
again
she
cried
losing
her
temper
for
good
thats
just
as
you
like
he
answered
dont
let
me
detain
you
any
longer
she
added
ironically
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
walked
out
he
was
relieved
that
it
had
gone
no
worse
there
had
been
no
tears
as
he
walked
along
he
congratulated
himself
on
getting
out
of
the
affair
so
easily
he
went
into
victoria
street
and
bought
a
few
flowers
to
take
in
to
mildred
the
little
dinner
was
a
great
success
philip
had
sent
in
a
small
pot
of
caviare
which
he
knew
she
was
very
fond
of
and
the
landlady
brought
them
up
some
cutlets
with
vegetables
and
a
sweet
philip
had
ordered
burgundy
which
was
her
favourite
wine
with
the
curtains
drawn
a
bright
fire
and
one
of
mildreds
shades
on
the
lamp
the
room
was
cosy
its
really
just
like
home
smiled
philip
i
might
be
worse
off
mightnt
i
she
answered
when
they
finished
philip
drew
two
armchairs
in
front
of
the
fire
and
they
sat
down
he
smoked
his
pipe
comfortably
he
felt
happy
and
generous
what
would
you
like
to
do
tomorrow
he
asked
oh
im
going
to
tulse
hill
you
remember
the
manageress
at
the
shop
well
shes
married
now
and
shes
asked
me
to
go
and
spend
the
day
with
her
of
course
she
thinks
im
married
too
philips
heart
sank
but
i
refused
an
invitation
so
that
i
might
spend
sunday
with
you
he
thought
that
if
she
loved
him
she
would
say
that
in
that
case
she
would
stay
with
him
he
knew
very
well
that
norah
would
not
have
hesitated
well
you
were
a
silly
to
do
that
ive
promised
to
go
for
three
weeks
and
more
but
how
can
you
go
alone
oh
i
shall
say
that
emils
away
on
business
her
husbands
in
the
glove
trade
and
hes
a
very
superior
fellow
philip
was
silent
and
bitter
feelings
passed
through
his
heart
she
gave
him
a
sidelong
glance
you
dont
grudge
me
a
little
pleasure
philip
you
see
its
the
last
time
i
shall
be
able
to
go
anywhere
for
i
dont
know
how
long
and
i
had
promised
he
took
her
hand
and
smiled
no
darling
i
want
you
to
have
the
best
time
you
can
i
only
want
you
to
be
happy
there
was
a
little
book
bound
in
blue
paper
lying
open
face
downwards
on
the
sofa
and
philip
idly
took
it
up
it
was
a
twopenny
novelette
and
the
author
was
courtenay
paget
that
was
the
name
under
which
norah
wrote
i
do
like
his
books
said
mildred
i
read
them
all
theyre
so
refined
he
remembered
what
norah
had
said
of
herself
i
have
an
immense
popularity
among
kitchenmaids
they
think
me
so
genteel
chapter
lxxi
philip
in
return
for
griffiths
confidences
had
told
him
the
details
of
his
own
complicated
amours
and
on
sunday
morning
after
breakfast
when
they
sat
by
the
fire
in
their
dressinggowns
and
smoked
he
recounted
the
scene
of
the
previous
day
griffiths
congratulated
him
because
he
had
got
out
of
his
difficulties
so
easily
its
the
simplest
thing
in
the
world
to
have
an
affair
with
a
woman
he
remarked
sententiously
but
its
a
devil
of
a
nuisance
to
get
out
of
it
philip
felt
a
little
inclined
to
pat
himself
on
the
back
for
his
skill
in
managing
the
business
at
all
events
he
was
immensely
relieved
he
thought
of
mildred
enjoying
herself
in
tulse
hill
and
he
found
in
himself
a
real
satisfaction
because
she
was
happy
it
was
an
act
of
selfsacrifice
on
his
part
that
he
did
not
grudge
her
pleasure
even
though
paid
for
by
his
own
disappointment
and
it
filled
his
heart
with
a
comfortable
glow
but
on
monday
morning
he
found
on
his
table
a
letter
from
norah
she
wrote
dearest
im
sorry
i
was
cross
on
saturday
forgive
me
and
come
to
tea
in
the
afternoon
as
usual
i
love
you
your
norah
his
heart
sank
and
he
did
not
know
what
to
do
he
took
the
note
to
griffiths
and
showed
it
to
him
youd
better
leave
it
unanswered
said
he
oh
i
cant
cried
philip
i
should
be
miserable
if
i
thought
of
her
waiting
and
waiting
you
dont
know
what
it
is
to
be
sick
for
the
postmans
knock
i
do
and
i
cant
expose
anybody
else
to
that
torture
my
dear
fellow
one
cant
break
that
sort
of
affair
off
without
somebody
suffering
you
must
just
set
your
teeth
to
that
one
thing
is
it
doesnt
last
very
long
philip
felt
that
norah
had
not
deserved
that
he
should
make
her
suffer
and
what
did
griffiths
know
about
the
degrees
of
anguish
she
was
capable
of
he
remembered
his
own
pain
when
mildred
had
told
him
she
was
going
to
be
married
he
did
not
want
anyone
to
experience
what
he
had
experienced
then
if
youre
so
anxious
not
to
give
her
pain
go
back
to
her
said
griffiths
i
cant
do
that
he
got
up
and
walked
up
and
down
the
room
nervously
he
was
angry
with
norah
because
she
had
not
let
the
matter
rest
she
must
have
seen
that
he
had
no
more
love
to
give
her
they
said
women
were
so
quick
at
seeing
those
things
you
might
help
me
he
said
to
griffiths
my
dear
fellow
dont
make
such
a
fuss
about
it
people
do
get
over
these
things
you
know
she
probably
isnt
so
wrapped
up
in
you
as
you
think
either
ones
always
rather
apt
to
exaggerate
the
passion
ones
inspired
other
people
with
he
paused
and
looked
at
philip
with
amusement
look
here
theres
only
one
thing
you
can
do
write
to
her
and
tell
her
the
things
over
put
it
so
that
there
can
be
no
mistake
about
it
itll
hurt
her
but
itll
hurt
her
less
if
you
do
the
thing
brutally
than
if
you
try
halfhearted
ways
philip
sat
down
and
wrote
the
following
letter
my
dear
norah
i
am
sorry
to
make
you
unhappy
but
i
think
we
had
better
let
things
remain
where
we
left
them
on
saturday
i
dont
think
theres
any
use
in
letting
these
things
drag
on
when
theyve
ceased
to
be
amusing
you
told
me
to
go
and
i
went
i
do
not
propose
to
come
back
goodbye
philip
carey
he
showed
the
letter
to
griffiths
and
asked
him
what
he
thought
of
it
griffiths
read
it
and
looked
at
philip
with
twinkling
eyes
he
did
not
say
what
he
felt
i
think
thatll
do
the
trick
he
said
philip
went
out
and
posted
it
he
passed
an
uncomfortable
morning
for
he
imagined
with
great
detail
what
norah
would
feel
when
she
received
his
letter
he
tortured
himself
with
the
thought
of
her
tears
but
at
the
same
time
he
was
relieved
imagined
grief
was
more
easy
to
bear
than
grief
seen
and
he
was
free
now
to
love
mildred
with
all
his
soul
his
heart
leaped
at
the
thought
of
going
to
see
her
that
afternoon
when
his
days
work
at
the
hospital
was
over
when
as
usual
he
went
back
to
his
rooms
to
tidy
himself
he
had
no
sooner
put
the
latchkey
in
his
door
than
he
heard
a
voice
behind
him
may
i
come
in
ive
been
waiting
for
you
for
half
an
hour
it
was
norah
he
felt
himself
blush
to
the
roots
of
his
hair
she
spoke
gaily
there
was
no
trace
of
resentment
in
her
voice
and
nothing
to
indicate
that
there
was
a
rupture
between
them
he
felt
himself
cornered
he
was
sick
with
fear
but
he
did
his
best
to
smile
yes
do
he
said
he
opened
the
door
and
she
preceded
him
into
his
sittingroom
he
was
nervous
and
to
give
himself
countenance
offered
her
a
cigarette
and
lit
one
for
himself
she
looked
at
him
brightly
why
did
you
write
me
such
a
horrid
letter
you
naughty
boy
if
id
taken
it
seriously
it
would
have
made
me
perfectly
wretched
it
was
meant
seriously
he
answered
gravely
dont
be
so
silly
i
lost
my
temper
the
other
day
and
i
wrote
and
apologised
you
werent
satisfied
so
ive
come
here
to
apologise
again
after
all
youre
your
own
master
and
i
have
no
claims
upon
you
i
dont
want
you
to
do
anything
you
dont
want
to
she
got
up
from
the
chair
in
which
she
was
sitting
and
went
towards
him
impulsively
with
outstretched
hands
lets
make
friends
again
philip
im
so
sorry
if
i
offended
you
he
could
not
prevent
her
from
taking
his
hands
but
he
could
not
look
at
her
im
afraid
its
too
late
he
said
she
let
herself
down
on
the
floor
by
his
side
and
clasped
his
knees
philip
dont
be
silly
im
quicktempered
too
and
i
can
understand
that
i
hurt
you
but
its
so
stupid
to
sulk
over
it
whats
the
good
of
making
us
both
unhappy
its
been
so
jolly
our
friendship
she
passed
her
fingers
slowly
over
his
hand
i
love
you
philip
he
got
up
disengaging
himself
from
her
and
went
to
the
other
side
of
the
room
im
awfully
sorry
i
cant
do
anything
the
whole
things
over
dyou
mean
to
say
you
dont
love
me
any
more
im
afraid
so
you
were
just
looking
for
an
opportunity
to
throw
me
over
and
you
took
that
one
he
did
not
answer
she
looked
at
him
steadily
for
a
time
which
seemed
intolerable
she
was
sitting
on
the
floor
where
he
had
left
her
leaning
against
the
armchair
she
began
to
cry
quite
silently
without
trying
to
hide
her
face
and
the
large
tears
rolled
down
her
cheeks
one
after
the
other
she
did
not
sob
it
was
horribly
painful
to
see
her
philip
turned
away
im
awfully
sorry
to
hurt
you
its
not
my
fault
if
i
dont
love
you
she
did
not
answer
she
merely
sat
there
as
though
she
were
overwhelmed
and
the
tears
flowed
down
her
cheeks
it
would
have
been
easier
to
bear
if
she
had
reproached
him
he
had
thought
her
temper
would
get
the
better
of
her
and
he
was
prepared
for
that
at
the
back
of
his
mind
was
a
feeling
that
a
real
quarrel
in
which
each
said
to
the
other
cruel
things
would
in
some
way
be
a
justification
of
his
behaviour
the
time
passed
at
last
he
grew
frightened
by
her
silent
crying
he
went
into
his
bedroom
and
got
a
glass
of
water
he
leaned
over
her
wont
you
drink
a
little
itll
relieve
you
she
put
her
lips
listlessly
to
the
glass
and
drank
two
or
three
mouthfuls
then
in
an
exhausted
whisper
she
asked
him
for
a
handkerchief
she
dried
her
eyes
of
course
i
knew
you
never
loved
me
as
much
as
i
loved
you
she
moaned
im
afraid
thats
always
the
case
he
said
theres
always
one
who
loves
and
one
who
lets
himself
be
loved
he
thought
of
mildred
and
a
bitter
pain
traversed
his
heart
norah
did
not
answer
for
a
long
time
id
been
so
miserably
unhappy
and
my
life
was
so
hateful
she
said
at
last
she
did
not
speak
to
him
but
to
herself
he
had
never
heard
her
before
complain
of
the
life
she
had
led
with
her
husband
or
of
her
poverty
he
had
always
admired
the
bold
front
she
displayed
to
the
world
and
then
you
came
along
and
you
were
so
good
to
me
and
i
admired
you
because
you
were
clever
and
it
was
so
heavenly
to
have
someone
i
could
put
my
trust
in
i
loved
you
i
never
thought
it
could
come
to
an
end
and
without
any
fault
of
mine
at
all
her
tears
began
to
flow
again
but
now
she
was
more
mistress
of
herself
and
she
hid
her
face
in
philips
handkerchief
she
tried
hard
to
control
herself
give
me
some
more
water
she
said
she
wiped
her
eyes
im
sorry
to
make
such
a
fool
of
myself
i
was
so
unprepared
im
awfully
sorry
norah
i
want
you
to
know
that
im
very
grateful
for
all
youve
done
for
me
he
wondered
what
it
was
she
saw
in
him
oh
its
always
the
same
she
sighed
if
you
want
men
to
behave
well
to
you
you
must
be
beastly
to
them
if
you
treat
them
decently
they
make
you
suffer
for
it
she
got
up
from
the
floor
and
said
she
must
go
she
gave
philip
a
long
steady
look
then
she
sighed
its
so
inexplicable
what
does
it
all
mean
philip
took
a
sudden
determination
i
think
id
better
tell
you
i
dont
want
you
to
think
too
badly
of
me
i
want
you
to
see
that
i
cant
help
myself
mildreds
come
back
the
colour
came
to
her
face
why
didnt
you
tell
me
at
once
i
deserved
that
surely
i
was
afraid
to
she
looked
at
herself
in
the
glass
and
set
her
hat
straight
will
you
call
me
a
cab
she
said
i
dont
feel
i
can
walk
he
went
to
the
door
and
stopped
a
passing
hansom
but
when
she
followed
him
into
the
street
he
was
startled
to
see
how
white
she
was
there
was
a
heaviness
in
her
movements
as
though
she
had
suddenly
grown
older
she
looked
so
ill
that
he
had
not
the
heart
to
let
her
go
alone
ill
drive
back
with
you
if
you
dont
mind
she
did
not
answer
and
he
got
into
the
cab
they
drove
along
in
silence
over
the
bridge
through
shabby
streets
in
which
children
with
shrill
cries
played
in
the
road
when
they
arrived
at
her
door
she
did
not
immediately
get
out
it
seemed
as
though
she
could
not
summon
enough
strength
to
her
legs
to
move
i
hope
youll
forgive
me
norah
he
said
she
turned
her
eyes
towards
him
and
he
saw
that
they
were
bright
again
with
tears
but
she
forced
a
smile
to
her
lips
poor
fellow
youre
quite
worried
about
me
you
mustnt
bother
i
dont
blame
you
i
shall
get
over
it
all
right
lightly
and
quickly
she
stroked
his
face
to
show
him
that
she
bore
no
illfeeling
the
gesture
was
scarcely
more
than
suggested
then
she
jumped
out
of
the
cab
and
let
herself
into
her
house
philip
paid
the
hansom
and
walked
to
mildreds
lodgings
there
was
a
curious
heaviness
in
his
heart
he
was
inclined
to
reproach
himself
but
why
he
did
not
know
what
else
he
could
have
done
passing
a
fruiterers
he
remembered
that
mildred
was
fond
of
grapes
he
was
so
grateful
that
he
could
show
his
love
for
her
by
recollecting
every
whim
she
had
chapter
lxxii
for
the
next
three
months
philip
went
every
day
to
see
mildred
he
took
his
books
with
him
and
after
tea
worked
while
mildred
lay
on
the
sofa
reading
novels
sometimes
he
would
look
up
and
watch
her
for
a
minute
a
happy
smile
crossed
his
lips
she
would
feel
his
eyes
upon
her
dont
waste
your
time
looking
at
me
silly
go
on
with
your
work
she
said
tyrant
he
answered
gaily
he
put
aside
his
book
when
the
landlady
came
in
to
lay
the
cloth
for
dinner
and
in
his
high
spirits
he
exchanged
chaff
with
her
she
was
a
little
cockney
of
middle
age
with
an
amusing
humour
and
a
quick
tongue
mildred
had
become
great
friends
with
her
and
had
given
her
an
elaborate
but
mendacious
account
of
the
circumstances
which
had
brought
her
to
the
pass
she
was
in
the
goodhearted
little
woman
was
touched
and
found
no
trouble
too
great
to
make
mildred
comfortable
mildreds
sense
of
propriety
had
suggested
that
philip
should
pass
himself
off
as
her
brother
they
dined
together
and
philip
was
delighted
when
he
had
ordered
something
which
tempted
mildreds
capricious
appetite
it
enchanted
him
to
see
her
sitting
opposite
him
and
every
now
and
then
from
sheer
joy
he
took
her
hand
and
pressed
it
after
dinner
she
sat
in
the
armchair
by
the
fire
and
he
settled
himself
down
on
the
floor
beside
her
leaning
against
her
knees
and
smoked
often
they
did
not
talk
at
all
and
sometimes
philip
noticed
that
she
had
fallen
into
a
doze
he
dared
not
move
then
in
case
he
woke
her
and
he
sat
very
quietly
looking
lazily
into
the
fire
and
enjoying
his
happiness
had
a
nice
little
nap
he
smiled
when
she
woke
ive
not
been
sleeping
she
answered
i
only
just
closed
my
eyes
she
would
never
acknowledge
that
she
had
been
asleep
she
had
a
phlegmatic
temperament
and
her
condition
did
not
seriously
inconvenience
her
she
took
a
lot
of
trouble
about
her
health
and
accepted
the
advice
of
anyone
who
chose
to
offer
it
she
went
for
a
constitutional
every
morning
that
it
was
fine
and
remained
out
a
definite
time
when
it
was
not
too
cold
she
sat
in
st
james
park
but
the
rest
of
the
day
she
spent
quite
happily
on
her
sofa
reading
one
novel
after
another
or
chatting
with
the
landlady
she
had
an
inexhaustible
interest
in
gossip
and
told
philip
with
abundant
detail
the
history
of
the
landlady
of
the
lodgers
on
the
drawingroom
floor
and
of
the
people
who
lived
in
the
next
house
on
either
side
now
and
then
she
was
seized
with
panic
she
poured
out
her
fears
to
philip
about
the
pain
of
the
confinement
and
was
in
terror
lest
she
should
die
she
gave
him
a
full
account
of
the
confinements
of
the
landlady
and
of
the
lady
on
the
drawingroom
floor
mildred
did
not
know
her
im
one
to
keep
myself
to
myself
she
said
im
not
one
to
go
about
with
anybody
and
she
narrated
details
with
a
queer
mixture
of
horror
and
gusto
but
for
the
most
part
she
looked
forward
to
the
occurrence
with
equanimity
after
all
im
not
the
first
one
to
have
a
baby
am
i
and
the
doctor
says
i
shant
have
any
trouble
you
see
it
isnt
as
if
i
wasnt
well
made
mrs
owen
the
owner
of
the
house
she
was
going
to
when
her
time
came
had
recommended
a
doctor
and
mildred
saw
him
once
a
week
he
was
to
charge
fifteen
guineas
of
course
i
could
have
got
it
done
cheaper
but
mrs
owen
strongly
recommended
him
and
i
thought
it
wasnt
worth
while
to
spoil
the
ship
for
a
coat
of
tar
if
you
feel
happy
and
comfortable
i
dont
mind
a
bit
about
the
expense
said
philip
she
accepted
all
that
philip
did
for
her
as
if
it
were
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
and
on
his
side
he
loved
to
spend
money
on
her
each
fivepound
note
he
gave
her
caused
him
a
little
thrill
of
happiness
and
pride
he
gave
her
a
good
many
for
she
was
not
economical
i
dont
know
where
the
money
goes
to
she
said
herself
it
seems
to
slip
through
my
fingers
like
water
it
doesnt
matter
said
philip
im
so
glad
to
be
able
to
do
anything
i
can
for
you
she
could
not
sew
well
and
so
did
not
make
the
necessary
things
for
the
baby
she
told
philip
it
was
much
cheaper
in
the
end
to
buy
them
philip
had
lately
sold
one
of
the
mortgages
in
which
his
money
had
been
put
and
now
with
five
hundred
pounds
in
the
bank
waiting
to
be
invested
in
something
that
could
be
more
easily
realised
he
felt
himself
uncommonly
welltodo
they
talked
often
of
the
future
philip
was
anxious
that
mildred
should
keep
the
child
with
her
but
she
refused
she
had
her
living
to
earn
and
it
would
be
more
easy
to
do
this
if
she
had
not
also
to
look
after
a
baby
her
plan
was
to
get
back
into
one
of
the
shops
of
the
company
for
which
she
had
worked
before
and
the
child
could
be
put
with
some
decent
woman
in
the
country
i
can
find
someone
wholl
look
after
it
well
for
seven
and
sixpence
a
week
itll
be
better
for
the
baby
and
better
for
me
it
seemed
callous
to
philip
but
when
he
tried
to
reason
with
her
she
pretended
to
think
he
was
concerned
with
the
expense
you
neednt
worry
about
that
she
said
i
shant
ask
you
to
pay
for
it
you
know
i
dont
care
how
much
i
pay
at
the
bottom
of
her
heart
was
the
hope
that
the
child
would
be
stillborn
she
did
no
more
than
hint
it
but
philip
saw
that
the
thought
was
there
he
was
shocked
at
first
and
then
reasoning
with
himself
he
was
obliged
to
confess
that
for
all
concerned
such
an
event
was
to
be
desired
its
all
very
fine
to
say
this
and
that
mildred
remarked
querulously
but
its
jolly
difficult
for
a
girl
to
earn
her
living
by
herself
it
doesnt
make
it
any
easier
when
shes
got
a
baby
fortunately
youve
got
me
to
fall
back
on
smiled
philip
taking
her
hand
youve
been
good
to
me
philip
oh
what
rot
you
cant
say
i
didnt
offer
anything
in
return
for
what
youve
done
good
heavens
i
dont
want
a
return
if
ive
done
anything
for
you
ive
done
it
because
i
love
you
you
owe
me
nothing
i
dont
want
you
to
do
anything
unless
you
love
me
he
was
a
little
horrified
by
her
feeling
that
her
body
was
a
commodity
which
she
could
deliver
indifferently
as
an
acknowledgment
for
services
rendered
but
i
do
want
to
philip
youve
been
so
good
to
me
well
it
wont
hurt
for
waiting
when
youre
all
right
again
well
go
for
our
little
honeymoon
you
are
naughty
she
said
smiling
mildred
expected
to
be
confined
early
in
march
and
as
soon
as
she
was
well
enough
she
was
to
go
to
the
seaside
for
a
fortnight
that
would
give
philip
a
chance
to
work
without
interruption
for
his
examination
after
that
came
the
easter
holidays
and
they
had
arranged
to
go
to
paris
together
philip
talked
endlessly
of
the
things
they
would
do
paris
was
delightful
then
they
would
take
a
room
in
a
little
hotel
he
knew
in
the
latin
quarter
and
they
would
eat
in
all
sorts
of
charming
little
restaurants
they
would
go
to
the
play
and
he
would
take
her
to
music
halls
it
would
amuse
her
to
meet
his
friends
he
had
talked
to
her
about
cronshaw
she
would
see
him
and
there
was
lawson
he
had
gone
to
paris
for
a
couple
of
months
and
they
would
go
to
the
bai
bullier
there
were
excursions
they
would
make
trips
to
versailles
chartres
fontainebleau
itll
cost
a
lot
of
money
she
said
oh
damn
the
expense
think
how
ive
been
looking
forward
to
it
dont
you
know
what
it
means
to
me
ive
never
loved
anyone
but
you
i
never
shall
she
listened
to
his
enthusiasm
with
smiling
eyes
he
thought
he
saw
in
them
a
new
tenderness
and
he
was
grateful
to
her
she
was
much
gentler
than
she
used
to
be
there
was
in
her
no
longer
the
superciliousness
which
had
irritated
him
she
was
so
accustomed
to
him
now
that
she
took
no
pains
to
keep
up
before
him
any
pretences
she
no
longer
troubled
to
do
her
hair
with
the
old
elaboration
but
just
tied
it
in
a
knot
and
she
left
off
the
vast
fringe
which
she
generally
wore
the
more
careless
style
suited
her
her
face
was
so
thin
that
it
made
her
eyes
seem
very
large
there
were
heavy
lines
under
them
and
the
pallor
of
her
cheeks
made
their
colour
more
profound
she
had
a
wistful
look
which
was
infinitely
pathetic
there
seemed
to
philip
to
be
in
her
something
of
the
madonna
he
wished
they
could
continue
in
that
same
way
always
he
was
happier
than
he
had
ever
been
in
his
life
he
used
to
leave
her
at
ten
oclock
every
night
for
she
liked
to
go
to
bed
early
and
he
was
obliged
to
put
in
another
couple
of
hours
work
to
make
up
for
the
lost
evening
he
generally
brushed
her
hair
for
her
before
he
went
he
had
made
a
ritual
of
the
kisses
he
gave
her
when
he
bade
her
goodnight
first
he
kissed
the
palms
of
her
hands
how
thin
the
fingers
were
the
nails
were
beautiful
for
she
spent
much
time
in
manicuring
them
then
he
kissed
her
closed
eyes
first
the
right
one
and
then
the
left
and
at
last
he
kissed
her
lips
he
went
home
with
a
heart
overflowing
with
love
he
longed
for
an
opportunity
to
gratify
the
desire
for
selfsacrifice
which
consumed
him
presently
the
time
came
for
her
to
move
to
the
nursinghome
where
she
was
to
be
confined
philip
was
then
able
to
visit
her
only
in
the
afternoons
mildred
changed
her
story
and
represented
herself
as
the
wife
of
a
soldier
who
had
gone
to
india
to
join
his
regiment
and
philip
was
introduced
to
the
mistress
of
the
establishment
as
her
brotherinlaw
i
have
to
be
rather
careful
what
i
say
she
told
him
as
theres
another
lady
here
whose
husbands
in
the
indian
civil
i
wouldnt
let
that
disturb
me
if
i
were
you
said
philip
im
convinced
that
her
husband
and
yours
went
out
on
the
same
boat
what
boat
she
asked
innocently
the
flying
dutchman
mildred
was
safely
delivered
of
a
daughter
and
when
philip
was
allowed
to
see
her
the
child
was
lying
by
her
side
mildred
was
very
weak
but
relieved
that
everything
was
over
she
showed
him
the
baby
and
herself
looked
at
it
curiously
its
a
funnylooking
little
thing
isnt
it
i
cant
believe
its
mine
it
was
red
and
wrinkled
and
odd
philip
smiled
when
he
looked
at
it
he
did
not
quite
know
what
to
say
and
it
embarrassed
him
because
the
nurse
who
owned
the
house
was
standing
by
his
side
and
he
felt
by
the
way
she
was
looking
at
him
that
disbelieving
mildreds
complicated
story
she
thought
he
was
the
father
what
are
you
going
to
call
her
asked
philip
i
cant
make
up
my
mind
if
i
shall
call
her
madeleine
or
cecilia
the
nurse
left
them
alone
for
a
few
minutes
and
philip
bent
down
and
kissed
mildred
on
the
mouth
im
so
glad
its
all
over
happily
darling
she
put
her
thin
arms
round
his
neck
you
have
been
a
brick
to
me
phil
dear
now
i
feel
that
youre
mine
at
last
ive
waited
so
long
for
you
my
dear
they
heard
the
nurse
at
the
door
and
philip
hurriedly
got
up
the
nurse
entered
there
was
a
slight
smile
on
her
lips
chapter
lxxiii
three
weeks
later
philip
saw
mildred
and
her
baby
off
to
brighton
she
had
made
a
quick
recovery
and
looked
better
than
he
had
ever
seen
her
she
was
going
to
a
boardinghouse
where
she
had
spent
a
couple
of
weekends
with
emil
miller
and
had
written
to
say
that
her
husband
was
obliged
to
go
to
germany
on
business
and
she
was
coming
down
with
her
baby
she
got
pleasure
out
of
the
stories
she
invented
and
she
showed
a
certain
fertility
of
invention
in
the
working
out
of
the
details
mildred
proposed
to
find
in
brighton
some
woman
who
would
be
willing
to
take
charge
of
the
baby
philip
was
startled
at
the
callousness
with
which
she
insisted
on
getting
rid
of
it
so
soon
but
she
argued
with
common
sense
that
the
poor
child
had
much
better
be
put
somewhere
before
it
grew
used
to
her
philip
had
expected
the
maternal
instinct
to
make
itself
felt
when
she
had
had
the
baby
two
or
three
weeks
and
had
counted
on
this
to
help
him
persuade
her
to
keep
it
but
nothing
of
the
sort
occurred
mildred
was
not
unkind
to
her
baby
she
did
all
that
was
necessary
it
amused
her
sometimes
and
she
talked
about
it
a
good
deal
but
at
heart
she
was
indifferent
to
it
she
could
not
look
upon
it
as
part
of
herself
she
fancied
it
resembled
its
father
already
she
was
continually
wondering
how
she
would
manage
when
it
grew
older
and
she
was
exasperated
with
herself
for
being
such
a
fool
as
to
have
it
at
all
if
id
only
known
then
all
i
do
now
she
said
she
laughed
at
philip
because
he
was
anxious
about
its
welfare
you
couldnt
make
more
fuss
if
you
was
the
father
she
said
id
like
to
see
emil
getting
into
such
a
stew
about
it
philips
mind
was
full
of
the
stories
he
had
heard
of
babyfarming
and
the
ghouls
who
illtreat
the
wretched
children
that
selfish
cruel
parents
have
put
in
their
charge
dont
be
so
silly
said
mildred
thats
when
you
give
a
woman
a
sum
down
to
look
after
a
baby
but
when
youre
going
to
pay
so
much
a
week
its
to
their
interest
to
look
after
it
well
philip
insisted
that
mildred
should
place
the
child
with
people
who
had
no
children
of
their
own
and
would
promise
to
take
no
other
dont
haggle
about
the
price
he
said
id
rather
pay
half
a
guinea
a
week
than
run
any
risk
of
the
kid
being
starved
or
beaten
youre
a
funny
old
thing
philip
she
laughed
to
him
there
was
something
very
touching
in
the
childs
helplessness
it
was
small
ugly
and
querulous
its
birth
had
been
looked
forward
to
with
shame
and
anguish
nobody
wanted
it
it
was
dependent
on
him
a
stranger
for
food
shelter
and
clothes
to
cover
its
nakedness
as
the
train
started
he
kissed
mildred
he
would
have
kissed
the
baby
too
but
he
was
afraid
she
would
laugh
at
him
you
will
write
to
me
darling
wont
you
and
i
shall
look
forward
to
your
coming
back
with
oh
such
impatience
mind
you
get
through
your
exam
he
had
been
working
for
it
industriously
and
now
with
only
ten
days
before
him
he
made
a
final
effort
he
was
very
anxious
to
pass
first
to
save
himself
time
and
expense
for
money
had
been
slipping
through
his
fingers
during
the
last
four
months
with
incredible
speed
and
then
because
this
examination
marked
the
end
of
the
drudgery
after
that
the
student
had
to
do
with
medicine
midwifery
and
surgery
the
interest
of
which
was
more
vivid
than
the
anatomy
and
physiology
with
which
he
had
been
hitherto
concerned
philip
looked
forward
with
interest
to
the
rest
of
the
curriculum
nor
did
he
want
to
have
to
confess
to
mildred
that
he
had
failed
though
the
examination
was
difficult
and
the
majority
of
candidates
were
ploughed
at
the
first
attempt
he
knew
that
she
would
think
less
well
of
him
if
he
did
not
succeed
she
had
a
peculiarly
humiliating
way
of
showing
what
she
thought
mildred
sent
him
a
postcard
to
announce
her
safe
arrival
and
he
snatched
half
an
hour
every
day
to
write
a
long
letter
to
her
he
had
always
a
certain
shyness
in
expressing
himself
by
word
of
mouth
but
he
found
he
could
tell
her
pen
in
hand
all
sorts
of
things
which
it
would
have
made
him
feel
ridiculous
to
say
profiting
by
the
discovery
he
poured
out
to
her
his
whole
heart
he
had
never
been
able
to
tell
her
before
how
his
adoration
filled
every
part
of
him
so
that
all
his
actions
all
his
thoughts
were
touched
with
it
he
wrote
to
her
of
the
future
the
happiness
that
lay
before
him
and
the
gratitude
which
he
owed
her
he
asked
himself
he
had
often
asked
himself
before
but
had
never
put
it
into
words
what
it
was
in
her
that
filled
him
with
such
extravagant
delight
he
did
not
know
he
knew
only
that
when
she
was
with
him
he
was
happy
and
when
she
was
away
from
him
the
world
was
on
a
sudden
cold
and
gray
he
knew
only
that
when
he
thought
of
her
his
heart
seemed
to
grow
big
in
his
body
so
that
it
was
difficult
to
breathe
as
if
it
pressed
against
his
lungs
and
it
throbbed
so
that
the
delight
of
her
presence
was
almost
pain
his
knees
shook
and
he
felt
strangely
weak
as
though
not
having
eaten
he
were
tremulous
from
want
of
food
he
looked
forward
eagerly
to
her
answers
he
did
not
expect
her
to
write
often
for
he
knew
that
letterwriting
came
difficultly
to
her
and
he
was
quite
content
with
the
clumsy
little
note
that
arrived
in
reply
to
four
of
his
she
spoke
of
the
boardinghouse
in
which
she
had
taken
a
room
of
the
weather
and
the
baby
told
him
she
had
been
for
a
walk
on
the
front
with
a
ladyfriend
whom
she
had
met
in
the
boardinghouse
and
who
had
taken
such
a
fancy
to
baby
she
was
going
to
the
theatre
on
saturday
night
and
brighton
was
filling
up
it
touched
philip
because
it
was
so
matteroffact
the
crabbed
style
the
formality
of
the
matter
gave
him
a
queer
desire
to
laugh
and
to
take
her
in
his
arms
and
kiss
her
he
went
into
the
examination
with
happy
confidence
there
was
nothing
in
either
of
the
papers
that
gave
him
trouble
he
knew
that
he
had
done
well
and
though
the
second
part
of
the
examination
was
viva
voce
and
he
was
more
nervous
he
managed
to
answer
the
questions
adequately
he
sent
a
triumphant
telegram
to
mildred
when
the
result
was
announced
when
he
got
back
to
his
rooms
philip
found
a
letter
from
her
saying
that
she
thought
it
would
be
better
for
her
to
stay
another
week
in
brighton
she
had
found
a
woman
who
would
be
glad
to
take
the
baby
for
seven
shillings
a
week
but
she
wanted
to
make
inquiries
about
her
and
she
was
herself
benefiting
so
much
by
the
seaair
that
she
was
sure
a
few
days
more
would
do
her
no
end
of
good
she
hated
asking
philip
for
money
but
would
he
send
some
by
return
as
she
had
had
to
buy
herself
a
new
hat
she
couldnt
go
about
with
her
ladyfriend
always
in
the
same
hat
and
her
ladyfriend
was
so
dressy
philip
had
a
moment
of
bitter
disappointment
it
took
away
all
his
pleasure
at
getting
through
his
examination
if
she
loved
me
one
quarter
as
much
as
i
love
her
she
couldnt
bear
to
stay
away
a
day
longer
than
necessary
he
put
the
thought
away
from
him
quickly
it
was
pure
selfishness
of
course
her
health
was
more
important
than
anything
else
but
he
had
nothing
to
do
now
he
might
spend
the
week
with
her
in
brighton
and
they
could
be
together
all
day
his
heart
leaped
at
the
thought
it
would
be
amusing
to
appear
before
mildred
suddenly
with
the
information
that
he
had
taken
a
room
in
the
boardinghouse
he
looked
out
trains
but
he
paused
he
was
not
certain
that
she
would
be
pleased
to
see
him
she
had
made
friends
in
brighton
he
was
quiet
and
she
liked
boisterous
joviality
he
realised
that
she
amused
herself
more
with
other
people
than
with
him
it
would
torture
him
if
he
felt
for
an
instant
that
he
was
in
the
way
he
was
afraid
to
risk
it
he
dared
not
even
write
and
suggest
that
with
nothing
to
keep
him
in
town
he
would
like
to
spend
the
week
where
he
could
see
her
every
day
she
knew
he
had
nothing
to
do
if
she
wanted
him
to
come
she
would
have
asked
him
to
he
dared
not
risk
the
anguish
he
would
suffer
if
he
proposed
to
come
and
she
made
excuses
to
prevent
him
he
wrote
to
her
next
day
sent
her
a
fivepound
note
and
at
the
end
of
his
letter
said
that
if
she
were
very
nice
and
cared
to
see
him
for
the
weekend
he
would
be
glad
to
run
down
but
she
was
by
no
means
to
alter
any
plans
she
had
made
he
awaited
her
answer
with
impatience
in
it
she
said
that
if
she
had
only
known
before
she
could
have
arranged
it
but
she
had
promised
to
go
to
a
musichall
on
the
saturday
night
besides
it
would
make
the
people
at
the
boardinghouse
talk
if
he
stayed
there
why
did
he
not
come
on
sunday
morning
and
spend
the
day
they
could
lunch
at
the
metropole
and
she
would
take
him
afterwards
to
see
the
very
superior
ladylike
person
who
was
going
to
take
the
baby
sunday
he
blessed
the
day
because
it
was
fine
as
the
train
approached
brighton
the
sun
poured
through
the
carriage
window
mildred
was
waiting
for
him
on
the
platform
how
jolly
of
you
to
come
and
meet
me
he
cried
as
he
seized
her
hands
you
expected
me
didnt
you
i
hoped
you
would
i
say
how
well
youre
looking
its
done
me
a
rare
lot
of
good
but
i
think
im
wise
to
stay
here
as
long
as
i
can
and
there
are
a
very
nice
class
of
people
at
the
boardinghouse
i
wanted
cheering
up
after
seeing
nobody
all
these
months
it
was
dull
sometimes
she
looked
very
smart
in
her
new
hat
a
large
black
straw
with
a
great
many
inexpensive
flowers
on
it
and
round
her
neck
floated
a
long
boa
of
imitation
swansdown
she
was
still
very
thin
and
she
stooped
a
little
when
she
walked
she
had
always
done
that
but
her
eyes
did
not
seem
so
large
and
though
she
never
had
any
colour
her
skin
had
lost
the
earthy
look
it
had
they
walked
down
to
the
sea
philip
remembering
he
had
not
walked
with
her
for
months
grew
suddenly
conscious
of
his
limp
and
walked
stiffly
in
the
attempt
to
conceal
it
are
you
glad
to
see
me
he
asked
love
dancing
madly
in
his
heart
of
course
i
am
you
neednt
ask
that
by
the
way
griffiths
sends
you
his
love
what
cheek
he
had
talked
to
her
a
great
deal
of
griffiths
he
had
told
her
how
flirtatious
he
was
and
had
amused
her
often
with
the
narration
of
some
adventure
which
griffiths
under
the
seal
of
secrecy
had
imparted
to
him
mildred
had
listened
with
some
pretence
of
disgust
sometimes
but
generally
with
curiosity
and
philip
admiringly
had
enlarged
upon
his
friends
good
looks
and
charm
im
sure
youll
like
him
just
as
much
as
i
do
hes
so
jolly
and
amusing
and
hes
such
an
awfully
good
sort
philip
told
her
how
when
they
were
perfect
strangers
griffiths
had
nursed
him
through
an
illness
and
in
the
telling
griffiths
selfsacrifice
lost
nothing
you
cant
help
liking
him
said
philip
i
dont
like
goodlooking
men
said
mildred
theyre
too
conceited
for
me
he
wants
to
know
you
ive
talked
to
him
about
you
an
awful
lot
what
have
you
said
asked
mildred
philip
had
no
one
but
griffiths
to
talk
to
of
his
love
for
mildred
and
little
by
little
had
told
him
the
whole
story
of
his
connection
with
her
he
described
her
to
him
fifty
times
he
dwelt
amorously
on
every
detail
of
her
appearance
and
griffiths
knew
exactly
how
her
thin
hands
were
shaped
and
how
white
her
face
was
and
he
laughed
at
philip
when
he
talked
of
the
charm
of
her
pale
thin
lips
by
jove
im
glad
i
dont
take
things
so
badly
as
that
he
said
life
wouldnt
be
worth
living
philip
smiled
griffiths
did
not
know
the
delight
of
being
so
madly
in
love
that
it
was
like
meat
and
wine
and
the
air
one
breathed
and
whatever
else
was
essential
to
existence
griffiths
knew
that
philip
had
looked
after
the
girl
while
she
was
having
her
baby
and
was
now
going
away
with
her
well
i
must
say
youve
deserved
to
get
something
he
remarked
it
must
have
cost
you
a
pretty
penny
its
lucky
you
can
afford
it
i
cant
said
philip
but
what
do
i
care
since
it
was
early
for
luncheon
philip
and
mildred
sat
in
one
of
the
shelters
on
the
parade
sunning
themselves
and
watched
the
people
pass
there
were
the
brighton
shopboys
who
walked
in
twos
and
threes
swinging
their
canes
and
there
were
the
brighton
shopgirls
who
tripped
along
in
giggling
bunches
they
could
tell
the
people
who
had
come
down
from
london
for
the
day
the
keen
air
gave
a
fillip
to
their
weariness
there
were
many
jews
stout
ladies
in
tight
satin
dresses
and
diamonds
little
corpulent
men
with
a
gesticulative
manner
there
were
middleaged
gentlemen
spending
a
weekend
in
one
of
the
large
hotels
carefully
dressed
and
they
walked
industriously
after
too
substantial
a
breakfast
to
give
themselves
an
appetite
for
too
substantial
a
luncheon
they
exchanged
the
time
of
day
with
friends
and
talked
of
dr
brighton
or
londonbythesea
here
and
there
a
wellknown
actor
passed
elaborately
unconscious
of
the
attention
he
excited
sometimes
he
wore
patent
leather
boots
a
coat
with
an
astrakhan
collar
and
carried
a
silverknobbed
stick
and
sometimes
looking
as
though
he
had
come
from
a
days
shooting
he
strolled
in
knickerbockers
and
ulster
of
harris
tweed
and
a
tweed
hat
on
the
back
of
his
head
the
sun
shone
on
the
blue
sea
and
the
blue
sea
was
trim
and
neat
after
luncheon
they
went
to
hove
to
see
the
woman
who
was
to
take
charge
of
the
baby
she
lived
in
a
small
house
in
a
back
street
but
it
was
clean
and
tidy
her
name
was
mrs
harding
she
was
an
elderly
stout
person
with
gray
hair
and
a
red
fleshy
face
she
looked
motherly
in
her
cap
and
philip
thought
she
seemed
kind
wont
you
find
it
an
awful
nuisance
to
look
after
a
baby
he
asked
her
she
explained
that
her
husband
was
a
curate
a
good
deal
older
than
herself
who
had
difficulty
in
getting
permanent
work
since
vicars
wanted
young
men
to
assist
them
he
earned
a
little
now
and
then
by
doing
locums
when
someone
took
a
holiday
or
fell
ill
and
a
charitable
institution
gave
them
a
small
pension
but
her
life
was
lonely
it
would
be
something
to
do
to
look
after
a
child
and
the
few
shillings
a
week
paid
for
it
would
help
her
to
keep
things
going
she
promised
that
it
should
be
well
fed
quite
the
lady
isnt
she
said
mildred
when
they
went
away
they
went
back
to
have
tea
at
the
metropole
mildred
liked
the
crowd
and
the
band
philip
was
tired
of
talking
and
he
watched
her
face
as
she
looked
with
keen
eyes
at
the
dresses
of
the
women
who
came
in
she
had
a
peculiar
sharpness
for
reckoning
up
what
things
cost
and
now
and
then
she
leaned
over
to
him
and
whispered
the
result
of
her
meditations
dyou
see
that
aigrette
there
that
cost
every
bit
of
seven
guineas
or
look
at
that
ermine
philip
thats
rabbit
that
isthats
not
ermine
she
laughed
triumphantly
id
know
it
a
mile
off
philip
smiled
happily
he
was
glad
to
see
her
pleasure
and
the
ingenuousness
of
her
conversation
amused
and
touched
him
the
band
played
sentimental
music
after
dinner
they
walked
down
to
the
station
and
philip
took
her
arm
he
told
her
what
arrangements
he
had
made
for
their
journey
to
france
she
was
to
come
up
to
london
at
the
end
of
the
week
but
she
told
him
that
she
could
not
go
away
till
the
saturday
of
the
week
after
that
he
had
already
engaged
a
room
in
a
hotel
in
paris
he
was
looking
forward
eagerly
to
taking
the
tickets
you
wont
mind
going
secondclass
will
you
we
mustnt
be
extravagant
and
itll
be
all
the
better
if
we
can
do
ourselves
pretty
well
when
we
get
there
he
had
talked
to
her
a
hundred
times
of
the
quarter
they
would
wander
through
its
pleasant
old
streets
and
they
would
sit
idly
in
the
charming
gardens
of
the
luxembourg
if
the
weather
was
fine
perhaps
when
they
had
had
enough
of
paris
they
might
go
to
fontainebleau
the
trees
would
be
just
bursting
into
leaf
the
green
of
the
forest
in
spring
was
more
beautiful
than
anything
he
knew
it
was
like
a
song
and
it
was
like
the
happy
pain
of
love
mildred
listened
quietly
he
turned
to
her
and
tried
to
look
deep
into
her
eyes
you
do
want
to
come
dont
you
he
said
of
course
i
do
she
smiled
you
dont
know
how
im
looking
forward
to
it
i
dont
know
how
i
shall
get
through
the
next
days
im
so
afraid
something
will
happen
to
prevent
it
it
maddens
me
sometimes
that
i
cant
tell
you
how
much
i
love
you
and
at
last
at
last
he
broke
off
they
reached
the
station
but
they
had
dawdled
on
the
way
and
philip
had
barely
time
to
say
goodnight
he
kissed
her
quickly
and
ran
towards
the
wicket
as
fast
as
he
could
she
stood
where
he
left
her
he
was
strangely
grotesque
when
he
ran
chapter
lxxiv
the
following
saturday
mildred
returned
and
that
evening
philip
kept
her
to
himself
he
took
seats
for
the
play
and
they
drank
champagne
at
dinner
it
was
her
first
gaiety
in
london
for
so
long
that
she
enjoyed
everything
ingenuously
she
cuddled
up
to
philip
when
they
drove
from
the
theatre
to
the
room
he
had
taken
for
her
in
pimlico
i
really
believe
youre
quite
glad
to
see
me
he
said
she
did
not
answer
but
gently
pressed
his
hand
demonstrations
of
affection
were
so
rare
with
her
that
philip
was
enchanted
ive
asked
griffiths
to
dine
with
us
tomorrow
he
told
her
oh
im
glad
youve
done
that
i
wanted
to
meet
him
there
was
no
place
of
entertainment
to
take
her
to
on
sunday
night
and
philip
was
afraid
she
would
be
bored
if
she
were
alone
with
him
all
day
griffiths
was
amusing
he
would
help
them
to
get
through
the
evening
and
philip
was
so
fond
of
them
both
that
he
wanted
them
to
know
and
to
like
one
another
he
left
mildred
with
the
words
only
six
days
more
they
had
arranged
to
dine
in
the
gallery
at
romanos
on
sunday
because
the
dinner
was
excellent
and
looked
as
though
it
cost
a
good
deal
more
than
it
did
philip
and
mildred
arrived
first
and
had
to
wait
some
time
for
griffiths
hes
an
unpunctual
devil
said
philip
hes
probably
making
love
to
one
of
his
numerous
flames
but
presently
he
appeared
he
was
a
handsome
creature
tall
and
thin
his
head
was
placed
well
on
the
body
it
gave
him
a
conquering
air
which
was
attractive
and
his
curly
hair
his
bold
friendly
blue
eyes
his
red
mouth
were
charming
philip
saw
mildred
look
at
him
with
appreciation
and
he
felt
a
curious
satisfaction
griffiths
greeted
them
with
a
smile
ive
heard
a
great
deal
about
you
he
said
to
mildred
as
he
took
her
hand
not
so
much
as
ive
heard
about
you
she
answered
nor
so
bad
said
philip
has
he
been
blackening
my
character
griffiths
laughed
and
philip
saw
that
mildred
noticed
how
white
and
regular
his
teeth
were
and
how
pleasant
his
smile
you
ought
to
feel
like
old
friends
said
philip
ive
talked
so
much
about
you
to
one
another
griffiths
was
in
the
best
possible
humour
for
having
at
length
passed
his
final
examination
he
was
qualified
and
he
had
just
been
appointed
housesurgeon
at
a
hospital
in
the
north
of
london
he
was
taking
up
his
duties
at
the
beginning
of
may
and
meanwhile
was
going
home
for
a
holiday
this
was
his
last
week
in
town
and
he
was
determined
to
get
as
much
enjoyment
into
it
as
he
could
he
began
to
talk
the
gay
nonsense
which
philip
admired
because
he
could
not
copy
it
there
was
nothing
much
in
what
he
said
but
his
vivacity
gave
it
point
there
flowed
from
him
a
force
of
life
which
affected
everyone
who
knew
him
it
was
almost
as
sensible
as
bodily
warmth
mildred
was
more
lively
than
philip
had
ever
known
her
and
he
was
delighted
to
see
that
his
little
party
was
a
success
she
was
amusing
herself
enormously
she
laughed
louder
and
louder
she
quite
forgot
the
genteel
reserve
which
had
become
second
nature
to
her
presently
griffiths
said
i
say
its
dreadfully
difficult
for
me
to
call
you
mrs
miller
philip
never
calls
you
anything
but
mildred
i
daresay
she
wont
scratch
your
eyes
out
if
you
call
her
that
too
laughed
philip
then
she
must
call
me
harry
philip
sat
silent
while
they
chattered
away
and
thought
how
good
it
was
to
see
people
happy
now
and
then
griffiths
teased
him
a
little
kindly
because
he
was
always
so
serious
i
believe
hes
quite
fond
of
you
philip
smiled
mildred
he
isnt
a
bad
old
thing
answered
griffiths
and
taking
philips
hand
he
shook
it
gaily
it
seemed
an
added
charm
in
griffiths
that
he
liked
philip
they
were
all
sober
people
and
the
wine
they
had
drunk
went
to
their
heads
griffiths
became
more
talkative
and
so
boisterous
that
philip
amused
had
to
beg
him
to
be
quiet
he
had
a
gift
for
storytelling
and
his
adventures
lost
nothing
of
their
romance
and
their
laughter
in
his
narration
he
played
in
all
of
them
a
gallant
humorous
part
mildred
her
eyes
shining
with
excitement
urged
him
on
he
poured
out
anecdote
after
anecdote
when
the
lights
began
to
be
turned
out
she
was
astonished
my
word
the
evening
has
gone
quickly
i
thought
it
wasnt
more
than
half
past
nine
they
got
up
to
go
and
when
she
said
goodbye
she
added
im
coming
to
have
tea
at
philips
room
tomorrow
you
might
look
in
if
you
can
all
right
he
smiled
on
the
way
back
to
pimlico
mildred
talked
of
nothing
but
griffiths
she
was
taken
with
his
good
looks
his
wellcut
clothes
his
voice
his
gaiety
i
am
glad
you
like
him
said
philip
dyou
remember
you
were
rather
sniffy
about
meeting
him
i
think
its
so
nice
of
him
to
be
so
fond
of
you
philip
he
is
a
nice
friend
for
you
to
have
she
put
up
her
face
to
philip
for
him
to
kiss
her
it
was
a
thing
she
did
rarely
i
have
enjoyed
myself
this
evening
philip
thank
you
so
much
dont
be
so
absurd
he
laughed
touched
by
her
appreciation
so
that
he
felt
the
moisture
come
to
his
eyes
she
opened
her
door
and
just
before
she
went
in
turned
again
to
philip
tell
harry
im
madly
in
love
with
him
she
said
all
right
he
laughed
goodnight
next
day
when
they
were
having
tea
griffiths
came
in
he
sank
lazily
into
an
armchair
there
was
something
strangely
sensual
in
the
slow
movements
of
his
large
limbs
philip
remained
silent
while
the
others
chattered
away
but
he
was
enjoying
himself
he
admired
them
both
so
much
that
it
seemed
natural
enough
for
them
to
admire
one
another
he
did
not
care
if
griffiths
absorbed
mildreds
attention
he
would
have
her
to
himself
during
the
evening
he
had
something
of
the
attitude
of
a
loving
husband
confident
in
his
wifes
affection
who
looks
on
with
amusement
while
she
flirts
harmlessly
with
a
stranger
but
at
half
past
seven
he
looked
at
his
watch
and
said
its
about
time
we
went
out
to
dinner
mildred
there
was
a
moments
pause
and
griffiths
seemed
to
be
considering
well
ill
be
getting
along
he
said
at
last
i
didnt
know
it
was
so
late
are
you
doing
anything
tonight
asked
mildred
no
there
was
another
silence
philip
felt
slightly
irritated
ill
just
go
and
have
a
wash
he
said
and
to
mildred
he
added
would
you
like
to
wash
your
hands
she
did
not
answer
him
why
dont
you
come
and
dine
with
us
she
said
to
griffiths
he
looked
at
philip
and
saw
him
staring
at
him
sombrely
i
dined
with
you
last
night
he
laughed
i
should
be
in
the
way
oh
that
doesnt
matter
insisted
mildred
make
him
come
philip
he
wont
be
in
the
way
will
he
let
him
come
by
all
means
if
hed
like
to
all
right
then
said
griffiths
promptly
ill
just
go
upstairs
and
tidy
myself
the
moment
he
left
the
room
philip
turned
to
mildred
angrily
why
on
earth
did
you
ask
him
to
dine
with
us
i
couldnt
help
myself
it
would
have
looked
so
funny
to
say
nothing
when
he
said
he
wasnt
doing
anything
oh
what
rot
and
why
the
hell
did
you
ask
him
if
he
was
doing
anything
mildreds
pale
lips
tightened
a
little
i
want
a
little
amusement
sometimes
i
get
tired
always
being
alone
with
you
they
heard
griffiths
coming
heavily
down
the
stairs
and
philip
went
into
his
bedroom
to
wash
they
dined
in
the
neighbourhood
in
an
italian
restaurant
philip
was
cross
and
silent
but
he
quickly
realised
that
he
was
showing
to
disadvantage
in
comparison
with
griffiths
and
he
forced
himself
to
hide
his
annoyance
he
drank
a
good
deal
of
wine
to
destroy
the
pain
that
was
gnawing
at
his
heart
and
he
set
himself
to
talk
mildred
as
though
remorseful
for
what
she
had
said
did
all
she
could
to
make
herself
pleasant
to
him
she
was
kindly
and
affectionate
presently
philip
began
to
think
he
had
been
a
fool
to
surrender
to
a
feeling
of
jealousy
after
dinner
when
they
got
into
a
hansom
to
drive
to
a
musichall
mildred
sitting
between
the
two
men
of
her
own
accord
gave
him
her
hand
his
anger
vanished
suddenly
he
knew
not
how
he
grew
conscious
that
griffiths
was
holding
her
other
hand
the
pain
seized
him
again
violently
it
was
a
real
physical
pain
and
he
asked
himself
panicstricken
what
he
might
have
asked
himself
before
whether
mildred
and
griffiths
were
in
love
with
one
another
he
could
not
see
anything
of
the
performance
on
account
of
the
mist
of
suspicion
anger
dismay
and
wretchedness
which
seemed
to
be
before
his
eyes
but
he
forced
himself
to
conceal
the
fact
that
anything
was
the
matter
he
went
on
talking
and
laughing
then
a
strange
desire
to
torture
himself
seized
him
and
he
got
up
saying
he
wanted
to
go
and
drink
something
mildred
and
griffiths
had
never
been
alone
together
for
a
moment
he
wanted
to
leave
them
by
themselves
ill
come
too
said
griffiths
ive
got
rather
a
thirst
on
oh
nonsense
you
stay
and
talk
to
mildred
philip
did
not
know
why
he
said
that
he
was
throwing
them
together
now
to
make
the
pain
he
suffered
more
intolerable
he
did
not
go
to
the
bar
but
up
into
the
balcony
from
where
he
could
watch
them
and
not
be
seen
they
had
ceased
to
look
at
the
stage
and
were
smiling
into
one
anothers
eyes
griffiths
was
talking
with
his
usual
happy
fluency
and
mildred
seemed
to
hang
on
his
lips
philips
head
began
to
ache
frightfully
he
stood
there
motionless
he
knew
he
would
be
in
the
way
if
he
went
back
they
were
enjoying
themselves
without
him
and
he
was
suffering
suffering
time
passed
and
now
he
had
an
extraordinary
shyness
about
rejoining
them
he
knew
they
had
not
thought
of
him
at
all
and
he
reflected
bitterly
that
he
had
paid
for
the
dinner
and
their
seats
in
the
musichall
what
a
fool
they
were
making
of
him
he
was
hot
with
shame
he
could
see
how
happy
they
were
without
him
his
instinct
was
to
leave
them
to
themselves
and
go
home
but
he
had
not
his
hat
and
coat
and
it
would
necessitate
endless
explanations
he
went
back
he
felt
a
shadow
of
annoyance
in
mildreds
eyes
when
she
saw
him
and
his
heart
sank
youve
been
a
devil
of
a
time
said
griffiths
with
a
smile
of
welcome
i
met
some
men
i
knew
ive
been
talking
to
them
and
i
couldnt
get
away
i
thought
youd
be
all
right
together
ive
been
enjoying
myself
thoroughly
said
griffiths
i
dont
know
about
mildred
she
gave
a
little
laugh
of
happy
complacency
there
was
a
vulgar
sound
in
the
ring
of
it
that
horrified
philip
he
suggested
that
they
should
go
come
on
said
griffiths
well
both
drive
you
home
philip
suspected
that
she
had
suggested
that
arrangement
so
that
she
might
not
be
left
alone
with
him
in
the
cab
he
did
not
take
her
hand
nor
did
she
offer
it
and
he
knew
all
the
time
that
she
was
holding
griffiths
his
chief
thought
was
that
it
was
all
so
horribly
vulgar
as
they
drove
along
he
asked
himself
what
plans
they
had
made
to
meet
without
his
knowledge
he
cursed
himself
for
having
left
them
alone
he
had
actually
gone
out
of
his
way
to
enable
them
to
arrange
things
lets
keep
the
cab
said
philip
when
they
reached
the
house
in
which
mildred
was
lodging
im
too
tired
to
walk
home
on
the
way
back
griffiths
talked
gaily
and
seemed
indifferent
to
the
fact
that
philip
answered
in
monosyllables
philip
felt
he
must
notice
that
something
was
the
matter
philips
silence
at
last
grew
too
significant
to
struggle
against
and
griffiths
suddenly
nervous
ceased
talking
philip
wanted
to
say
something
but
he
was
so
shy
he
could
hardly
bring
himself
to
and
yet
the
time
was
passing
and
the
opportunity
would
be
lost
it
was
best
to
get
at
the
truth
at
once
he
forced
himself
to
speak
are
you
in
love
with
mildred
he
asked
suddenly
i
griffiths
laughed
is
that
what
youve
been
so
funny
about
this
evening
of
course
not
my
dear
old
man
he
tried
to
slip
his
hand
through
philips
arm
but
philip
drew
himself
away
he
knew
griffiths
was
lying
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
force
griffiths
to
tell
him
that
he
had
not
been
holding
the
girls
hand
he
suddenly
felt
very
weak
and
broken
it
doesnt
matter
to
you
harry
he
said
youve
got
so
many
womendont
take
her
away
from
me
it
means
my
whole
life
ive
been
so
awfully
wretched
his
voice
broke
and
he
could
not
prevent
the
sob
that
was
torn
from
him
he
was
horribly
ashamed
of
himself
my
dear
old
boy
you
know
i
wouldnt
do
anything
to
hurt
you
im
far
too
fond
of
you
for
that
i
was
only
playing
the
fool
if
id
known
you
were
going
to
take
it
like
that
id
have
been
more
careful
is
that
true
asked
philip
i
dont
care
a
twopenny
damn
for
her
i
give
you
my
word
of
honour
philip
gave
a
sigh
of
relief
the
cab
stopped
at
their
door
chapter
lxxv
next
day
philip
was
in
a
good
temper
he
was
very
anxious
not
to
bore
mildred
with
too
much
of
his
society
and
so
had
arranged
that
he
should
not
see
her
till
dinnertime
she
was
ready
when
he
fetched
her
and
he
chaffed
her
for
her
unwonted
punctuality
she
was
wearing
a
new
dress
he
had
given
her
he
remarked
on
its
smartness
itll
have
to
go
back
and
be
altered
she
said
the
skirt
hangs
all
wrong
youll
have
to
make
the
dressmaker
hurry
up
if
you
want
to
take
it
to
paris
with
you
itll
be
ready
in
time
for
that
only
three
more
whole
days
well
go
over
by
the
eleven
oclock
shall
we
if
you
like
he
would
have
her
for
nearly
a
month
entirely
to
himself
his
eyes
rested
on
her
with
hungry
adoration
he
was
able
to
laugh
a
little
at
his
own
passion
i
wonder
what
it
is
i
see
in
you
he
smiled
thats
a
nice
thing
to
say
she
answered
her
body
was
so
thin
that
one
could
almost
see
her
skeleton
her
chest
was
as
flat
as
a
boys
her
mouth
with
its
narrow
pale
lips
was
ugly
and
her
skin
was
faintly
green
i
shall
give
you
blauds
pills
in
quantities
when
were
away
said
philip
laughing
im
going
to
bring
you
back
fat
and
rosy
i
dont
want
to
get
fat
she
said
she
did
not
speak
of
griffiths
and
presently
while
they
were
dining
philip
half
in
malice
for
he
felt
sure
of
himself
and
his
power
over
her
said
it
seems
to
me
you
were
having
a
great
flirtation
with
harry
last
night
i
told
you
i
was
in
love
with
him
she
laughed
im
glad
to
know
that
hes
not
in
love
with
you
how
dyou
know
i
asked
him
she
hesitated
a
moment
looking
at
philip
and
a
curious
gleam
came
into
her
eyes
would
you
like
to
read
a
letter
i
had
from
him
this
morning
she
handed
him
an
envelope
and
philip
recognised
griffiths
bold
legible
writing
there
were
eight
pages
it
was
well
written
frank
and
charming
it
was
the
letter
of
a
man
who
was
used
to
making
love
to
women
he
told
mildred
that
he
loved
her
passionately
he
had
fallen
in
love
with
her
the
first
moment
he
saw
her
he
did
not
want
to
love
her
for
he
knew
how
fond
philip
was
of
her
but
he
could
not
help
himself
philip
was
such
a
dear
and
he
was
very
much
ashamed
of
himself
but
it
was
not
his
fault
he
was
just
carried
away
he
paid
her
delightful
compliments
finally
he
thanked
her
for
consenting
to
lunch
with
him
next
day
and
said
he
was
dreadfully
impatient
to
see
her
philip
noticed
that
the
letter
was
dated
the
night
before
griffiths
must
have
written
it
after
leaving
philip
and
had
taken
the
trouble
to
go
out
and
post
it
when
philip
thought
he
was
in
bed
he
read
it
with
a
sickening
palpitation
of
his
heart
but
gave
no
outward
sign
of
surprise
he
handed
it
back
to
mildred
with
a
smile
calmly
did
you
enjoy
your
lunch
rather
she
said
emphatically
he
felt
that
his
hands
were
trembling
so
he
put
them
under
the
table
you
mustnt
take
griffiths
too
seriously
hes
just
a
butterfly
you
know
she
took
the
letter
and
looked
at
it
again
i
cant
help
it
either
she
said
in
a
voice
which
she
tried
to
make
nonchalant
i
dont
know
whats
come
over
me
its
a
little
awkward
for
me
isnt
it
said
philip
she
gave
him
a
quick
look
youre
taking
it
pretty
calmly
i
must
say
what
do
you
expect
me
to
do
do
you
want
me
to
tear
out
my
hair
in
handfuls
i
knew
youd
be
angry
with
me
the
funny
thing
is
im
not
at
all
i
ought
to
have
known
this
would
happen
i
was
a
fool
to
bring
you
together
i
know
perfectly
well
that
hes
got
every
advantage
over
me
hes
much
jollier
and
hes
very
handsome
hes
more
amusing
he
can
talk
to
you
about
the
things
that
interest
you
i
dont
know
what
you
mean
by
that
if
im
not
clever
i
cant
help
it
but
im
not
the
fool
you
think
i
am
not
by
a
long
way
i
can
tell
you
youre
a
bit
too
superior
for
me
my
young
friend
dyou
want
to
quarrel
with
me
he
asked
mildly
no
but
i
dont
see
why
you
should
treat
me
as
if
i
was
i
dont
know
what
im
sorry
i
didnt
mean
to
offend
you
i
just
wanted
to
talk
things
over
quietly
we
dont
want
to
make
a
mess
of
them
if
we
can
help
it
i
saw
you
were
attracted
by
him
and
it
seemed
to
me
very
natural
the
only
thing
that
really
hurts
me
is
that
he
should
have
encouraged
you
he
knew
how
awfully
keen
i
was
on
you
i
think
its
rather
shabby
of
him
to
have
written
that
letter
to
you
five
minutes
after
he
told
me
he
didnt
care
twopence
about
you
if
you
think
youre
going
to
make
me
like
him
any
the
less
by
saying
nasty
things
about
him
youre
mistaken
philip
was
silent
for
a
moment
he
did
not
know
what
words
he
could
use
to
make
her
see
his
point
of
view
he
wanted
to
speak
coolly
and
deliberately
but
he
was
in
such
a
turmoil
of
emotion
that
he
could
not
clear
his
thoughts
its
not
worth
while
sacrificing
everything
for
an
infatuation
that
you
know
cant
last
after
all
he
doesnt
care
for
anyone
more
than
ten
days
and
youre
rather
cold
that
sort
of
thing
doesnt
mean
very
much
to
you
thats
what
you
think
she
made
it
more
difficult
for
him
by
adopting
a
cantankerous
tone
if
youre
in
love
with
him
you
cant
help
it
ill
just
bear
it
as
best
i
can
we
get
on
very
well
together
you
and
i
and
ive
not
behaved
badly
to
you
have
i
ive
always
known
that
youre
not
in
love
with
me
but
you
like
me
all
right
and
when
we
get
over
to
paris
youll
forget
about
griffiths
if
you
make
up
your
mind
to
put
him
out
of
your
thoughts
you
wont
find
it
so
hard
as
all
that
and
ive
deserved
that
you
should
do
something
for
me
she
did
not
answer
and
they
went
on
eating
their
dinner
when
the
silence
grew
oppressive
philip
began
to
talk
of
indifferent
things
he
pretended
not
to
notice
that
mildred
was
inattentive
her
answers
were
perfunctory
and
she
volunteered
no
remarks
of
her
own
at
last
she
interrupted
abruptly
what
he
was
saying
philip
im
afraid
i
shant
be
able
to
go
away
on
saturday
the
doctor
says
i
oughtnt
to
he
knew
this
was
not
true
but
he
answered
when
will
you
be
able
to
come
away
she
glanced
at
him
saw
that
his
face
was
white
and
rigid
and
looked
nervously
away
she
was
at
that
moment
a
little
afraid
of
him
i
may
as
well
tell
you
and
have
done
with
it
i
cant
come
away
with
you
at
all
i
thought
you
were
driving
at
that
its
too
late
to
change
your
mind
now
ive
got
the
tickets
and
everything
you
said
you
didnt
wish
me
to
go
unless
i
wanted
it
too
and
i
dont
ive
changed
my
mind
im
not
going
to
have
any
more
tricks
played
with
me
you
must
come
i
like
you
very
much
philip
as
a
friend
but
i
cant
bear
to
think
of
anything
else
i
dont
like
you
that
way
i
couldnt
philip
you
were
quite
willing
to
a
week
ago
it
was
different
then
you
hadnt
met
griffiths
you
said
yourself
i
couldnt
help
it
if
im
in
love
with
him
her
face
was
set
into
a
sulky
look
and
she
kept
her
eyes
fixed
on
her
plate
philip
was
white
with
rage
he
would
have
liked
to
hit
her
in
the
face
with
his
clenched
fist
and
in
fancy
he
saw
how
she
would
look
with
a
black
eye
there
were
two
lads
of
eighteen
dining
at
a
table
near
them
and
now
and
then
they
looked
at
mildred
he
wondered
if
they
envied
him
dining
with
a
pretty
girl
perhaps
they
were
wishing
they
stood
in
his
shoes
it
was
mildred
who
broke
the
silence
whats
the
good
of
our
going
away
together
id
be
thinking
of
him
all
the
time
it
wouldnt
be
much
fun
for
you
thats
my
business
he
answered
she
thought
over
all
his
reply
implicated
and
she
reddened
but
thats
just
beastly
what
of
it
i
thought
you
were
a
gentleman
in
every
sense
of
the
word
you
were
mistaken
his
reply
entertained
him
and
he
laughed
as
he
said
it
for
gods
sake
dont
laugh
she
cried
i
cant
come
away
with
you
philip
im
awfully
sorry
i
know
i
havent
behaved
well
to
you
but
one
cant
force
themselves
have
you
forgotten
that
when
you
were
in
trouble
i
did
everything
for
you
i
planked
out
the
money
to
keep
you
till
your
baby
was
born
i
paid
for
your
doctor
and
everything
i
paid
for
you
to
go
to
brighton
and
im
paying
for
the
keep
of
your
baby
im
paying
for
your
clothes
im
paying
for
every
stitch
youve
got
on
now
if
you
was
a
gentleman
you
wouldnt
throw
what
youve
done
for
me
in
my
face
oh
for
goodness
sake
shut
up
what
dyou
suppose
i
care
if
im
a
gentleman
or
not
if
i
were
a
gentleman
i
shouldnt
waste
my
time
with
a
vulgar
slut
like
you
i
dont
care
a
damn
if
you
like
me
or
not
im
sick
of
being
made
a
blasted
fool
of
youre
jolly
well
coming
to
paris
with
me
on
saturday
or
you
can
take
the
consequences
her
cheeks
were
red
with
anger
and
when
she
answered
her
voice
had
the
hard
commonness
which
she
concealed
generally
by
a
genteel
enunciation
i
never
liked
you
not
from
the
beginning
but
you
forced
yourself
on
me
i
always
hated
it
when
you
kissed
me
i
wouldnt
let
you
touch
me
now
not
if
i
was
starving
philip
tried
to
swallow
the
food
on
his
plate
but
the
muscles
of
his
throat
refused
to
act
he
gulped
down
something
to
drink
and
lit
a
cigarette
he
was
trembling
in
every
part
he
did
not
speak
he
waited
for
her
to
move
but
she
sat
in
silence
staring
at
the
white
tablecloth
if
they
had
been
alone
he
would
have
flung
his
arms
round
her
and
kissed
her
passionately
he
fancied
the
throwing
back
of
her
long
white
throat
as
he
pressed
upon
her
mouth
with
his
lips
they
passed
an
hour
without
speaking
and
at
last
philip
thought
the
waiter
began
to
stare
at
them
curiously
he
called
for
the
bill
shall
we
go
he
said
then
in
an
even
tone
she
did
not
reply
but
gathered
together
her
bag
and
her
gloves
she
put
on
her
coat
when
are
you
seeing
griffiths
again
tomorrow
she
answered
indifferently
youd
better
talk
it
over
with
him
she
opened
her
bag
mechanically
and
saw
a
piece
of
paper
in
it
she
took
it
out
heres
the
bill
for
this
dress
she
said
hesitatingly
what
of
it
i
promised
id
give
her
the
money
tomorrow
did
you
does
that
mean
you
wont
pay
for
it
after
having
told
me
i
could
get
it
it
does
ill
ask
harry
she
said
flushing
quickly
hell
be
glad
to
help
you
he
owes
me
seven
pounds
at
the
moment
and
he
pawned
his
microscope
last
week
because
he
was
so
broke
you
neednt
think
you
can
frighten
me
by
that
im
quite
capable
of
earning
my
own
living
its
the
best
thing
you
can
do
i
dont
propose
to
give
you
a
farthing
more
she
thought
of
her
rent
due
on
saturday
and
the
babys
keep
but
did
not
say
anything
they
left
the
restaurant
and
in
the
street
philip
asked
her
shall
i
call
a
cab
for
you
im
going
to
take
a
little
stroll
i
havent
got
any
money
i
had
to
pay
a
bill
this
afternoon
it
wont
hurt
you
to
walk
if
you
want
to
see
me
tomorrow
i
shall
be
in
about
teatime
he
took
off
his
hat
and
sauntered
away
he
looked
round
in
a
moment
and
saw
that
she
was
standing
helplessly
where
he
had
left
her
looking
at
the
traffic
he
went
back
and
with
a
laugh
pressed
a
coin
into
her
hand
heres
two
bob
for
you
to
get
home
with
before
she
could
speak
he
hurried
away
chapter
lxxvi
next
day
in
the
afternoon
philip
sat
in
his
room
and
wondered
whether
mildred
would
come
he
had
slept
badly
he
had
spent
the
morning
in
the
club
of
the
medical
school
reading
one
newspaper
after
another
it
was
the
vacation
and
few
students
he
knew
were
in
london
but
he
found
one
or
two
people
to
talk
to
he
played
a
game
of
chess
and
so
wore
out
the
tedious
hours
after
luncheon
he
felt
so
tired
his
head
was
aching
so
that
he
went
back
to
his
lodgings
and
lay
down
he
tried
to
read
a
novel
he
had
not
seen
griffiths
he
was
not
in
when
philip
returned
the
night
before
he
heard
him
come
back
but
he
did
not
as
usual
look
into
philips
room
to
see
if
he
was
asleep
and
in
the
morning
philip
heard
him
go
out
early
it
was
clear
that
he
wanted
to
avoid
him
suddenly
there
was
a
light
tap
at
his
door
philip
sprang
to
his
feet
and
opened
it
mildred
stood
on
the
threshold
she
did
not
move
come
in
said
philip
he
closed
the
door
after
her
she
sat
down
she
hesitated
to
begin
thank
you
for
giving
me
that
two
shillings
last
night
she
said
oh
thats
all
right
she
gave
him
a
faint
smile
it
reminded
philip
of
the
timid
ingratiating
look
of
a
puppy
that
has
been
beaten
for
naughtiness
and
wants
to
reconcile
himself
with
his
master
ive
been
lunching
with
harry
she
said
have
you
if
you
still
want
me
to
go
away
with
you
on
saturday
philip
ill
come
a
quick
thrill
of
triumph
shot
through
his
heart
but
it
was
a
sensation
that
only
lasted
an
instant
it
was
followed
by
a
suspicion
because
of
the
money
he
asked
partly
she
answered
simply
harry
cant
do
anything
he
owes
five
weeks
here
and
he
owes
you
seven
pounds
and
his
tailors
pressing
him
for
money
hed
pawn
anything
he
could
but
hes
pawned
everything
already
i
had
a
job
to
put
the
woman
off
about
my
new
dress
and
on
saturday
theres
the
book
at
my
lodgings
and
i
cant
get
work
in
five
minutes
it
always
means
waiting
some
little
time
till
theres
a
vacancy
she
said
all
this
in
an
even
querulous
tone
as
though
she
were
recounting
the
injustices
of
fate
which
had
to
be
borne
as
part
of
the
natural
order
of
things
philip
did
not
answer
he
knew
what
she
told
him
well
enough
you
said
partly
he
observed
at
last
well
harry
says
youve
been
a
brick
to
both
of
us
youve
been
a
real
good
friend
to
him
he
says
and
youve
done
for
me
what
praps
no
other
man
would
have
done
we
must
do
the
straight
thing
he
says
and
he
said
what
you
said
about
him
that
hes
fickle
by
nature
hes
not
like
you
and
i
should
be
a
fool
to
throw
you
away
for
him
he
wont
last
and
you
will
he
says
so
himself
dyou
want
to
come
away
with
me
asked
philip
i
dont
mind
he
looked
at
her
and
the
corners
of
his
mouth
turned
down
in
an
expression
of
misery
he
had
triumphed
indeed
and
he
was
going
to
have
his
way
he
gave
a
little
laugh
of
derision
at
his
own
humiliation
she
looked
at
him
quickly
but
did
not
speak
ive
looked
forward
with
all
my
soul
to
going
away
with
you
and
i
thought
at
last
after
all
that
wretchedness
i
was
going
to
be
happy
he
did
not
finish
what
he
was
going
to
say
and
then
on
a
sudden
without
warning
mildred
broke
into
a
storm
of
tears
she
was
sitting
in
the
chair
in
which
norah
had
sat
and
wept
and
like
her
she
hid
her
face
on
the
back
of
it
towards
the
side
where
there
was
a
little
bump
formed
by
the
sagging
in
the
middle
where
the
head
had
rested
im
not
lucky
with
women
thought
philip
her
thin
body
was
shaken
with
sobs
philip
had
never
seen
a
woman
cry
with
such
an
utter
abandonment
it
was
horribly
painful
and
his
heart
was
torn
without
realising
what
he
did
he
went
up
to
her
and
put
his
arms
round
her
she
did
not
resist
but
in
her
wretchedness
surrendered
herself
to
his
comforting
he
whispered
to
her
little
words
of
solace
he
scarcely
knew
what
he
was
saying
he
bent
over
her
and
kissed
her
repeatedly
are
you
awfully
unhappy
he
said
at
last
i
wish
i
was
dead
she
moaned
i
wish
id
died
when
the
baby
come
her
hat
was
in
her
way
and
philip
took
it
off
for
her
he
placed
her
head
more
comfortably
in
the
chair
and
then
he
went
and
sat
down
at
the
table
and
looked
at
her
it
is
awful
love
isnt
it
he
said
fancy
anyone
wanting
to
be
in
love
presently
the
violence
of
her
sobbing
diminished
and
she
sat
in
the
chair
exhausted
with
her
head
thrown
back
and
her
arms
hanging
by
her
side
she
had
the
grotesque
look
of
one
of
those
painters
dummies
used
to
hang
draperies
on
i
didnt
know
you
loved
him
so
much
as
all
that
said
philip
he
understood
griffiths
love
well
enough
for
he
put
himself
in
griffiths
place
and
saw
with
his
eyes
touched
with
his
hands
he
was
able
to
think
himself
in
griffiths
body
and
he
kissed
her
with
his
lips
smiled
at
her
with
his
smiling
blue
eyes
it
was
her
emotion
that
surprised
him
he
had
never
thought
her
capable
of
passion
and
this
was
passion
there
was
no
mistaking
it
something
seemed
to
give
way
in
his
heart
it
really
felt
to
him
as
though
something
were
breaking
and
he
felt
strangely
weak
i
dont
want
to
make
you
unhappy
you
neednt
come
away
with
me
if
you
dont
want
to
ill
give
you
the
money
all
the
same
she
shook
her
head
no
i
said
id
come
and
ill
come
whats
the
good
if
youre
sick
with
love
for
him
yes
thats
the
word
im
sick
with
love
i
know
it
wont
last
just
as
well
as
he
does
but
just
now
she
paused
and
shut
her
eyes
as
though
she
were
going
to
faint
a
strange
idea
came
to
philip
and
he
spoke
it
as
it
came
without
stopping
to
think
it
out
why
dont
you
go
away
with
him
how
can
i
you
know
we
havent
got
the
money
ill
give
you
the
money
you
she
sat
up
and
looked
at
him
her
eyes
began
to
shine
and
the
colour
came
into
her
cheeks
perhaps
the
best
thing
would
be
to
get
it
over
and
then
youd
come
back
to
me
now
that
he
had
made
the
suggestion
he
was
sick
with
anguish
and
yet
the
torture
of
it
gave
him
a
strange
subtle
sensation
she
stared
at
him
with
open
eyes
oh
how
could
we
on
your
money
harry
wouldnt
think
of
it
oh
yes
he
would
if
you
persuaded
him
her
objections
made
him
insist
and
yet
he
wanted
her
with
all
his
heart
to
refuse
vehemently
ill
give
you
a
fiver
and
you
can
go
away
from
saturday
to
monday
you
could
easily
do
that
on
monday

going
home
till
he
takes
up
his
appointment
at
the
north
london
oh
philip

that
she
cried
clasping
her
hands
if
you
could
only
let

goi

love
you
so
much
afterwards

anything

you

shall
get
over
it
if
youll
only
do
that
would
you
really
give
us
the
money
yes
he
said
she
was
entirely
changed
now
she
began
to
laugh
he
could
see
that
she
was
insanely
happy
she
got
up
and
knelt
down
by
philips
side
taking
his
hands
you
are
a
brick
philip
youre
the
best
fellow
ive
ever
known
wont
you
be
angry
with
me
afterwards
he
shook
his
head
smiling
but
with
what
agony
in
his
heart
may
i
go
and
tell
harry
now
and
can
i
say
to
him
that
you
dont
mind
he
wont
consent

you
promise
it
doesnt
matter
oh

know
how
i
love
him
and
afterwards
ill
do
anything
you
like
ill
come
over
to
paris
with
you
or
anywhere
on

she
got
up
and
put
on
her
hat
where
are
you
going
im
going
to
ask
him
if
hell
take
me
already
dyou
want
me
to
stay
ill
stay
if
you
like
she
sat
down
but
he
gave
a
little
laugh
no
it
doesnt
matter
youd
better
go
at
once
theres
only
one
thing
i
cant
bear
to
see
griffiths
just
now
it
would
hurt
me
too
awfully
say
i
have
no
illfeeling
towards
him
or
anything
like
that
but
ask
him
to
keep
out
of
my
way
all
right
she
sprang
up
and
put
on
her
gloves
ill
let
you
know
what
he
says
youd
better
dine
with
me
tonight
very
well
she
put
up
her
face
for
him
to
kiss
her
and
when
he
pressed
his
lips
to
hers
she
threw
her
arms
round
his
neck
you
are
a
darling
philip
she
sent
him
a
note
a
couple
of
hours
later
to
say
that
she
had
a
headache
and
could
not
dine
with
him
philip
had
almost
expected
it
he
knew
that
she
was
dining
with
griffiths
he
was
horribly
jealous
but
the
sudden
passion
which
had
seized
the
pair
of
them
seemed
like
something
that
had
come
from
the
outside
as
though
a
god
had
visited
them
with
it
and
he
felt
himself
helpless
it
seemed
so
natural
that
they
should
love
one
another
he
saw
all
the
advantages
that
griffiths
had
over
himself
and
confessed
that
in
mildreds
place
he
would
have
done
as
mildred
did
what
hurt
him
most
was
griffiths
treachery
they
had
been
such
good
friends
and
griffiths
knew
how
passionately
devoted
he
was
to
mildred
he
might
have
spared
him
he
did
not
see
mildred
again
till
friday
he
was
sick
for
a
sight
of
her
by
then
but
when
she
came
and
he
realised
that
he
had
gone
out
of
her
thoughts
entirely
for
they
were
engrossed
in
griffiths
he
suddenly
hated
her
he
saw
now
why
she
and
griffiths
loved
one
another
griffiths
was
stupid
oh
so
stupid
he
had
known
that
all
along
but
had
shut
his
eyes
to
it
stupid
and
emptyheaded
that
charm
of
his
concealed
an
utter
selfishness
he
was
willing
to
sacrifice
anyone
to
his
appetites
and
how
inane
was
the
life
he
led
lounging
about
bars
and
drinking
in
music
halls
wandering
from
one
light
amour
to
another
he
never
read
a
book
he
was
blind
to
everything
that
was
not
frivolous
and
vulgar
he
had
never
a
thought
that
was
fine
the
word
most
common
on
his
lips
was
smart
that
was
his
highest
praise
for
man
or
woman
smart
it
was
no
wonder
he
pleased
mildred
they
suited
one
another
philip
talked
to
mildred
of
things
that
mattered
to
neither
of
them
he
knew
she
wanted
to
speak
of
griffiths
but
he
gave
her
no
opportunity
he
did
not
refer
to
the
fact
that
two
evenings
before
she
had
put
off
dining
with
him
on
a
trivial
excuse
he
was
casual
with
her
trying
to
make
her
think
he
was
suddenly
grown
indifferent
and
he
exercised
peculiar
skill
in
saying
little
things
which
he
knew
would
wound
her
but
which
were
so
indefinite
so
delicately
cruel
that
she
could
not
take
exception
to
them
at
last
she
got
up
i
think
i
must
be
going
off
now
she
said
i
daresay
youve
got
a
lot
to
do
he
answered
she
held
out
her
hand
he
took
it
said
goodbye
and
opened
the
door
for
her
he
knew
what
she
wanted
to
speak
about
and
he
knew
also
that
his
cold
ironical
air
intimidated
her
often
his
shyness
made
him
seem
so
frigid
that
unintentionally
he
frightened
people
and
having
discovered
this
he
was
able
when
occasion
arose
to
assume
the
same
manner
you
havent
forgotten
what
you
promised
she
said
at
last
as
he
held
open
the
door
what
is
that
about
the
money
how
much
dyou
want
he
spoke
with
an
icy
deliberation
which
made
his
words
peculiarly
offensive
mildred
flushed
he
knew
she
hated
him
at
that
moment
and
he
wondered
at
the
selfcontrol
by
which
she
prevented
herself
from
flying
out
at
him
he
wanted
to
make
her
suffer
theres
the
dress
and
the
book
tomorrow
thats
all
harry
wont
come
so
we
shant
want
money
for
that
philips
heart
gave
a
great
thud
against
his
ribs
and
he
let
the
door
handle
go
the
door
swung
to
why
not
he
says
we
couldnt
not
on
your
money
a
devil
seized
philip
a
devil
of
selftorture
which
was
always
lurking
within
him
and
though
with
all
his
soul
he
wished
that
griffiths
and
mildred
should
not
go
away
together
he
could
not
help
himself
he
set
himself
to
persuade
griffiths
through
her
i
dont
see
why
not
if
im
willing
he
said
thats
what
i
told
him
i
should
have
thought
if
he
really
wanted
to
go
he
wouldnt
hesitate
oh
its
not
that
he
wants
to
all
right
hed
go
at
once
if
he
had
the
money
if
hes
squeamish
about
it
ill
give
you
the
money
i
said
youd
lend
it
if
he
liked
and
wed
pay
it
back
as
soon
as
we
could
its
rather
a
change
for
you
going
on
your
knees
to
get
a
man
to
take
you
away
for
a
weekend
it
is
rather
isnt
it
she
said
with
a
shameless
little
laugh
it
sent
a
cold
shudder
down
philips
spine
what
are
you
going
to
do
then
he
asked
nothing
hes
going
home
tomorrow
he
must
that
would
be
philips
salvation
with
griffiths
out
of
the
way
he
could
get
mildred
back
she
knew
no
one
in
london
she
would
be
thrown
on
to
his
society
and
when
they
were
alone
together
he
could
soon
make
her
forget
this
infatuation
if
he
said
nothing
more
he
was
safe
but
he
had
a
fiendish
desire
to
break
down
their
scruples
he
wanted
to
know
how
abominably
they
could
behave
towards
him
if
he
tempted
them
a
little
more
they
would
yield
and
he
took
a
fierce
joy
at
the
thought
of
their
dishonour
though
every
word
he
spoke
tortured
him
he
found
in
the
torture
a
horrible
delight
it
looks
as
if
it
were
now
or
never
thats
what
i
told
him
she
said
there
was
a
passionate
note
in
her
voice
which
struck
philip
he
was
biting
his
nails
in
his
nervousness
where
were
you
thinking
of
going
oh
to
oxford
he
was
at
the
varsity
there
you
know
he
said
hed
show
me
the
colleges
philip
remembered
that
once
he
had
suggested
going
to
oxford
for
the
day
and
she
had
expressed
firmly
the
boredom
she
felt
at
the
thought
of
sights
and
it
looks
as
if
youd
have
fine
weather
it
ought
to
be
very
jolly
there
just
now
ive
done
all
i
could
to
persuade
him
why
dont
you
have
another
try
shall
i
say
you
want
us
to
go
i
dont
think
you
must
go
as
far
as
that
said
philip
she
paused
for
a
minute
or
two
looking
at
him
philip
forced
himself
to
look
at
her
in
a
friendly
way
he
hated
her
he
despised
her
he
loved
her
with
all
his
heart
ill
tell
you
what
ill
do
ill
go
and
see
if
he
cant
arrange
it
and
then
if
he
says
yes
ill
come
and
fetch
the
money
tomorrow
when
shall
you
be
in
ill
come
back
here
after
luncheon
and
wait
all
right
ill
give
you
the
money
for
your
dress
and
your
room
now
he
went
to
his
desk
and
took
out
what
money
he
had
the
dress
was
six
guineas
there
was
besides
her
rent
and
her
food
and
the
babys
keep
for
a
week
he
gave
her
eight
pounds
ten
thanks
very
much
she
said
she
left
him
chapter
lxxvii
after
lunching
in
the
basement
of
the
medical
school
philip
went
back
to
his
rooms
it
was
saturday
afternoon
and
the
landlady
was
cleaning
the
stairs
is
mr
griffiths
in
he
asked
no
sir
he
went
away
this
morning
soon
after
you
went
out
isnt
he
coming
back
i
dont
think
so
sir
hes
taken
his
luggage
philip
wondered
what
this
could
mean
he
took
a
book
and
began
to
read
it
was
burtons
journey
to
meccah
which
he
had
just
got
out
of
the
westminster
public
library
and
he
read
the
first
page
but
could
make
no
sense
of
it
for
his
mind
was
elsewhere
he
was
listening
all
the
time
for
a
ring
at
the
bell
he
dared
not
hope
that
griffiths
had
gone
away
already
without
mildred
to
his
home
in
cumberland
mildred
would
be
coming
presently
for
the
money
he
set
his
teeth
and
read
on
he
tried
desperately
to
concentrate
his
attention
the
sentences
etched
themselves
in
his
brain
by
the
force
of
his
effort
but
they
were
distorted
by
the
agony
he
was
enduring
he
wished
with
all
his
heart
that
he
had
not
made
the
horrible
proposition
to
give
them
money
but
now
that
he
had
made
it
he
lacked
the
strength
to
go
back
on
it
not
on
mildreds
account
but
on
his
own
there
was
a
morbid
obstinacy
in
him
which
forced
him
to
do
the
thing
he
had
determined
he
discovered
that
the
three
pages
he
had
read
had
made
no
impression
on
him
at
all
and
he
went
back
and
started
from
the
beginning
he
found
himself
reading
one
sentence
over
and
over
again
and
now
it
weaved
itself
in
with
his
thoughts
horribly
like
some
formula
in
a
nightmare
one
thing
he
could
do
was
to
go
out
and
keep
away
till
midnight
they
could
not
go
then
and
he
saw
them
calling
at
the
house
every
hour
to
ask
if
he
was
in
he
enjoyed
the
thought
of
their
disappointment
he
repeated
that
sentence
to
himself
mechanically
but
he
could
not
do
that
let
them
come
and
take
the
money
and
he
would
know
then
to
what
depths
of
infamy
it
was
possible
for
men
to
descend
he
could
not
read
any
more
now
he
simply
could
not
see
the
words
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
closing
his
eyes
and
numb
with
misery
waited
for
mildred
the
landlady
came
in
will
you
see
mrs
miller
sir
show
her
in
philip
pulled
himself
together
to
receive
her
without
any
sign
of
what
he
was
feeling
he
had
an
impulse
to
throw
himself
on
his
knees
and
seize
her
hands
and
beg
her
not
to
go
but
he
knew
there
was
no
way
of
moving
her
she
would
tell
griffiths
what
he
had
said
and
how
he
acted
he
was
ashamed
well
how
about
the
little
jaunt
he
said
gaily
were
going
harrys
outside
i
told
him
you
didnt
want
to
see
him
so
hes
kept
out
of
your
way
but
he
wants
to
know
if
he
can
come
in
just
for
a
minute
to
say
goodbye
to
you
no
i
wont
see
him
said
philip
he
could
see
she
did
not
care
if
he
saw
griffiths
or
not
now
that
she
was
there
he
wanted
her
to
go
quickly
look
here
heres
the
fiver
id
like
you
to
go
now
she
took
it
and
thanked
him
she
turned
to
leave
the
room
when
are
you
coming
back
he
asked
oh
on
monday
harry
must
go
home
then
he
knew
what
he
was
going
to
say
was
humiliating
but
he
was
broken
down
with
jealousy
and
desire
then
i
shall
see
you
shant
i
he
could
not
help
the
note
of
appeal
in
his
voice
of
course
ill
let
you
know
the
moment
im
back
he
shook
hands
with
her
through
the
curtains
he
watched
her
jump
into
a
fourwheeler
that
stood
at
the
door
it
rolled
away
then
he
threw
himself
on
his
bed
and
hid
his
face
in
his
hands
he
felt
tears
coming
to
his
eyes
and
he
was
angry
with
himself
he
clenched
his
hands
and
screwed
up
his
body
to
prevent
them
but
he
could
not
and
great
painful
sobs
were
forced
from
him
he
got
up
at
last
exhausted
and
ashamed
and
washed
his
face
he
mixed
himself
a
strong
whiskey
and
soda
it
made
him
feel
a
little
better
then
he
caught
sight
of
the
tickets
to
paris
which
were
on
the
chimneypiece
and
seizing
them
with
an
impulse
of
rage
he
flung
them
in
the
fire
he
knew
he
could
have
got
the
money
back
on
them
but
it
relieved
him
to
destroy
them
then
he
went
out
in
search
of
someone
to
be
with
the
club
was
empty
he
felt
he
would
go
mad
unless
he
found
someone
to
talk
to
but
lawson
was
abroad
he
went
on
to
haywards
rooms
the
maid
who
opened
the
door
told
him
that
he
had
gone
down
to
brighton
for
the
weekend
then
philip
went
to
a
gallery
and
found
it
was
just
closing
he
did
not
know
what
to
do
he
was
distracted
and
he
thought
of
griffiths
and
mildred
going
to
oxford
sitting
opposite
one
another
in
the
train
happy
he
went
back
to
his
rooms
but
they
filled
him
with
horror
he
had
been
so
wretched
in
them
he
tried
once
more
to
read
burtons
book
but
as
he
read
he
told
himself
again
and
again
what
a
fool
he
had
been
it
was
he
who
had
made
the
suggestion
that
they
should
go
away
he
had
offered
the
money
he
had
forced
it
upon
them
he
might
have
known
what
would
happen
when
he
introduced
griffiths
to
mildred
his
own
vehement
passion
was
enough
to
arouse
the
others
desire
by
this
time
they
had
reached
oxford
they
would
put
up
in
one
of
the
lodginghouses
in
john
street
philip
had
never
been
to
oxford
but
griffiths
had
talked
to
him
about
it
so
much
that
he
knew
exactly
where
they
would
go
and
they
would
dine
at
the
clarendon
griffiths
had
been
in
the
habit
of
dining
there
when
he
went
on
the
spree
philip
got
himself
something
to
eat
in
a
restaurant
near
charing
cross
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
go
to
a
play
and
afterwards
he
fought
his
way
into
the
pit
of
a
theatre
at
which
one
of
oscar
wildes
pieces
was
being
performed
he
wondered
if
mildred
and
griffiths
would
go
to
a
play
that
evening
they
must
kill
the
evening
somehow
they
were
too
stupid
both
of
them
to
content
themselves
with
conversation
he
got
a
fierce
delight
in
reminding
himself
of
the
vulgarity
of
their
minds
which
suited
them
so
exactly
to
one
another
he
watched
the
play
with
an
abstracted
mind
trying
to
give
himself
gaiety
by
drinking
whiskey
in
each
interval
he
was
unused
to
alcohol
and
it
affected
him
quickly
but
his
drunkenness
was
savage
and
morose
when
the
play
was
over
he
had
another
drink
he
could
not
go
to
bed
he
knew
he
would
not
sleep
and
he
dreaded
the
pictures
which
his
vivid
imagination
would
place
before
him
he
tried
not
to
think
of
them
he
knew
he
had
drunk
too
much
now
he
was
seized
with
a
desire
to
do
horrible
sordid
things
he
wanted
to
roll
himself
in
gutters
his
whole
being
yearned
for
beastliness
he
wanted
to
grovel
he
walked
up
piccadilly
dragging
his
clubfoot
sombrely
drunk
with
rage
and
misery
clawing
at
his
heart
he
was
stopped
by
a
painted
harlot
who
put
her
hand
on
his
arm
he
pushed
her
violently
away
with
brutal
words
he
walked
on
a
few
steps
and
then
stopped
she
would
do
as
well
as
another
he
was
sorry
he
had
spoken
so
roughly
to
her
he
went
up
to
her
i
say
he
began
go
to
hell
she
said
philip
laughed
i
merely
wanted
to
ask
if
youd
do
me
the
honour
of
supping
with
me
tonight
she
looked
at
him
with
amazement
and
hesitated
for
a
while
she
saw
he
was
drunk
i
dont
mind
he
was
amused
that
she
should
use
a
phrase
he
had
heard
so
often
on
mildreds
lips
he
took
her
to
one
of
the
restaurants
he
had
been
in
the
habit
of
going
to
with
mildred
he
noticed
as
they
walked
along
that
she
looked
down
at
his
limb
ive
got
a
clubfoot
he
said
have
you
any
objection
you
are
a
cure
she
laughed
when
he
got
home
his
bones
were
aching
and
in
his
head
there
was
a
hammering
that
made
him
nearly
scream
he
took
another
whiskey
and
soda
to
steady
himself
and
going
to
bed
sank
into
a
dreamless
sleep
till
midday
chapter
lxxviii
at
last
monday
came
and
philip
thought
his
long
torture
was
over
looking
out
the
trains
he
found
that
the
latest
by
which
griffiths
could
reach
home
that
night
left
oxford
soon
after
one
and
he
supposed
that
mildred
would
take
one
which
started
a
few
minutes
later
to
bring
her
to
london
his
desire
was
to
go
and
meet
it
but
he
thought
mildred
would
like
to
be
left
alone
for
a
day
perhaps
she
would
drop
him
a
line
in
the
evening
to
say
she
was
back
and
if
not
he
would
call
at
her
lodgings
next
morning
his
spirit
was
cowed
he
felt
a
bitter
hatred
for
griffiths
but
for
mildred
notwithstanding
all
that
had
passed
only
a
heartrending
desire
he
was
glad
now
that
hayward
was
not
in
london
on
saturday
afternoon
when
distraught
he
went
in
search
of
human
comfort
he
could
not
have
prevented
himself
from
telling
him
everything
and
hayward
would
have
been
astonished
at
his
weakness
he
would
despise
him
and
perhaps
be
shocked
or
disgusted
that
he
could
envisage
the
possibility
of
making
mildred
his
mistress
after
she
had
given
herself
to
another
man
what
did
he
care
if
it
was
shocking
or
disgusting
he
was
ready
for
any
compromise
prepared
for
more
degrading
humiliations
still
if
he
could
only
gratify
his
desire
towards
the
evening
his
steps
took
him
against
his
will
to
the
house
in
which
she
lived
and
he
looked
up
at
her
window
it
was
dark
he
did
not
venture
to
ask
if
she
was
back
he
was
confident
in
her
promise
but
there
was
no
letter
from
her
in
the
morning
and
when
about
midday
he
called
the
maid
told
him
she
had
not
arrived
he
could
not
understand
it
he
knew
that
griffiths
would
have
been
obliged
to
go
home
the
day
before
for
he
was
to
be
best
man
at
a
wedding
and
mildred
had
no
money
he
turned
over
in
his
mind
every
possible
thing
that
might
have
happened
he
went
again
in
the
afternoon
and
left
a
note
asking
her
to
dine
with
him
that
evening
as
calmly
as
though
the
events
of
the
last
fortnight
had
not
happened
he
mentioned
the
place
and
time
at
which
they
were
to
meet
and
hoping
against
hope
kept
the
appointment
though
he
waited
for
an
hour
she
did
not
come
on
wednesday
morning
he
was
ashamed
to
ask
at
the
house
and
sent
a
messengerboy
with
a
letter
and
instructions
to
bring
back
a
reply
but
in
an
hour
the
boy
came
back
with
philips
letter
unopened
and
the
answer
that
the
lady
had
not
returned
from
the
country
philip
was
beside
himself
the
last
deception
was
more
than
he
could
bear
he
repeated
to
himself
over
and
over
again
that
he
loathed
mildred
and
ascribing
to
griffiths
this
new
disappointment
he
hated
him
so
much
that
he
knew
what
was
the
delight
of
murder
he
walked
about
considering
what
a
joy
it
would
be
to
come
upon
him
on
a
dark
night
and
stick
a
knife
into
his
throat
just
about
the
carotid
artery
and
leave
him
to
die
in
the
street
like
a
dog
philip
was
out
of
his
senses
with
grief
and
rage
he
did
not
like
whiskey
but
he
drank
to
stupefy
himself
he
went
to
bed
drunk
on
the
tuesday
and
on
the
wednesday
night
on
thursday
morning
he
got
up
very
late
and
dragged
himself
bleareyed
and
sallow
into
his
sittingroom
to
see
if
there
were
any
letters
a
curious
feeling
shot
through
his
heart
when
he
recognised
the
handwriting
of
griffiths
dear
old
man
i
hardly
know
how
to
write
to
you
and
yet
i
feel
i
must
write

not
awfully
angry
with
me
i
know
i
oughtnt
to
have
gone
away
with
milly
but
i
simply
couldnt
help
myself
she
simply
carried
me
off
my
feet
and
i
would
have
done
anything
to
get
her
when
she
told
me
you
had
offered
us
the
money
to
go
i
simply
couldnt
resist
and
now
its
all
over
im
awfully
ashamed
of
myself
and
i
wish
i
hadnt
been
such
a
fool
i
wish
youd
write
and
say
youre
not
angry
with
me
and
i
want
you
to
let

line

a
good
chap
and
tell

i
came
home
on
monday
and
milly
wanted
to
stay
a
couple
of
days
at
oxford
by

to
london
on

i
hope
everything
will
go
off
all
right
do
write
and
say
you
forgive
me
please
write
at
once
yours
ever
harry
philip
tore
up
the
letter
furiously
he
did
not
mean
to
answer
it
he
despised
griffiths
for
his
apologies
he
had
no
patience
with
his
prickings
of
conscience
one
could
do
a
dastardly
thing
if
one
chose
but
it
was
contemptible
to
regret
it
afterwards
he
thought
the
letter
cowardly
and
hypocritical
he
was
disgusted
at
its
sentimentality
it
would
be
very
easy
if
you
could
do
a
beastly
thing
he
muttered
to
himself
and
then
say
you
were
sorry
and
that
put
it
all
right
again
he
hoped
with
all
his
heart
he
would
have
the
chance
one
day
to
do
griffiths
a
bad
turn
but
at
all
events
he
knew
that
mildred
was
in
town
he
dressed
hurriedly
not
waiting
to
shave
drank
a
cup
of
tea
and
took
a
cab
to
her
rooms
the
cab
seemed
to
crawl
he
was
painfully
anxious
to
see
her
and
unconsciously
he
uttered
a
prayer
to
the
god
he
did
not
believe
in
to
make
her
receive
him
kindly
he
only
wanted
to
forget
with
beating
heart
he
rang
the
bell
he
forgot
all
his
suffering
in
the
passionate
desire
to
enfold
her
once
more
in
his
arms
is
mrs
miller
in
he
asked
joyously
shes
gone
the
maid
answered
he
looked
at
her
blankly
she
came
about
an
hour
ago
and
took
away
her
things
for
a
moment
he
did
not
know
what
to
say
did
you
give
her
my
letter
did
she
say
where
she
was
going
then
he
understood
that
mildred
had
deceived
him
again
she
was
not
coming
back
to
him
he
made
an
effort
to
save
his
face
oh
well
i
daresay
i
shall
hear
from
her
she
may
have
sent
a
letter
to
another
address
he
turned
away
and
went
back
hopeless
to
his
rooms
he
might
have
known
that
she
would
do
this
she
had
never
cared
for
him
she
had
made
a
fool
of
him
from
the
beginning
she
had
no
pity
she
had
no
kindness
she
had
no
charity
the
only
thing
was
to
accept
the
inevitable
the
pain
he
was
suffering
was
horrible
he
would
sooner
be
dead
than
endure
it
and
the
thought
came
to
him
that
it
would
be
better
to
finish
with
the
whole
thing
he
might
throw
himself
in
the
river
or
put
his
neck
on
a
railway
line
but
he
had
no
sooner
set
the
thought
into
words
than
he
rebelled
against
it
his
reason
told
him
that
he
would
get
over
his
unhappiness
in
time
if
he
tried
with
all
his
might
he
could
forget
her
and
it
would
be
grotesque
to
kill
himself
on
account
of
a
vulgar
slut
he
had
only
one
life
and
it
was
madness
to
fling
it
away
he
felt
that
he
would
never
overcome
his
passion
but
he
knew
that
after
all
it
was
only
a
matter
of
time
he
would
not
stay
in
london
there
everything
reminded
him
of
his
unhappiness
he
telegraphed
to
his
uncle
that
he
was
coming
to
blackstable
and
hurrying
to
pack
took
the
first
train
he
could
he
wanted
to
get
away
from
the
sordid
rooms
in
which
he
had
endured
so
much
suffering
he
wanted
to
breathe
clean
air
he
was
disgusted
with
himself
he
felt
that
he
was
a
little
mad
since
he
was
grown
up
philip
had
been
given
the
best
spare
room
at
the
vicarage
it
was
a
cornerroom
and
in
front
of
one
window
was
an
old
tree
which
blocked
the
view
but
from
the
other
you
saw
beyond
the
garden
and
the
vicarage
field
broad
meadows
philip
remembered
the
wallpaper
from
his
earliest
years
on
the
walls
were
quaint
water
colours
of
the
early
victorian
period
by
a
friend
of
the
vicars
youth
they
had
a
faded
charm
the
dressingtable
was
surrounded
by
stiff
muslin
there
was
an
old
tallboy
to
put
your
clothes
in
philip
gave
a
sigh
of
pleasure
he
had
never
realised
that
all
those
things
meant
anything
to
him
at
all
at
the
vicarage
life
went
on
as
it
had
always
done
no
piece
of
furniture
had
been
moved
from
one
place
to
another
the
vicar
ate
the
same
things
said
the
same
things
went
for
the
same
walk
every
day
he
had
grown
a
little
fatter
a
little
more
silent
a
little
more
narrow
he
had
become
accustomed
to
living
without
his
wife
and
missed
her
very
little
he
bickered
still
with
josiah
graves
philip
went
to
see
the
churchwarden
he
was
a
little
thinner
a
little
whiter
a
little
more
austere
he
was
autocratic
still
and
still
disapproved
of
candles
on
the
altar
the
shops
had
still
a
pleasant
quaintness
and
philip
stood
in
front
of
that
in
which
things
useful
to
seamen
were
sold
seaboots
and
tarpaulins
and
tackle
and
remembered
that
he
had
felt
there
in
his
childhood
the
thrill
of
the
sea
and
the
adventurous
magic
of
the
unknown
he
could
not
help
his
heart
beating
at
each
double
knock
of
the
postman
in
case
there
might
be
a
letter
from
mildred
sent
on
by
his
landlady
in
london
but
he
knew
that
there
would
be
none
now
that
he
could
think
it
out
more
calmly
he
understood
that
in
trying
to
force
mildred
to
love
him
he
had
been
attempting
the
impossible
he
did
not
know
what
it
was
that
passed
from
a
man
to
a
woman
from
a
woman
to
a
man
and
made
one
of
them
a
slave
it
was
convenient
to
call
it
the
sexual
instinct
but
if
it
was
no
more
than
that
he
did
not
understand
why
it
should
occasion
so
vehement
an
attraction
to
one
person
rather
than
another
it
was
irresistible
the
mind
could
not
battle
with
it
friendship
gratitude
interest
had
no
power
beside
it
because
he
had
not
attracted
mildred
sexually
nothing
that
he
did
had
any
effect
upon
her
the
idea
revolted
him
it
made
human
nature
beastly
and
he
felt
suddenly
that
the
hearts
of
men
were
full
of
dark
places
because
mildred
was
indifferent
to
him
he
had
thought
her
sexless
her
anaemic
appearance
and
thin
lips
the
body
with
its
narrow
hips
and
flat
chest
the
languor
of
her
manner
carried
out
his
supposition
and
yet
she
was
capable
of
sudden
passions
which
made
her
willing
to
risk
everything
to
gratify
them
he
had
never
understood
her
adventure
with
emil
miller
it
had
seemed
so
unlike
her
and
she
had
never
been
able
to
explain
it
but
now
that
he
had
seen
her
with
griffiths
he
knew
that
just
the
same
thing
had
happened
then
she
had
been
carried
off
her
feet
by
an
ungovernable
desire
he
tried
to
think
out
what
those
two
men
had
which
so
strangely
attracted
her
they
both
had
a
vulgar
facetiousness
which
tickled
her
simple
sense
of
humour
and
a
certain
coarseness
of
nature
but
what
took
her
perhaps
was
the
blatant
sexuality
which
was
their
most
marked
characteristic
she
had
a
genteel
refinement
which
shuddered
at
the
facts
of
life
she
looked
upon
the
bodily
functions
as
indecent
she
had
all
sorts
of
euphemisms
for
common
objects
she
always
chose
an
elaborate
word
as
more
becoming
than
a
simple
one
the
brutality
of
these
men
was
like
a
whip
on
her
thin
white
shoulders
and
she
shuddered
with
voluptuous
pain
one
thing
philip
had
made
up
his
mind
about
he
would
not
go
back
to
the
lodgings
in
which
he
had
suffered
he
wrote
to
his
landlady
and
gave
her
notice
he
wanted
to
have
his
own
things
about
him
he
determined
to
take
unfurnished
rooms
it
would
be
pleasant
and
cheaper
and
this
was
an
urgent
consideration
for
during
the
last
year
and
a
half
he
had
spent
nearly
seven
hundred
pounds
he
must
make
up
for
it
now
by
the
most
rigid
economy
now
and
then
he
thought
of
the
future
with
panic
he
had
been
a
fool
to
spend
so
much
money
on
mildred
but
he
knew
that
if
it
were
to
come
again
he
would
act
in
the
same
way
it
amused
him
sometimes
to
consider
that
his
friends
because
he
had
a
face
which
did
not
express
his
feelings
very
vividly
and
a
rather
slow
way
of
moving
looked
upon
him
as
strongminded
deliberate
and
cool
they
thought
him
reasonable
and
praised
his
common
sense
but
he
knew
that
his
placid
expression
was
no
more
than
a
mask
assumed
unconsciously
which
acted
like
the
protective
colouring
of
butterflies
and
himself
was
astonished
at
the
weakness
of
his
will
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
swayed
by
every
light
emotion
as
though
he
were
a
leaf
in
the
wind
and
when
passion
seized
him
he
was
powerless
he
had
no
selfcontrol
he
merely
seemed
to
possess
it
because
he
was
indifferent
to
many
of
the
things
which
moved
other
people
he
considered
with
some
irony
the
philosophy
which
he
had
developed
for
himself
for
it
had
not
been
of
much
use
to
him
in
the
conjuncture
he
had
passed
through
and
he
wondered
whether
thought
really
helped
a
man
in
any
of
the
critical
affairs
of
life
it
seemed
to
him
rather
that
he
was
swayed
by
some
power
alien
to
and
yet
within
himself
which
urged
him
like
that
great
wind
of
hell
which
drove
paolo
and
francesca
ceaselessly
on
he
thought
of
what
he
was
going
to
do
and
when
the
time
came
to
act
he
was
powerless
in
the
grasp
of
instincts
emotions
he
knew
not
what
he
acted
as
though
he
were
a
machine
driven
by
the
two
forces
of
his
environment
and
his
personality
his
reason
was
someone
looking
on
observing
the
facts
but
powerless
to
interfere
it
was
like
those
gods
of
epicurus
who
saw
the
doings
of
men
from
their
empyrean
heights
and
had
no
might
to
alter
one
smallest
particle
of
what
occurred
chapter
lxxix
philip
went
up
to
london
a
couple
of
days
before
the
session
began
in
order
to
find
himself
rooms
he
hunted
about
the
streets
that
led
out
of
the
westminster
bridge
road
but
their
dinginess
was
distasteful
to
him
and
at
last
he
found
one
in
kennington
which
had
a
quiet
and
oldworld
air
it
reminded
one
a
little
of
the
london
which
thackeray
knew
on
that
side
of
the
river
and
in
the
kennington
road
through
which
the
great
barouche
of
the
newcomes
must
have
passed
as
it
drove
the
family
to
the
west
of
london
the
planetrees
were
bursting
into
leaf
the
houses
in
the
street
which
philip
fixed
upon
were
twostoried
and
in
most
of
the
windows
was
a
notice
to
state
that
lodgings
were
to
let
he
knocked
at
one
which
announced
that
the
lodgings
were
unfurnished
and
was
shown
by
an
austere
silent
woman
four
very
small
rooms
in
one
of
which
there
was
a
kitchen
range
and
a
sink
the
rent
was
nine
shillings
a
week
philip
did
not
want
so
many
rooms
but
the
rent
was
low
and
he
wished
to
settle
down
at
once
he
asked
the
landlady
if
she
could
keep
the
place
clean
for
him
and
cook
his
breakfast
but
she
replied
that
she
had
enough
work
to
do
without
that
and
he
was
pleased
rather
than
otherwise
because
she
intimated
that
she
wished
to
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
him
than
to
receive
his
rent
she
told
him
that
if
he
inquired
at
the
grocers
round
the
corner
which
was
also
a
post
office
he
might
hear
of
a
woman
who
would
do
for
him
philip
had
a
little
furniture
which
he
had
gathered
as
he
went
along
an
armchair
that
he
had
bought
in
paris
and
a
table
a
few
drawings
and
the
small
persian
rug
which
cronshaw
had
given
him
his
uncle
had
offered
a
foldup
bed
for
which
now
that
he
no
longer
let
his
house
in
august
he
had
no
further
use
and
by
spending
another
ten
pounds
philip
bought
himself
whatever
else
was
essential
he
spent
ten
shillings
on
putting
a
corncoloured
paper
in
the
room
he
was
making
his
parlour
and
he
hung
on
the
walls
a
sketch
which
lawson
had
given
him
of
the
quai
des
grands
augustins
and
the
photograph
of
the
odalisque
by
ingres
and
manets
olympia
which
in
paris
had
been
the
objects
of
his
contemplation
while
he
shaved
to
remind
himself
that
he
too
had
once
been
engaged
in
the
practice
of
art
he
put
up
a
charcoal
drawing
of
the
young
spaniard
miguel
ajuria
it
was
the
best
thing
he
had
ever
done
a
nude
standing
with
clenched
hands
his
feet
gripping
the
floor
with
a
peculiar
force
and
on
his
face
that
air
of
determination
which
had
been
so
impressive
and
though
philip
after
the
long
interval
saw
very
well
the
defects
of
his
work
its
associations
made
him
look
upon
it
with
tolerance
he
wondered
what
had
happened
to
miguel
there
is
nothing
so
terrible
as
the
pursuit
of
art
by
those
who
have
no
talent
perhaps
worn
out
by
exposure
starvation
disease
he
had
found
an
end
in
some
hospital
or
in
an
access
of
despair
had
sought
death
in
the
turbid
seine
but
perhaps
with
his
southern
instability
he
had
given
up
the
struggle
of
his
own
accord
and
now
a
clerk
in
some
office
in
madrid
turned
his
fervent
rhetoric
to
politics
and
bullfighting
philip
asked
lawson
and
hayward
to
come
and
see
his
new
rooms
and
they
came
one
with
a
bottle
of
whiskey
the
other
with
a
pate
de
foie
gras
and
he
was
delighted
when
they
praised
his
taste
he
would
have
invited
the
scotch
stockbroker
too
but
he
had
only
three
chairs
and
thus
could
entertain
only
a
definite
number
of
guests
lawson
was
aware
that
through
him
philip
had
become
very
friendly
with
norah
nesbit
and
now
remarked
that
he
had
run
across
her
a
few
days
before
she
was
asking
how
you
were
philip
flushed
at
the
mention
of
her
name
he
could
not
get
himself
out
of
the
awkward
habit
of
reddening
when
he
was
embarrassed
and
lawson
looked
at
him
quizzically
lawson
who
now
spent
most
of
the
year
in
london
had
so
far
surrendered
to
his
environment
as
to
wear
his
hair
short
and
to
dress
himself
in
a
neat
serge
suit
and
a
bowler
hat
i
gather
that
all
is
over
between
you
he
said
ive
not
seen
her
for
months
she
was
looking
rather
nice
she
had
a
very
smart
hat
on
with
a
lot
of
white
ostrich
feathers
on
it
she
must
be
doing
pretty
well
philip
changed
the
conversation
but
he
kept
thinking
of
her
and
after
an
interval
when
the
three
of
them
were
talking
of
something
else
he
asked
suddenly
did
you
gather
that
norah
was
angry
with
me
not
a
bit
she
talked
very
nicely
of
you
ive
got
half
a
mind
to
go
and
see
her
she
wont
eat
you
philip
had
thought
of
norah
often
when
mildred
left
him
his
first
thought
was
of
her
and
he
told
himself
bitterly
that
she
would
never
have
treated
him
so
his
impulse
was
to
go
to
her
he
could
depend
on
her
pity
but
he
was
ashamed
she
had
been
good
to
him
always
and
he
had
treated
her
abominably
if
id
only
had
the
sense
to
stick
to
her
he
said
to
himself
afterwards
when
lawson
and
hayward
had
gone
and
he
was
smoking
a
last
pipe
before
going
to
bed
he
remembered
the
pleasant
hours
they
had
spent
together
in
the
cosy
sittingroom
in
vincent
square
their
visits
to
galleries
and
to
the
play
and
the
charming
evenings
of
intimate
conversation
he
recollected
her
solicitude
for
his
welfare
and
her
interest
in
all
that
concerned
him
she
had
loved
him
with
a
love
that
was
kind
and
lasting
there
was
more
than
sensuality
in
it
it
was
almost
maternal
he
had
always
known
that
it
was
a
precious
thing
for
which
with
all
his
soul
he
should
thank
the
gods
he
made
up
his
mind
to
throw
himself
on
her
mercy
she
must
have
suffered
horribly
but
he
felt
she
had
the
greatness
of
heart
to
forgive
him
she
was
incapable
of
malice
should
he
write
to
her
no
he
would
break
in
on
her
suddenly
and
cast
himself
at
her
feethe
knew
that
when
the
time
came
he
would
feel
too
shy
to
perform
such
a
dramatic
gesture
but
that
was
how
he
liked
to
think
of
itand
tell
her
that
if
she
would
take
him
back
she
might
rely
on
him
for
ever
he
was
cured
of
the
hateful
disuse
from
which
he
had
suffered
he
knew
her
worth
and
now
she
might
trust
him
his
imagination
leaped
forward
to
the
future
he
pictured
himself
rowing
with
her
on
the
river
on
sundays
he
would
take
her
to
greenwich
he
had
never
forgotten
that
delightful
excursion
with
hayward
and
the
beauty
of
the
port
of
london
remained
a
permanent
treasure
in
his
recollection
and
on
the
warm
summer
afternoons
they
would
sit
in
the
park
together
and
talk
he
laughed
to
himself
as
he
remembered
her
gay
chatter
which
poured
out
like
a
brook
bubbling
over
little
stones
amusing
flippant
and
full
of
character
the
agony
he
had
suffered
would
pass
from
his
mind
like
a
bad
dream
but
when
next
day
about
teatime
an
hour
at
which
he
was
pretty
certain
to
find
norah
at
home
he
knocked
at
her
door
his
courage
suddenly
failed
him
was
it
possible
for
her
to
forgive
him
it
would
be
abominable
of
him
to
force
himself
on
her
presence
the
door
was
opened
by
a
maid
new
since
he
had
been
in
the
habit
of
calling
every
day
and
he
inquired
if
mrs
nesbit
was
in
will
you
ask
her
if
she
could
see
mr
carey
he
said
ill
wait
here
the
maid
ran
upstairs
and
in
a
moment
clattered
down
again
will
you
step
up
please
sir
second
floor
front
i
know
said
philip
with
a
slight
smile
he
went
with
a
fluttering
heart
he
knocked
at
the
door
come
in
said
the
wellknown
cheerful
voice
it
seemed
to
say
come
in
to
a
new
life
of
peace
and
happiness
when
he
entered
norah
stepped
forward
to
greet
him
she
shook
hands
with
him
as
if
they
had
parted
the
day
before
a
man
stood
up
mr
careymr
kingsford
philip
bitterly
disappointed
at
not
finding
her
alone
sat
down
and
took
stock
of
the
stranger
he
had
never
heard
her
mention
his
name
but
he
seemed
to
philip
to
occupy
his
chair
as
though
he
were
very
much
at
home
he
was
a
man
of
forty
cleanshaven
with
long
fair
hair
very
neatly
plastered
down
and
the
reddish
skin
and
pale
tired
eyes
which
fair
men
get
when
their
youth
is
passed
he
had
a
large
nose
a
large
mouth
the
bones
of
his
face
were
prominent
and
he
was
heavily
made
he
was
a
man
of
more
than
average
height
and
broadshouldered
i
was
wondering
what
had
become
of
you
said
norah
in
her
sprightly
manner
i
met
mr
lawson
the
other
daydid
he
tell
youand
i
informed
him
that
it
was
really
high
time
you
came
to
see
me
again
philip
could
see
no
shadow
of
embarrassment
in
her
countenance
and
he
admired
the
use
with
which
she
carried
off
an
encounter
of
which
himself
felt
the
intense
awkwardness
she
gave
him
tea
she
was
about
to
put
sugar
in
it
when
he
stopped
her
how
stupid
of
me
she
cried
i
forgot
he
did
not
believe
that
she
must
remember
quite
well
that
he
never
took
sugar
in
his
tea
he
accepted
the
incident
as
a
sign
that
her
nonchalance
was
affected
the
conversation
which
philip
had
interrupted
went
on
and
presently
he
began
to
feel
a
little
in
the
way
kingsford
took
no
particular
notice
of
him
he
talked
fluently
and
well
not
without
humour
but
with
a
slightly
dogmatic
manner
he
was
a
journalist
it
appeared
and
had
something
amusing
to
say
on
every
topic
that
was
touched
upon
but
it
exasperated
philip
to
find
himself
edged
out
of
the
conversation
he
was
determined
to
stay
the
visitor
out
he
wondered
if
he
admired
norah
in
the
old
days
they
had
often
talked
of
the
men
who
wanted
to
flirt
with
her
and
had
laughed
at
them
together
philip
tried
to
bring
back
the
conversation
to
matters
which
only
he
and
norah
knew
about
but
each
time
the
journalist
broke
in
and
succeeded
in
drawing
it
away
to
a
subject
upon
which
philip
was
forced
to
be
silent
he
grew
faintly
angry
with
norah
for
she
must
see
he
was
being
made
ridiculous
but
perhaps
she
was
inflicting
this
upon
him
as
a
punishment
and
with
this
thought
he
regained
his
good
humour
at
last
however
the
clock
struck
six
and
kingsford
got
up
i
must
go
he
said
norah
shook
hands
with
him
and
accompanied
him
to
the
landing
she
shut
the
door
behind
her
and
stood
outside
for
a
couple
of
minutes
philip
wondered
what
they
were
talking
about
who
is
mr
kingsford
he
asked
cheerfully
when
she
returned
oh
hes
the
editor
of
one
of
harmsworths
magazines
hes
been
taking
a
good
deal
of
my
work
lately
i
thought
he
was
never
going
im
glad
you
stayed
i
wanted
to
have
a
talk
with
you
she
curled
herself
into
the
large
armchair
feet
and
all
in
a
way
her
small
size
made
possible
and
lit
a
cigarette
he
smiled
when
he
saw
her
assume
the
attitude
which
had
always
amused
him
you
look
just
like
a
cat
she
gave
him
a
flash
of
her
dark
fine
eyes
i
really
ought
to
break
myself
of
the
habit
its
absurd
to
behave
like
a
child
when
youre
my
age
but
im
comfortable
with
my
legs
under
me
its
awfully
jolly
to
be
sitting
in
this
room
again
said
philip
happily
you
dont
know
how
ive
missed
it
why
on
earth
didnt
you
come
before
she
asked
gaily
i
was
afraid
to
he
said
reddening
she
gave
him
a
look
full
of
kindness
her
lips
outlined
a
charming
smile
you
neednt
have
been
he
hesitated
for
a
moment
his
heart
beat
quickly
dyou
remember
the
last
time
we
met
i
treated
you
awfully
badlyim
dreadfully
ashamed
of
myself
she
looked
at
him
steadily
she
did
not
answer
he
was
losing
his
head
he
seemed
to
have
come
on
an
errand
of
which
he
was
only
now
realising
the
outrageousness
she
did
not
help
him
and
he
could
only
blurt
out
bluntly
can
you
ever
forgive
me
then
impetuously
he
told
her
that
mildred
had
left
him
and
that
his
unhappiness
had
been
so
great
that
he
almost
killed
himself
he
told
her
of
all
that
had
happened
between
them
of
the
birth
of
the
child
and
of
the
meeting
with
griffiths
of
his
folly
and
his
trust
and
his
immense
deception
he
told
her
how
often
he
had
thought
of
her
kindness
and
of
her
love
and
how
bitterly
he
had
regretted
throwing
it
away
he
had
only
been
happy
when
he
was
with
her
and
he
knew
now
how
great
was
her
worth
his
voice
was
hoarse
with
emotion
sometimes
he
was
so
ashamed
of
what
he
was
saying
that
he
spoke
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground
his
face
was
distorted
with
pain
and
yet
he
felt
it
a
strange
relief
to
speak
at
last
he
finished
he
flung
himself
back
in
his
chair
exhausted
and
waited
he
had
concealed
nothing
and
even
in
his
selfabasement
he
had
striven
to
make
himself
more
despicable
than
he
had
really
been
he
was
surprised
that
she
did
not
speak
and
at
last
he
raised
his
eyes
she
was
not
looking
at
him
her
face
was
quite
white
and
she
seemed
to
be
lost
in
thought
havent
you
got
anything
to
say
to
me
she
started
and
reddened
im
afraid
youve
had
a
rotten
time
she
said
im
dreadfully
sorry
she
seemed
about
to
go
on
but
she
stopped
and
again
he
waited
at
length
she
seemed
to
force
herself
to
speak
im
engaged
to
be
married
to
mr
kingsford
why
didnt
you
tell
me
at
once
he
cried
you
neednt
have
allowed
me
to
humiliate
myself
before
you
im
sorry
i
couldnt
stop
you
i
met
him
soon
after
youshe
seemed
to
search
for
an
expression
that
should
not
wound
himtold
me
your
friend
had
come
back
i
was
very
wretched
for
a
bit
he
was
extremely
kind
to
me
he
knew
someone
had
made
me
suffer
of
course
he
doesnt
know
it
was
you
and
i
dont
know
what
i
should
have
done
without
him
and
suddenly
i
felt
i
couldnt
go
on
working
working
working
i
was
so
tired
i
felt
so
ill
i
told
him
about
my
husband
he
offered
to
give
me
the
money
to
get
my
divorce
if
i
would
marry
him
as
soon
as
i
could
he
had
a
very
good
job
and
it
wouldnt
be
necessary
for
me
to
do
anything
unless
i
wanted
to
he
was
so
fond
of
me
and
so
anxious
to
take
care
of
me
i
was
awfully
touched
and
now
im
very
very
fond
of
him
have
you
got
your
divorce
then
asked
philip
ive
got
the
decree
nisi
itll
be
made
absolute
in
july
and
then
we
are
going
to
be
married
at
once
for
some
time
philip
did
not
say
anything
i
wish
i
hadnt
made
such
a
fool
of
myself
he
muttered
at
length
he
was
thinking
of
his
long
humiliating
confession
she
looked
at
him
curiously
you
were
never
really
in
love
with
me
she
said
its
not
very
pleasant
being
in
love
but
he
was
always
able
to
recover
himself
quickly
and
getting
up
now
and
holding
out
his
hand
he
said
i
hope
youll
be
very
happy
after
all
its
the
best
thing
that
could
have
happened
to
you
she
looked
a
little
wistfully
at
him
as
she
took
his
hand
and
held
it
youll
come
and
see
me
again
wont
you
she
asked
no
he
said
shaking
his
head
it
would
make
me
too
envious
to
see
you
happy
he
walked
slowly
away
from
her
house
after
all
she
was
right
when
she
said
he
had
never
loved
her
he
was
disappointed
irritated
even
but
his
vanity
was
more
affected
than
his
heart
he
knew
that
himself
and
presently
he
grew
conscious
that
the
gods
had
played
a
very
good
practical
joke
on
him
and
he
laughed
at
himself
mirthlessly
it
is
not
very
comfortable
to
have
the
gift
of
being
amused
at
ones
own
absurdity
chapter
lxxx
for
the
next
three
months
philip
worked
on
subjects
which
were
new
to
him
the
unwieldy
crowd
which
had
entered
the
medical
school
nearly
two
years
before
had
thinned
out
some
had
left
the
hospital
finding
the
examinations
more
difficult
to
pass
than
they
expected
some
had
been
taken
away
by
parents
who
had
not
foreseen
the
expense
of
life
in
london
and
some
had
drifted
away
to
other
callings
one
youth
whom
philip
knew
had
devised
an
ingenious
plan
to
make
money
he
had
bought
things
at
sales
and
pawned
them
but
presently
found
it
more
profitable
to
pawn
goods
bought
on
credit
and
it
had
caused
a
little
excitement
at
the
hospital
when
someone
pointed
out
his
name
in
policecourt
proceedings
there
had
been
a
remand
then
assurances
on
the
part
of
a
harassed
father
and
the
young
man
had
gone
out
to
bear
the
white
mans
burden
overseas
the
imagination
of
another
a
lad
who
had
never
before
been
in
a
town
at
all
fell
to
the
glamour
of
musichalls
and
bar
parlours
he
spent
his
time
among
racingmen
tipsters
and
trainers
and
now
was
become
a
bookmakers
clerk
philip
had
seen
him
once
in
a
bar
near
piccadilly
circus
in
a
tightwaisted
coat
and
a
brown
hat
with
a
broad
flat
brim
a
third
with
a
gift
for
singing
and
mimicry
who
had
achieved
success
at
the
smoking
concerts
of
the
medical
school
by
his
imitation
of
notorious
comedians
had
abandoned
the
hospital
for
the
chorus
of
a
musical
comedy
still
another
and
he
interested
philip
because
his
uncouth
manner
and
interjectional
speech
did
not
suggest
that
he
was
capable
of
any
deep
emotion
had
felt
himself
stifle
among
the
houses
of
london
he
grew
haggard
in
shutin
spaces
and
the
soul
he
knew
not
he
possessed
struggled
like
a
sparrow
held
in
the
hand
with
little
frightened
gasps
and
a
quick
palpitation
of
the
heart
he
yearned
for
the
broad
skies
and
the
open
desolate
places
among
which
his
childhood
had
been
spent
and
he
walked
off
one
day
without
a
word
to
anybody
between
one
lecture
and
another
and
the
next
thing
his
friends
heard
was
that
he
had
thrown
up
medicine
and
was
working
on
a
farm
philip
attended
now
lectures
on
medicine
and
on
surgery
on
certain
mornings
in
the
week
he
practised
bandaging
on
outpatients
glad
to
earn
a
little
money
and
he
was
taught
auscultation
and
how
to
use
the
stethoscope
he
learned
dispensing
he
was
taking
the
examination
in
materia
medica
in
july
and
it
amused
him
to
play
with
various
drugs
concocting
mixtures
rolling
pills
and
making
ointments
he
seized
avidly
upon
anything
from
which
he
could
extract
a
suggestion
of
human
interest
he
saw
griffiths
once
in
the
distance
but
not
to
have
the
pain
of
cutting
him
dead
avoided
him
philip
had
felt
a
certain
selfconsciousness
with
griffiths
friends
some
of
whom
were
now
friends
of
his
when
he
realised
they
knew
of
his
quarrel
with
griffiths
and
surmised
they
were
aware
of
the
reason
one
of
them
a
very
tall
fellow
with
a
small
head
and
a
languid
air
a
youth
called
ramsden
who
was
one
of
griffiths
most
faithful
admirers
copied
his
ties
his
boots
his
manner
of
talking
and
his
gestures
told
philip
that
griffiths
was
very
much
hurt
because
philip
had
not
answered
his
letter
he
wanted
to
be
reconciled
with
him
has
he
asked
you
to
give
me
the
message
asked
philip
oh
no
im
saying
this
entirely
on
my
own
said
ramsden
hes
awfully
sorry
for
what
he
did
and
he
says
you
always
behaved
like
a
perfect
brick
to
him
i
know
hed
be
glad
to
make
it
up
he
doesnt
come
to
the
hospital
because
hes
afraid
of
meeting
you
and
he
thinks
youd
cut
him
i
should
it
makes
him
feel
rather
wretched
you
know
i
can
bear
the
trifling
inconvenience
that
he
feels
with
a
good
deal
of
fortitude
said
philip
hell
do
anything
he
can
to
make
it
up
how
childish
and
hysterical
why
should
he
care
im
a
very
insignificant
person
and
he
can
do
very
well
without
my
company
im
not
interested
in
him
any
more
ramsden
thought
philip
hard
and
cold
he
paused
for
a
moment
or
two
looking
about
him
in
a
perplexed
way
harry
wishes
to
god
hed
never
had
anything
to
do
with
the
woman
does
he
asked
philip
he
spoke
with
an
indifference
which
he
was
satisfied
with
no
one
could
have
guessed
how
violently
his
heart
was
beating
he
waited
impatiently
for
ramsden
to
go
on
i
suppose
youve
quite
got
over
it
now
havent
you
i
said
philip
quite
little
by
little
he
discovered
the
history
of
mildreds
relations
with
griffiths
he
listened
with
a
smile
on
his
lips
feigning
an
equanimity
which
quite
deceived
the
dullwitted
boy
who
talked
to
him
the
weekend
she
spent
with
griffiths
at
oxford
inflamed
rather
than
extinguished
her
sudden
passion
and
when
griffiths
went
home
with
a
feeling
that
was
unexpected
in
her
she
determined
to
stay
in
oxford
by
herself
for
a
couple
of
days
because
she
had
been
so
happy
in
it
she
felt
that
nothing
could
induce
her
to
go
back
to
philip
he
revolted
her
griffiths
was
taken
aback
at
the
fire
he
had
aroused
for
he
had
found
his
two
days
with
her
in
the
country
somewhat
tedious
and
he
had
no
desire
to
turn
an
amusing
episode
into
a
tiresome
affair
she
made
him
promise
to
write
to
her
and
being
an
honest
decent
fellow
with
natural
politeness
and
a
desire
to
make
himself
pleasant
to
everybody
when
he
got
home
he
wrote
her
a
long
and
charming
letter
she
answered
it
with
reams
of
passion
clumsy
for
she
had
no
gift
of
expression
illwritten
and
vulgar
the
letter
bored
him
and
when
it
was
followed
next
day
by
another
and
the
day
after
by
a
third
he
began
to
think
her
love
no
longer
flattering
but
alarming
he
did
not
answer
and
she
bombarded
him
with
telegrams
asking
him
if
he
were
ill
and
had
received
her
letters
she
said
his
silence
made
her
dreadfully
anxious
he
was
forced
to
write
but
he
sought
to
make
his
reply
as
casual
as
was
possible
without
being
offensive
he
begged
her
not
to
wire
since
it
was
difficult
to
explain
telegrams
to
his
mother
an
oldfashioned
person
for
whom
a
telegram
was
still
an
event
to
excite
tremor
she
answered
by
return
of
post
that
she
must
see
him
and
announced
her
intention
to
pawn
things
she
had
the
dressingcase
which
philip
had
given
her
as
a
weddingpresent
and
could
raise
eight
pounds
on
that
in
order
to
come
up
and
stay
at
the
market
town
four
miles
from
which
was
the
village
in
which
his
father
practised
this
frightened
griffiths
and
he
this
time
made
use
of
the
telegraph
wires
to
tell
her
that
she
must
do
nothing
of
the
kind
he
promised
to
let
her
know
the
moment
he
came
up
to
london
and
when
he
did
found
that
she
had
already
been
asking
for
him
at
the
hospital
at
which
he
had
an
appointment
he
did
not
like
this
and
on
seeing
her
told
mildred
that
she
was
not
to
come
there
on
any
pretext
and
now
after
an
absence
of
three
weeks
he
found
that
she
bored
him
quite
decidedly
he
wondered
why
he
had
ever
troubled
about
her
and
made
up
his
mind
to
break
with
her
as
soon
as
he
could
he
was
a
person
who
dreaded
quarrels
nor
did
he
want
to
give
pain
but
at
the
same
time
he
had
other
things
to
do
and
he
was
quite
determined
not
to
let
mildred
bother
him
when
he
met
her
he
was
pleasant
cheerful
amusing
affectionate
he
invented
convincing
excuses
for
the
interval
since
last
he
had
seen
her
but
he
did
everything
he
could
to
avoid
her
when
she
forced
him
to
make
appointments
he
sent
telegrams
to
her
at
the
last
moment
to
put
himself
off
and
his
landlady
the
first
three
months
of
his
appointment
he
was
spending
in
rooms
had
orders
to
say
he
was
out
when
mildred
called
she
would
waylay
him
in
the
street
and
knowing
she
had
been
waiting
about
for
him
to
come
out
of
the
hospital
for
a
couple
of
hours
he
would
give
her
a
few
charming
friendly
words
and
bolt
off
with
the
excuse
that
he
had
a
business
engagement
he
grew
very
skilful
in
slipping
out
of
the
hospital
unseen
once
when
he
went
back
to
his
lodgings
at
midnight
he
saw
a
woman
standing
at
the
area
railings
and
suspecting
who
it
was
went
to
beg
a
shakedown
in
ramsdens
rooms
next
day
the
landlady
told
him
that
mildred
had
sat
crying
on
the
doorsteps
for
hours
and
she
had
been
obliged
to
tell
her
at
last
that
if
she
did
not
go
away
she
would
send
for
a
policeman
i
tell
you
my
boy
said
ramsden
youre
jolly
well
out
of
it
harry
says
that
if
hed
suspected
for
half
a
second
she
was
going
to
make
such
a
blooming
nuisance
of
herself
hed
have
seen
himself
damned
before
he
had
anything
to
do
with
her
philip
thought
of
her
sitting
on
that
doorstep
through
the
long
hours
of
the
night
he
saw
her
face
as
she
looked
up
dully
at
the
landlady
who
sent
her
away
i
wonder
what
shes
doing
now
oh
shes
got
a
job
somewhere
thank
god
that
keeps
her
busy
all
day
the
last
thing
he
heard
just
before
the
end
of
the
summer
session
was
that
griffiths
urbanity
had
given
way
at
length
under
the
exasperation
of
the
constant
persecution
he
had
told
mildred
that
he
was
sick
of
being
pestered
and
she
had
better
take
herself
off
and
not
bother
him
again
it
was
the
only
thing
he
could
do
said
ramsden
it
was
getting
a
bit
too
thick
is
it
all
over
then
asked
philip
oh
he
hasnt
seen
her
for
ten
days
you
know
harrys
wonderful
at
dropping
people
this
is
about
the
toughest
nut
hes
ever
had
to
crack
but
hes
cracked
it
all
right
then
philip
heard
nothing
more
of
her
at
all
she
vanished
into
the
vast
anonymous
mass
of
the
population
of
london
chapter
lxxxi
at
the
beginning
of
the
winter
session
philip
became
an
outpatients
clerk
there
were
three
assistantphysicians
who
took
outpatients
two
days
a
week
each
and
philip
put
his
name
down
for
dr
tyrell
he
was
popular
with
the
students
and
there
was
some
competition
to
be
his
clerk
dr
tyrell
was
a
tall
thin
man
of
thirtyfive
with
a
very
small
head
red
hair
cut
short
and
prominent
blue
eyes
his
face
was
bright
scarlet
he
talked
well
in
a
pleasant
voice
was
fond
of
a
little
joke
and
treated
the
world
lightly
he
was
a
successful
man
with
a
large
consulting
practice
and
a
knighthood
in
prospect
from
commerce
with
students
and
poor
people
he
had
the
patronising
air
and
from
dealing
always
with
the
sick
he
had
the
healthy
mans
jovial
condescension
which
some
consultants
achieve
as
the
professional
manner
he
made
the
patient
feel
like
a
boy
confronted
by
a
jolly
schoolmaster
his
illness
was
an
absurd
piece
of
naughtiness
which
amused
rather
than
irritated
the
student
was
supposed
to
attend
in
the
outpatients
room
every
day
see
cases
and
pick
up
what
information
he
could
but
on
the
days
on
which
he
clerked
his
duties
were
a
little
more
definite
at
that
time
the
outpatients
department
at
st
lukes
consisted
of
three
rooms
leading
into
one
another
and
a
large
dark
waitingroom
with
massive
pillars
of
masonry
and
long
benches
here
the
patients
waited
after
having
been
given
their
letters
at
midday
and
the
long
rows
of
them
bottles
and
gallipots
in
hand
some
tattered
and
dirty
others
decent
enough
sitting
in
the
dimness
men
and
women
of
all
ages
children
gave
one
an
impression
which
was
weird
and
horrible
they
suggested
the
grim
drawings
of
daumier
all
the
rooms
were
painted
alike
in
salmoncolour
with
a
high
dado
of
maroon
and
there
was
in
them
an
odour
of
disinfectants
mingling
as
the
afternoon
wore
on
with
the
crude
stench
of
humanity
the
first
room
was
the
largest
and
in
the
middle
of
it
were
a
table
and
an
office
chair
for
the
physician
on
each
side
of
this
were
two
smaller
tables
a
little
lower
at
one
of
these
sat
the
housephysician
and
at
the
other
the
clerk
who
took
the
book
for
the
day
this
was
a
large
volume
in
which
were
written
down
the
name
age
sex
profession
of
the
patient
and
the
diagnosis
of
his
disuse
at
half
past
one
the
housephysician
came
in
rang
the
bell
and
told
the
porter
to
send
in
the
old
patients
there
were
always
a
good
many
of
these
and
it
was
necessary
to
get
through
as
many
of
them
as
possible
before
dr
tyrell
came
at
two
the
hp
with
whom
philip
came
in
contact
was
a
dapper
little
man
excessively
conscious
of
his
importance
he
treated
the
clerks
with
condescension
and
patently
resented
the
familiarity
of
older
students
who
had
been
his
contemporaries
and
did
not
use
him
with
the
respect
he
felt
his
present
position
demanded
he
set
about
the
cases
a
clerk
helped
him
the
patients
streamed
in
the
men
came
first
chronic
bronchitis
a
nasty
acking
cough
was
what
they
chiefly
suffered
from
one
went
to
the
hp
and
the
other
to
the
clerk
handing
in
their
letters
if
they
were
going
on
well
the
words
rep

were
written
on
them
and
they
went
to
the
dispensary
with
their
bottles
or
gallipots
in
order
to
have
medicine
given
them
for
fourteen
days
more
some
old
stagers
held
back
so
that
they
might
be
seen
by
the
physician
himself
but
they
seldom
succeeded
in
this
and
only
three
or
four
whose
condition
seemed
to
demand
his
attention
were
kept
dr
tyrell
came
in
with
quick
movements
and
a
breezy
manner
he
reminded
one
slightly
of
a
clown
leaping
into
the
arena
of
a
circus
with
the
cry
here
we
are
again
his
air
seemed
to
indicate
whats
all
this
nonsense
about
being
ill
ill
soon
put
that
right
he
took
his
seat
asked
if
there
were
any
old
patients
for
him
to
see
rapidly
passed
them
in
review
looking
at
them
with
shrewd
eyes
as
he
discussed
their
symptoms
cracked
a
joke
at
which
all
the
clerks
laughed
heartily
with
the
hp
who
laughed
heartily
too
but
with
an
air
as
if
he
thought
it
was
rather
impudent
for
the
clerks
to
laugh
remarked
that
it
was
a
fine
day
or
a
hot
one
and
rang
the
bell
for
the
porter
to
show
in
the
new
patients
they
came
in
one
by
one
and
walked
up
to
the
table
at
which
sat
dr
tyrell
they
were
old
men
and
young
men
and
middleaged
men
mostly
of
the
labouring
class
dock
labourers
draymen
factory
hands
barmen
but
some
neatly
dressed
were
of
a
station
which
was
obviously
superior
shopassistants
clerks
and
the
like
dr
tyrell
looked
at
these
with
suspicion
sometimes
they
put
on
shabby
clothes
in
order
to
pretend
they
were
poor
but
he
had
a
keen
eye
to
prevent
what
he
regarded
as
fraud
and
sometimes
refused
to
see
people
who
he
thought
could
well
pay
for
medical
attendance
women
were
the
worst
offenders
and
they
managed
the
thing
more
clumsily
they
would
wear
a
cloak
and
a
skirt
which
were
almost
in
rags
and
neglect
to
take
the
rings
off
their
fingers
if
you
can
afford
to
wear
jewellery
you
can
afford
a
doctor
a
hospital
is
a
charitable
institution
said
dr
tyrell
he
handed
back
the
letter
and
called
for
the
next
case
but
ive
got
my
letter
i
dont
care
a
hang
about
your
letter
you
get
out
youve
got
no
business
to
come
and
steal
the
time
which
is
wanted
by
the
really
poor
the
patient
retired
sulkily
with
an
angry
scowl
shell
probably
write
a
letter
to
the
papers
on
the
gross
mismanagement
of
the
london
hospitals
said
dr
tyrell
with
a
smile
as
he
took
the
next
paper
and
gave
the
patient
one
of
his
shrewd
glances
most
of
them
were
under
the
impression
that
the
hospital
was
an
institution
of
the
state
for
which
they
paid
out
of
the
rates
and
took
the
attendance
they
received
as
a
right
they
could
claim
they
imagined
the
physician
who
gave
them
his
time
was
heavily
paid
dr
tyrell
gave
each
of
his
clerks
a
case
to
examine
the
clerk
took
the
patient
into
one
of
the
inner
rooms
they
were
smaller
and
each
had
a
couch
in
it
covered
with
black
horsehair
he
asked
his
patient
a
variety
of
questions
examined
his
lungs
his
heart
and
his
liver
made
notes
of
fact
on
the
hospital
letter
formed
in
his
own
mind
some
idea
of
the
diagnosis
and
then
waited
for
dr
tyrell
to
come
in
this
he
did
followed
by
a
small
crowd
of
students
when
he
had
finished
the
men
and
the
clerk
read
out
what
he
had
learned
the
physician
asked
him
one
or
two
questions
and
examined
the
patient
himself
if
there
was
anything
interesting
to
hear
students
applied
their
stethoscope
you
would
see
a
man
with
two
or
three
to
the
chest
and
two
perhaps
to
his
back
while
others
waited
impatiently
to
listen
the
patient
stood
among
them
a
little
embarrassed
but
not
altogether
displeased
to
find
himself
the
centre
of
attention
he
listened
confusedly
while
dr
tyrell
discoursed
glibly
on
the
case
two
or
three
students
listened
again
to
recognise
the
murmur
or
the
crepitation
which
the
physician
described
and
then
the
man
was
told
to
put
on
his
clothes
when
the
various
cases
had
been
examined
dr
tyrell
went
back
into
the
large
room
and
sat
down
again
at
his
desk
he
asked
any
student
who
happened
to
be
standing
near
him
what
he
would
prescribe
for
a
patient
he
had
just
seen
the
student
mentioned
one
or
two
drugs
would
you
said
dr
tyrell
well
thats
original
at
all
events
i
dont
think
well
be
rash
this
always
made
the
students
laugh
and
with
a
twinkle
of
amusement
at
his
own
bright
humour
the
physician
prescribed
some
other
drug
than
that
which
the
student
had
suggested
when
there
were
two
cases
of
exactly
the
same
sort
and
the
student
proposed
the
treatment
which
the
physician
had
ordered
for
the
first
dr
tyrell
exercised
considerable
ingenuity
in
thinking
of
something
else
sometimes
knowing
that
in
the
dispensary
they
were
worked
off
their
legs
and
preferred
to
give
the
medicines
which
they
had
all
ready
the
good
hospital
mixtures
which
had
been
found
by
the
experience
of
years
to
answer
their
purpose
so
well
he
amused
himself
by
writing
an
elaborate
prescription
well
give
the
dispenser
something
to
do
if
we
go
on
prescribing
mist
alb
hell
lose
his
cunning
the
students
laughed
and
the
doctor
gave
them
a
circular
glance
of
enjoyment
in
his
joke
then
he
touched
the
bell
and
when
the
porter
poked
his
head
in
said
old
women
please
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
chatting
with
the
hp
while
the
porter
herded
along
the
old
patients
they
came
in
strings
of
anaemic
girls
with
large
fringes
and
pallid
lips
who
could
not
digest
their
bad
insufficient
food
old
ladies
fat
and
thin
aged
prematurely
by
frequent
confinements
with
winter
coughs
women
with
this
that
and
the
other
the
matter
with
them
dr
tyrell
and
his
housephysician
got
through
them
quickly
time
was
getting
on
and
the
air
in
the
small
room
was
growing
more
sickly
the
physician
looked
at
his
watch
are
there
many
new
women
today
he
asked
a
good
few
i
think
said
the
hp
wed
better
have
them
in
you
can
go
on
with
the
old
ones
they
entered
with
the
men
the
most
common
ailments
were
due
to
the
excessive
use
of
alcohol
but
with
the
women
they
were
due
to
defective
nourishment
by
about
six
oclock
they
were
finished
philip
exhausted
by
standing
all
the
time
by
the
bad
air
and
by
the
attention
he
had
given
strolled
over
with
his
fellowclerks
to
the
medical
school
to
have
tea
he
found
the
work
of
absorbing
interest
there
was
humanity
there
in
the
rough
the
materials
the
artist
worked
on
and
philip
felt
a
curious
thrill
when
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
was
in
the
position
of
the
artist
and
the
patients
were
like
clay
in
his
hands
he
remembered
with
an
amused
shrug
of
the
shoulders
his
life
in
paris
absorbed
in
colour
tone
values
heaven
knows
what
with
the
aim
of
producing
beautiful
things
the
directness
of
contact
with
men
and
women
gave
a
thrill
of
power
which
he
had
never
known
he
found
an
endless
excitement
in
looking
at
their
faces
and
hearing
them
speak
they
came
in
each
with
his
peculiarity
some
shuffling
uncouthly
some
with
a
little
trip
others
with
heavy
slow
tread
some
shyly
often
you
could
guess
their
trades
by
the
look
of
them
you
learnt
in
what
way
to
put
your
questions
so
that
they
should
be
understood
you
discovered
on
what
subjects
nearly
all
lied
and
by
what
inquiries
you
could
extort
the
truth
notwithstanding
you
saw
the
different
way
people
took
the
same
things
the
diagnosis
of
dangerous
illness
would
be
accepted
by
one
with
a
laugh
and
a
joke
by
another
with
dumb
despair
philip
found
that
he
was
less
shy
with
these
people
than
he
had
ever
been
with
others
he
felt
not
exactly
sympathy
for
sympathy
suggests
condescension
but
he
felt
at
home
with
them
he
found
that
he
was
able
to
put
them
at
their
ease
and
when
he
had
been
given
a
case
to
find
out
what
he
could
about
it
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
patient
delivered
himself
into
his
hands
with
a
peculiar
confidence
perhaps
he
thought
to
himself
with
a
smile
perhaps
im
cut
out
to
be
a
doctor
it
would
be
rather
a
lark
if
id
hit
upon
the
one
thing
im
fit
for
it
seemed
to
philip
that
he
alone
of
the
clerks
saw
the
dramatic
interest
of
those
afternoons
to
the
others
men
and
women
were
only
cases
good
if
they
were
complicated
tiresome
if
obvious
they
heard
murmurs
and
were
astonished
at
abnormal
livers
an
unexpected
sound
in
the
lungs
gave
them
something
to
talk
about
but
to
philip
there
was
much
more
he
found
an
interest
in
just
looking
at
them
in
the
shape
of
their
heads
and
their
hands
in
the
look
of
their
eyes
and
the
length
of
their
noses
you
saw
in
that
room
human
nature
taken
by
surprise
and
often
the
mask
of
custom
was
torn
off
rudely
showing
you
the
soul
all
raw
sometimes
you
saw
an
untaught
stoicism
which
was
profoundly
moving
once
philip
saw
a
man
rough
and
illiterate
told
his
case
was
hopeless
and
selfcontrolled
himself
he
wondered
at
the
splendid
instinct
which
forced
the
fellow
to
keep
a
stiff
upperlip
before
strangers
but
was
it
possible
for
him
to
be
brave
when
he
was
by
himself
face
to
face
with
his
soul
or
would
he
then
surrender
to
despair
sometimes
there
was
tragedy
once
a
young
woman
brought
her
sister
to
be
examined
a
girl
of
eighteen
with
delicate
features
and
large
blue
eyes
fair
hair
that
sparkled
with
gold
when
a
ray
of
autumn
sunshine
touched
it
for
a
moment
and
a
skin
of
amazing
beauty
the
students
eyes
went
to
her
with
little
smiles
they
did
not
often
see
a
pretty
girl
in
these
dingy
rooms
the
elder
woman
gave
the
family
history
father
and
mother
had
died
of
phthisis
a
brother
and
a
sister
these
two
were
the
only
ones
left
the
girl
had
been
coughing
lately
and
losing
weight
she
took
off
her
blouse
and
the
skin
of
her
neck
was
like
milk
dr
tyrell
examined
her
quietly
with
his
usual
rapid
method
he
told
two
or
three
of
his
clerks
to
apply
their
stethoscopes
to
a
place
he
indicated
with
his
finger
and
then
she
was
allowed
to
dress
the
sister
was
standing
a
little
apart
and
she
spoke
to
him
in
a
low
voice
so
that
the
girl
should
not
hear
her
voice
trembled
with
fear
she
hasnt
got
it
doctor
has
she
im
afraid
theres
no
doubt
about
it
she
was
the
last
one
when
she
goes
i
shant
have
anybody
she
began
to
cry
while
the
doctor
looked
at
her
gravely
he
thought
she
too
had
the
type
she
would
not
make
old
bones
either
the
girl
turned
round
and
saw
her
sisters
tears
she
understood
what
they
meant
the
colour
fled
from
her
lovely
face
and
tears
fell
down
her
cheeks
the
two
stood
for
a
minute
or
two
crying
silently
and
then
the
older
forgetting
the
indifferent
crowd
that
watched
them
went
up
to
her
took
her
in
her
arms
and
rocked
her
gently
to
and
fro
as
if
she
were
a
baby
when
they
were
gone
a
student
asked
how
long
dyou
think
shell
last
sir
dr
tyrell
shrugged
his
shoulders
her
brother
and
sister
died
within
three
months
of
the
first
symptoms
shell
do
the
same
if
they
were
rich
one
might
do
something
you
cant
tell
these
people
to
go
to
st
moritz
nothing
can
be
done
for
them
once
a
man
who
was
strong
and
in
all
the
power
of
his
manhood
came
because
a
persistent
aching
troubled
him
and
his
clubdoctor
did
not
seem
to
do
him
any
good
and
the
verdict
for
him
too
was
death
not
the
inevitable
death
that
horrified
and
yet
was
tolerable
because
science
was
helpless
before
it
but
the
death
which
was
inevitable
because
the
man
was
a
little
wheel
in
the
great
machine
of
a
complex
civilisation
and
had
as
little
power
of
changing
the
circumstances
as
an
automaton
complete
rest
was
his
only
chance
the
physician
did
not
ask
impossibilities
you
ought
to
get
some
very
much
lighter
job
there
aint
no
light
jobs
in
my
business
well
if
you
go
on
like
this
youll
kill
yourself
youre
very
ill
dyou
mean
to
say
im
going
to
die
i
shouldnt
like
to
say
that
but
youre
certainly
unfit
for
hard
work
if
i
dont
work
whos
to
keep
the
wife
and
the
kids
dr
tyrell
shrugged
his
shoulders
the
dilemma
had
been
presented
to
him
a
hundred
times
time
was
pressing
and
there
were
many
patients
to
be
seen
well
ill
give
you
some
medicine
and
you
can
come
back
in
a
week
and
tell
me
how
youre
getting
on
the
man
took
his
letter
with
the
useless
prescription
written
upon
it
and
walked
out
the
doctor
might
say
what
he
liked
he
did
not
feel
so
bad
that
he
could
not
go
on
working
he
had
a
good
job
and
he
could
not
afford
to
throw
it
away
i
give
him
a
year
said
dr
tyrell
sometimes
there
was
comedy
now
and
then
came
a
flash
of
cockney
humour
now
and
then
some
old
lady
a
character
such
as
charles
dickens
might
have
drawn
would
amuse
them
by
her
garrulous
oddities
once
a
woman
came
who
was
a
member
of
the
ballet
at
a
famous
musichall
she
looked
fifty
but
gave
her
age
as
twentyeight
she
was
outrageously
painted
and
ogled
the
students
impudently
with
large
black
eyes
her
smiles
were
grossly
alluring
she
had
abundant
selfconfidence
and
treated
dr
tyrell
vastly
amused
with
the
easy
familiarity
with
which
she
might
have
used
an
intoxicated
admirer
she
had
chronic
bronchitis
and
told
him
it
hindered
her
in
the
exercise
of
her
profession
i
dont
know
why
i
should
ave
such
a
thing
upon
my
word
i
dont
ive
never
ad
a
days
illness
in
my
life
youve
only
got
to
look
at
me
to
know
that
she
rolled
her
eyes
round
the
young
men
with
a
long
sweep
of
her
painted
eyelashes
and
flashed
her
yellow
teeth
at
them
she
spoke
with
a
cockney
accent
but
with
an
affectation
of
refinement
which
made
every
word
a
feast
of
fun
its
what
they
call
a
winter
cough
answered
dr
tyrell
gravely
a
great
many
middleaged
women
have
it
well
i
never
that
is
a
nice
thing
to
say
to
a
lady
no
one
ever
called
me
middleaged
before
she
opened
her
eyes
very
wide
and
cocked
her
head
on
one
side
looking
at
him
with
indescribable
archness
that
is
the
disadvantage
of
our
profession
said
he
it
forces
us
sometimes
to
be
ungallant
she
took
the
prescription
and
gave
him
one
last
luscious
smile
you
will
come
and
see
me
dance
dearie
wont
you
i
will
indeed
he
rang
the
bell
for
the
next
case
i
am
glad
you
gentlemen
were
here
to
protect
me
but
on
the
whole
the
impression
was
neither
of
tragedy
nor
of
comedy
there
was
no
describing
it
it
was
manifold
and
various
there
were
tears
and
laughter
happiness
and
woe
it
was
tedious
and
interesting
and
indifferent
it
was
as
you
saw
it
it
was
tumultuous
and
passionate
it
was
grave
it
was
sad
and
comic
it
was
trivial
it
was
simple
and
complex
joy
was
there
and
despair
the
love
of
mothers
for
their
children
and
of
men
for
women
lust
trailed
itself
through
the
rooms
with
leaden
feet
punishing
the
guilty
and
the
innocent
helpless
wives
and
wretched
children
drink
seized
men
and
women
and
cost
its
inevitable
price
death
sighed
in
these
rooms
and
the
beginning
of
life
filling
some
poor
girl
with
terror
and
shame
was
diagnosed
there
there
was
neither
good
nor
bad
there
there
were
just
facts
it
was
life
chapter
lxxxii
towards
the
end
of
the
year
when
philip
was
bringing
to
a
close
his
three
months
as
clerk
in
the
outpatients
department
he
received
a
letter
from
lawson
who
was
in
paris
dear
philip

would
be
glad
to
see

you
will
be
able
to
find

a
brick
and
look
after
him
a
bit
he
is
very
down
on
his
luck
he
will
tell
you
what
he
is
doing
things
are
going
on
here
very
much
as
usual
nothing
seems
to
have
changed
since
you
were
here
clutton
is
back
but
he
has
become
quite
impossible
he
has
quarrelled
with
everybody
as
far
as
i
can
make
out
he
hasnt
got
a
cent
he
lives
in
a
little
studio
right
away
beyond
the
jardin
des
plantes
but
he
wont
let
anybody
see
his
work
he
doesnt
show
anywhere
so
one
doesnt
know
what
he
is
doing
he
may
be
a
genius
but
on
the
other
hand
he
may
be
off
his
head
by
the
way
i
ran
against
flanagan
the
other
day
he
was
showing
mrs
flanagan
round
the

he
has
chucked
art
and
is
now

much
would
you
ask

frederick
lawson
philip
wrote
to
cronshaw
and
received
in
reply
the
following
letter
it
was
written
on
a
halfsheet
of
common
notepaper
and
the
flimsy
envelope
was
dirtier
than
was
justified
by
its
passage
through
the
post
dear
carey
of
course
i
remember
you
very
well
i
have
an
idea
that
i
had
some
part
in
rescuing
you
from
the
slough
of
despond
in
which
myself
am
hopelessly
immersed
i
shall
be
glad
to
see
you
i
am
a
stranger
in
a
strange
city
and
i
am
buffeted
by
the
philistines
it
will
be
pleasant
to
talk
of
paris
i
do
not
ask
you
to
come
and
see
me
since
my
lodging
is
not
of
a
magnificence
fit
for
the
reception
of
an
eminent
member
of
monsieur
purgons
profession
but
you
will
find
me
eating
modestly
any
evening
between
seven
and
eight
at
a
restaurant
yclept
au
bon
plaisir
in
dean
street
your
sincere
j
cronshaw
philip
went
the
day
he
received
this
letter
the
restaurant
consisting
of
one
small
room
was
of
the
poorest
class
and
cronshaw
seemed
to
be
its
only
customer
he
was
sitting
in
the
corner
well
away
from
draughts
wearing
the
same
shabby
greatcoat
which
philip
had
never
seen
him
without
with
his
old
bowler
on
his
head
i
eat
here
because
i
can
be
alone
he
said
they
are
not
doing
well
the
only
people
who
come
are
a
few
trollops
and
one
or
two
waiters
out
of
a
job
they
are
giving
up
business
and
the
food
is
execrable
but
the
ruin
of
their
fortunes
is
my
advantage
cronshaw
had
before
him
a
glass
of
absinthe
it
was
nearly
three
years
since
they
had
met
and
philip
was
shocked
by
the
change
in
his
appearance
he
had
been
rather
corpulent
but
now
he
had
a
driedup
yellow
look
the
skin
of
his
neck
was
loose
and
winkled
his
clothes
hung
about
him
as
though
they
had
been
bought
for
someone
else
and
his
collar
three
or
four
sizes
too
large
added
to
the
slatternliness
of
his
appearance
his
hands
trembled
continually
philip
remembered
the
handwriting
which
scrawled
over
the
page
with
shapeless
haphazard
letters
cronshaw
was
evidently
very
ill
i
eat
little
these
days
he
said
im
very
sick
in
the
morning
im
just
having
some
soup
for
my
dinner
and
then
i
shall
have
a
bit
of
cheese
philips
glance
unconsciously
went
to
the
absinthe
and
cronshaw
seeing
it
gave
him
the
quizzical
look
with
which
he
reproved
the
admonitions
of
common
sense
you
have
diagnosed
my
case
and
you
think
its
very
wrong
of
me
to
drink
absinthe
youve
evidently
got
cirrhosis
of
the
liver
said
philip
evidently
he
looked
at
philip
in
the
way
which
had
formerly
had
the
power
of
making
him
feel
incredibly
narrow
it
seemed
to
point
out
that
what
he
was
thinking
was
distressingly
obvious
and
when
you
have
agreed
with
the
obvious
what
more
is
there
to
say
philip
changed
the
topic
when
are
you
going
back
to
paris
im
not
going
back
to
paris
im
going
to
die
the
very
naturalness
with
which
he
said
this
startled
philip
he
thought
of
half
a
dozen
things
to
say
but
they
seemed
futile
he
knew
that
cronshaw
was
a
dying
man
are
you
going
to
settle
in
london
then
he
asked
lamely
what
is
london
to
me
i
am
a
fish
out
of
water
i
walk
through
the
crowded
streets
men
jostle
me
and
i
seem
to
walk
in
a
dead
city
i
felt
that
i
couldnt
die
in
paris
i
wanted
to
die
among
my
own
people
i
dont
know
what
hidden
instinct
drew
me
back
at
the
last
philip
knew
of
the
woman
cronshaw
had
lived
with
and
the
two
draggletailed
children
but
cronshaw
had
never
mentioned
them
to
him
and
he
did
not
like
to
speak
of
them
he
wondered
what
had
happened
to
them
i
dont
know
why
you
talk
of
dying
he
said
i
had
pneumonia
a
couple
of
winters
ago
and
they
told
me
then
it
was
a
miracle
that
i
came
through
it
appears
im
extremely
liable
to
it
and
another
bout
will
kill
me
oh
what
nonsense
youre
not
so
bad
as
all
that
youve
only
got
to
take
precautions
why
dont
you
give
up
drinking
because
i
dont
choose
it
doesnt
matter
what
a
man
does
if
hes
ready
to
take
the
consequences
well
im
ready
to
take
the
consequences
you
talk
glibly
of
giving
up
drinking
but
its
the
only
thing
ive
got
left
now
what
do
you
think
life
would
be
to
me
without
it
can
you
understand
the
happiness
i
get
out
of
my
absinthe
i
yearn
for
it
and
when
i
drink
it
i
savour
every
drop
and
afterwards
i
feel
my
soul
swimming
in
ineffable
happiness
it
disgusts
you
you
are
a
puritan
and
in
your
heart
you
despise
sensual
pleasures
sensual
pleasures
are
the
most
violent
and
the
most
exquisite
i
am
a
man
blessed
with
vivid
senses
and
i
have
indulged
them
with
all
my
soul
i
have
to
pay
the
penalty
now
and
i
am
ready
to
pay
philip
looked
at
him
for
a
while
steadily
arent
you
afraid
for
a
moment
cronshaw
did
not
answer
he
seemed
to
consider
his
reply
sometimes
when
im
alone
he
looked
at
philip
you
think
thats
a
condemnation
youre
wrong
im
not
afraid
of
my
fear
its
folly
the
christian
argument
that
you
should
live
always
in
view
of
your
death
the
only
way
to
live
is
to
forget
that
youre
going
to
die
death
is
unimportant
the
fear
of
it
should
never
influence
a
single
action
of
the
wise
man
i
know
that
i
shall
die
struggling
for
breath
and
i
know
that
i
shall
be
horribly
afraid
i
know
that
i
shall
not
be
able
to
keep
myself
from
regretting
bitterly
the
life
that
has
brought
me
to
such
a
pass
but
i
disown
that
regret
i
now
weak
old
diseased
poor
dying
hold
still
my
soul
in
my
hands
and
i
regret
nothing
dyou
remember
that
persian
carpet
you
gave
me
asked
philip
cronshaw
smiled
his
old
slow
smile
of
past
days
i
told
you
that
it
would
give
you
an
answer
to
your
question
when
you
asked
me
what
was
the
meaning
of
life
well
have
you
discovered
the
answer
no
smiled
philip
wont
you
tell
it
me
no
no
i
cant
do
that
the
answer
is
meaningless
unless
you
discover
it
for
yourself
chapter
lxxxiii
cronshaw
was
publishing
his
poems
his
friends
had
been
urging
him
to
do
this
for
years
but
his
laziness
made
it
impossible
for
him
to
take
the
necessary
steps
he
had
always
answered
their
exhortations
by
telling
them
that
the
love
of
poetry
was
dead
in
england
you
brought
out
a
book
which
had
cost
you
years
of
thought
and
labour
it
was
given
two
or
three
contemptuous
lines
among
a
batch
of
similar
volumes
twenty
or
thirty
copies
were
sold
and
the
rest
of
the
edition
was
pulped
he
had
long
since
worn
out
the
desire
for
fame
that
was
an
illusion
like
all
else
but
one
of
his
friends
had
taken
the
matter
into
his
own
hands
this
was
a
man
of
letters
named
leonard
upjohn
whom
philip
had
met
once
or
twice
with
cronshaw
in
the
cafes
of
the
quarter
he
had
a
considerable
reputation
in
england
as
a
critic
and
was
the
accredited
exponent
in
this
country
of
modern
french
literature
he
had
lived
a
good
deal
in
france
among
the
men
who
made
the
mercure
de
france
the
liveliest
review
of
the
day
and
by
the
simple
process
of
expressing
in
english
their
point
of
view
he
had
acquired
in
england
a
reputation
for
originality
philip
had
read
some
of
his
articles
he
had
formed
a
style
for
himself
by
a
close
imitation
of
sir
thomas
browne
he
used
elaborate
sentences
carefully
balanced
and
obsolete
resplendent
words
it
gave
his
writing
an
appearance
of
individuality
leonard
upjohn
had
induced
cronshaw
to
give
him
all
his
poems
and
found
that
there
were
enough
to
make
a
volume
of
reasonable
size
he
promised
to
use
his
influence
with
publishers
cronshaw
was
in
want
of
money
since
his
illness
he
had
found
it
more
difficult
than
ever
to
work
steadily
he
made
barely
enough
to
keep
himself
in
liquor
and
when
upjohn
wrote
to
him
that
this
publisher
and
the
other
though
admiring
the
poems
thought
it
not
worth
while
to
publish
them
cronshaw
began
to
grow
interested
he
wrote
impressing
upon
upjohn
his
great
need
and
urging
him
to
make
more
strenuous
efforts
now
that
he
was
going
to
die
he
wanted
to
leave
behind
him
a
published
book
and
at
the
back
of
his
mind
was
the
feeling
that
he
had
produced
great
poetry
he
expected
to
burst
upon
the
world
like
a
new
star
there
was
something
fine
in
keeping
to
himself
these
treasures
of
beauty
all
his
life
and
giving
them
to
the
world
disdainfully
when
he
and
the
world
parting
company
he
had
no
further
use
for
them
his
decision
to
come
to
england
was
caused
directly
by
an
announcement
from
leonard
upjohn
that
a
publisher
had
consented
to
print
the
poems
by
a
miracle
of
persuasion
upjohn
had
persuaded
him
to
give
ten
pounds
in
advance
of
royalties
in
advance
of
royalties
mind
you
said
cronshaw
to
philip
milton
only
got
ten
pounds
down
upjohn
had
promised
to
write
a
signed
article
about
them
and
he
would
ask
his
friends
who
reviewed
to
do
their
best
cronshaw
pretended
to
treat
the
matter
with
detachment
but
it
was
easy
to
see
that
he
was
delighted
with
the
thought
of
the
stir
he
would
make
one
day
philip
went
to
dine
by
arrangement
at
the
wretched
eatinghouse
at
which
cronshaw
insisted
on
taking
his
meals
but
cronshaw
did
not
appear
philip
learned
that
he
had
not
been
there
for
three
days
he
got
himself
something
to
eat
and
went
round
to
the
address
from
which
cronshaw
had
first
written
to
him
he
had
some
difficulty
in
finding
hyde
street
it
was
a
street
of
dingy
houses
huddled
together
many
of
the
windows
had
been
broken
and
were
clumsily
repaired
with
strips
of
french
newspaper
the
doors
had
not
been
painted
for
years
there
were
shabby
little
shops
on
the
ground
floor
laundries
cobblers
stationers
ragged
children
played
in
the
road
and
an
old
barrelorgan
was
grinding
out
a
vulgar
tune
philip
knocked
at
the
door
of
cronshaws
house
there
was
a
shop
of
cheap
sweetstuffs
at
the
bottom
and
it
was
opened
by
an
elderly
frenchwoman
in
a
dirty
apron
philip
asked
her
if
cronshaw
was
in
ah
yes
there
is
an
englishman
who
lives
at
the
top
at
the
back
i
dont
know
if
hes
in
if
you
want
him
you
had
better
go
up
and
see
the
staircase
was
lit
by
one
jet
of
gas
there
was
a
revolting
odour
in
the
house
when
philip
was
passing
up
a
woman
came
out
of
a
room
on
the
first
floor
looked
at
him
suspiciously
but
made
no
remark
there
were
three
doors
on
the
top
landing
philip
knocked
at
one
and
knocked
again
there
was
no
reply
he
tried
the
handle
but
the
door
was
locked
he
knocked
at
another
door
got
no
answer
and
tried
the
door
again
it
opened
the
room
was
dark
whos
that
he
recognised
cronshaws
voice
carey
can
i
come
in
he
received
no
answer
he
walked
in
the
window
was
closed
and
the
stink
was
overpowering
there
was
a
certain
amount
of
light
from
the
arclamp
in
the
street
and
he
saw
that
it
was
a
small
room
with
two
beds
in
it
end
to
end
there
was
a
washingstand
and
one
chair
but
they
left
little
space
for
anyone
to
move
in
cronshaw
was
in
the
bed
nearest
the
window
he
made
no
movement
but
gave
a
low
chuckle
why
dont
you
light
the
candle
he
said
then
philip
struck
a
match
and
discovered
that
there
was
a
candlestick
on
the
floor
beside
the
bed
he
lit
it
and
put
it
on
the
washingstand
cronshaw
was
lying
on
his
back
immobile
he
looked
very
odd
in
his
nightshirt
and
his
baldness
was
disconcerting
his
face
was
earthy
and
deathlike
i
say
old
man
you
look
awfully
ill
is
there
anyone
to
look
after
you
here
george
brings
me
in
a
bottle
of
milk
in
the
morning
before
he
goes
to
his
work
whos
george
i
call
him
george
because
his
name
is
adolphe
he
shares
this
palatial
apartment
with
me
philip
noticed
then
that
the
second
bed
had
not
been
made
since
it
was
slept
in
the
pillow
was
black
where
the
head
had
rested
you
dont
mean
to
say
youre
sharing
this
room
with
somebody
else
he
cried
why
not
lodging
costs
money
in
soho
george
is
a
waiter
he
goes
out
at
eight
in
the
morning
and
does
not
come
in
till
closing
time
so
he
isnt
in
my
way
at
all
we
neither
of
us
sleep
well
and
he
helps
to
pass
away
the
hours
of
the
night
by
telling
me
stories
of
his
life
hes
a
swiss
and
ive
always
had
a
taste
for
waiters
they
see
life
from
an
entertaining
angle
how
long
have
you
been
in
bed
three
days
dyou
mean
to
say
youve
had
nothing
but
a
bottle
of
milk
for
the
last
three
days
why
on
earth
didnt
you
send
me
a
line
i
cant
bear
to
think
of
you
lying
here
all
day
long
without
a
soul
to
attend
to
you
cronshaw
gave
a
little
laugh
look
at
your
face
why
dear
boy
i
really
believe
youre
distressed
you
nice
fellow
philip
blushed
he
had
not
suspected
that
his
face
showed
the
dismay
he
felt
at
the
sight
of
that
horrible
room
and
the
wretched
circumstances
of
the
poor
poet
cronshaw
watching
philip
went
on
with
a
gentle
smile
ive
been
quite
happy
look
here
are
my
proofs
remember
that
i
am
indifferent
to
discomforts
which
would
harass
other
folk
what
do
the
circumstances
of
life
matter
if
your
dreams
make
you
lord
paramount
of
time
and
space
the
proofs
were
lying
on
his
bed
and
as
he
lay
in
the
darkness
he
had
been
able
to
place
his
hands
on
them
he
showed
them
to
philip
and
his
eyes
glowed
he
turned
over
the
pages
rejoicing
in
the
clear
type
he
read
out
a
stanza
they
dont
look
bad
do
they
philip
had
an
idea
it
would
involve
him
in
a
little
expense
and
he
could
not
afford
even
the
smallest
increase
of
expenditure
but
on
the
other
hand
this
was
a
case
where
it
revolted
him
to
think
of
economy
i
say
i
cant
bear
the
thought
of
your
remaining
here
ive
got
an
extra
room
its
empty
at
present
but
i
can
easily
get
someone
to
lend
me
a
bed
wont
you
come
and
live
with
me
for
a
while
itll
save
you
the
rent
of
this
oh
my
dear
boy
youd
insist
on
my
keeping
my
window
open
you
shall
have
every
window
in
the
place
sealed
if
you
like
i
shall
be
all
right
tomorrow
i
could
have
got
up
today
only
i
felt
lazy
then
you
can
very
easily
make
the
move
and
then
if
you
dont
feel
well
at
any
time
you
can
just
go
to
bed
and
i
shall
be
there
to
look
after
you
if
itll
please
you
ill
come
said
cronshaw
with
his
torpid
not
unpleasant
smile
thatll
be
ripping
they
settled
that
philip
should
fetch
cronshaw
next
day
and
philip
snatched
an
hour
from
his
busy
morning
to
arrange
the
change
he
found
cronshaw
dressed
sitting
in
his
hat
and
greatcoat
on
the
bed
with
a
small
shabby
portmanteau
containing
his
clothes
and
books
already
packed
it
was
on
the
floor
by
his
feet
and
he
looked
as
if
he
were
sitting
in
the
waitingroom
of
a
station
philip
laughed
at
the
sight
of
him
they
went
over
to
kennington
in
a
fourwheeler
of
which
the
windows
were
carefully
closed
and
philip
installed
his
guest
in
his
own
room
he
had
gone
out
early
in
the
morning
and
bought
for
himself
a
secondhand
bedstead
a
cheap
chest
of
drawers
and
a
lookingglass
cronshaw
settled
down
at
once
to
correct
his
proofs
he
was
much
better
philip
found
him
except
for
the
irritability
which
was
a
symptom
of
his
disease
an
easy
guest
he
had
a
lecture
at
nine
in
the
morning
so
did
not
see
cronshaw
till
the
night
once
or
twice
philip
persuaded
him
to
share
the
scrappy
meal
he
prepared
for
himself
in
the
evening
but
cronshaw
was
too
restless
to
stay
in
and
preferred
generally
to
get
himself
something
to
eat
in
one
or
other
of
the
cheapest
restaurants
in
soho
philip
asked
him
to
see
dr
tyrell
but
he
stoutly
refused
he
knew
a
doctor
would
tell
him
to
stop
drinking
and
this
he
was
resolved
not
to
do
he
always
felt
horribly
ill
in
the
morning
but
his
absinthe
at
midday
put
him
on
his
feet
again
and
by
the
time
he
came
home
at
midnight
he
was
able
to
talk
with
the
brilliancy
which
had
astonished
philip
when
first
he
made
his
acquaintance
his
proofs
were
corrected
and
the
volume
was
to
come
out
among
the
publications
of
the
early
spring
when
the
public
might
be
supposed
to
have
recovered
from
the
avalanche
of
christmas
books
chapter
lxxxiv
at
the
new
year
philip
became
dresser
in
the
surgical
outpatients
department
the
work
was
of
the
same
character
as
that
which
he
had
just
been
engaged
on
but
with
the
greater
directness
which
surgery
has
than
medicine
and
a
larger
proportion
of
the
patients
suffered
from
those
two
diseases
which
a
supine
public
allows
in
its
prudishness
to
be
spread
broadcast
the
assistantsurgeon
for
whom
philip
dressed
was
called
jacobs
he
was
a
short
fat
man
with
an
exuberant
joviality
a
bald
head
and
a
loud
voice
he
had
a
cockney
accent
and
was
generally
described
by
the
students
as
an
awful
bounder
but
his
cleverness
both
as
a
surgeon
and
as
a
teacher
caused
some
of
them
to
overlook
this
he
had
also
a
considerable
facetiousness
which
he
exercised
impartially
on
the
patients
and
on
the
students
he
took
a
great
pleasure
in
making
his
dresses
look
foolish
since
they
were
ignorant
nervous
and
could
not
answer
as
if
he
were
their
equal
this
was
not
very
difficult
he
enjoyed
his
afternoons
with
the
home
truths
he
permitted
himself
much
more
than
the
students
who
had
to
put
up
with
them
with
a
smile
one
day
a
case
came
up
of
a
boy
with
a
clubfoot
his
parents
wanted
to
know
whether
anything
could
be
done
mr
jacobs
turned
to
philip
youd
better
take
this
case
carey
its
a
subject
you
ought
to
know
something
about
philip
flushed
all
the
more
because
the
surgeon
spoke
obviously
with
a
humorous
intention
and
his
browbeaten
dressers
laughed
obsequiously
it
was
in
point
of
fact
a
subject
which
philip
since
coming
to
the
hospital
had
studied
with
anxious
attention
he
had
read
everything
in
the
library
which
treated
of
talipes
in
its
various
forms
he
made
the
boy
take
off
his
boot
and
stocking
he
was
fourteen
with
a
snub
nose
blue
eyes
and
a
freckled
face
his
father
explained
that
they
wanted
something
done
if
possible
it
was
such
a
hindrance
to
the
kid
in
earning
his
living
philip
looked
at
him
curiously
he
was
a
jolly
boy
not
at
all
shy
but
talkative
and
with
a
cheekiness
which
his
father
reproved
he
was
much
interested
in
his
foot
its
only
for
the
looks
of
the
thing
you
know
he
said
to
philip
i
dont
find
it
no
trouble
be
quiet
ernie
said
his
father
theres
too
much
gas
about
you
philip
examined
the
foot
and
passed
his
hand
slowly
over
the
shapelessness
of
it
he
could
not
understand
why
the
boy
felt
none
of
the
humiliation
which
always
oppressed
himself
he
wondered
why
he
could
not
take
his
deformity
with
that
philosophic
indifference
presently
mr
jacobs
came
up
to
him
the
boy
was
sitting
on
the
edge
of
a
couch
the
surgeon
and
philip
stood
on
each
side
of
him
and
in
a
semicircle
crowding
round
were
students
with
accustomed
brilliancy
jacobs
gave
a
graphic
little
discourse
upon
the
clubfoot
he
spoke
of
its
varieties
and
of
the
forms
which
followed
upon
different
anatomical
conditions
i
suppose
youve
got
talipes
equinus
he
said
turning
suddenly
to
philip
yes
philip
felt
the
eyes
of
his
fellowstudents
rest
on
him
and
he
cursed
himself
because
he
could
not
help
blushing
he
felt
the
sweat
start
up
in
the
palms
of
his
hands
the
surgeon
spoke
with
the
fluency
due
to
long
practice
and
with
the
admirable
perspicacity
which
distinguished
him
he
was
tremendously
interested
in
his
profession
but
philip
did
not
listen
he
was
only
wishing
that
the
fellow
would
get
done
quickly
suddenly
he
realised
that
jacobs
was
addressing
him
you
dont
mind
taking
off
your
sock
for
a
moment
carey
philip
felt
a
shudder
pass
through
him
he
had
an
impulse
to
tell
the
surgeon
to
go
to
hell
but
he
had
not
the
courage
to
make
a
scene
he
feared
his
brutal
ridicule
he
forced
himself
to
appear
indifferent
not
a
bit
he
said
he
sat
down
and
unlaced
his
boot
his
fingers
were
trembling
and
he
thought
he
should
never
untie
the
knot
he
remembered
how
they
had
forced
him
at
school
to
show
his
foot
and
the
misery
which
had
eaten
into
his
soul
he
keeps
his
feet
nice
and
clean
doesnt
he
said
jacobs
in
his
rasping
cockney
voice
the
attendant
students
giggled
philip
noticed
that
the
boy
whom
they
were
examining
looked
down
at
his
foot
with
eager
curiosity
jacobs
took
the
foot
in
his
hands
and
said
yes
thats
what
i
thought
i
see
youve
had
an
operation
when
you
were
a
child
i
suppose
he
went
on
with
his
fluent
explanations
the
students
leaned
over
and
looked
at
the
foot
two
or
three
examined
it
minutely
when
jacobs
let
it
go
when
youve
quite
done
said
philip
with
a
smile
ironically
he
could
have
killed
them
all
he
thought
how
jolly
it
would
be
to
jab
a
chisel
he
didnt
know
why
that
particular
instrument
came
into
his
mind
into
their
necks
what
beasts
men
were
he
wished
he
could
believe
in
hell
so
as
to
comfort
himself
with
the
thought
of
the
horrible
tortures
which
would
be
theirs
mr
jacobs
turned
his
attention
to
treatment
he
talked
partly
to
the
boys
father
and
partly
to
the
students
philip
put
on
his
sock
and
laced
his
boot
at
last
the
surgeon
finished
but
he
seemed
to
have
an
afterthought
and
turned
to
philip
you
know
i
think
it
might
be
worth
your
while
to
have
an
operation
of
course
i
couldnt
give
you
a
normal
foot
but
i
think
i
can
do
something
you
might
think
about
it
and
when
you
want
a
holiday
you
can
just
come
into
the
hospital
for
a
bit
philip
had
often
asked
himself
whether
anything
could
be
done
but
his
distaste
for
any
reference
to
the
subject
had
prevented
him
from
consulting
any
of
the
surgeons
at
the
hospital
his
reading
told
him
that
whatever
might
have
been
done
when
he
was
a
small
boy
and
then
treatment
of
talipes
was
not
as
skilful
as
in
the
present
day
there
was
small
chance
now
of
any
great
benefit
still
it
would
be
worth
while
if
an
operation
made
it
possible
for
him
to
wear
a
more
ordinary
boot
and
to
limp
less
he
remembered
how
passionately
he
had
prayed
for
the
miracle
which
his
uncle
had
assured
him
was
possible
to
omnipotence
he
smiled
ruefully
i
was
rather
a
simple
soul
in
those
days
he
thought
towards
the
end
of
february
it
was
clear
that
cronshaw
was
growing
much
worse
he
was
no
longer
able
to
get
up
he
lay
in
bed
insisting
that
the
window
should
be
closed
always
and
refused
to
see
a
doctor
he
would
take
little
nourishment
but
demanded
whiskey
and
cigarettes
philip
knew
that
he
should
have
neither
but
cronshaws
argument
was
unanswerable
i
daresay
they
are
killing
me
i
dont
care
youve
warned
me
youve
done
all
that
was
necessary
i
ignore
your
warning
give
me
something
to
drink
and
be
damned
to
you
leonard
upjohn
blew
in
two
or
three
times
a
week
and
there
was
something
of
the
dead
leaf
in
his
appearance
which
made
the
word
exactly
descriptive
of
the
manner
of
his
appearance
he
was
a
weedylooking
fellow
of
fiveandthirty
with
long
pale
hair
and
a
white
face
he
had
the
look
of
a
man
who
lived
too
little
in
the
open
air
he
wore
a
hat
like
a
dissenting
ministers
philip
disliked
him
for
his
patronising
manner
and
was
bored
by
his
fluent
conversation
leonard
upjohn
liked
to
hear
himself
talk
he
was
not
sensitive
to
the
interest
of
his
listeners
which
is
the
first
requisite
of
the
good
talker
and
he
never
realised
that
he
was
telling
people
what
they
knew
already
with
measured
words
he
told
philip
what
to
think
of
rodin
albert
samain
and
caesar
franck
philips
charwoman
only
came
in
for
an
hour
in
the
morning
and
since
philip
was
obliged
to
be
at
the
hospital
all
day
cronshaw
was
left
much
alone
upjohn
told
philip
that
he
thought
someone
should
remain
with
him
but
did
not
offer
to
make
it
possible
its
dreadful
to
think
of
that
great
poet
alone
why
he
might
die
without
a
soul
at
hand
i
think
he
very
probably
will
said
philip
how
can
you
be
so
callous
why
dont
you
come
and
do
your
work
here
every
day
and
then
youd
be
near
if
he
wanted
anything
asked
philip
drily
i
my
dear
fellow
i
can
only
work
in
the
surroundings
im
used
to
and
besides
i
go
out
so
much
upjohn
was
also
a
little
put
out
because
philip
had
brought
cronshaw
to
his
own
rooms
i
wish
you
had
left
him
in
soho
he
said
with
a
wave
of
his
long
thin
hands
there
was
a
touch
of
romance
in
that
sordid
attic
i
could
even
bear
it
if
it
were
wapping
or
shoreditch
but
the
respectability
of
kennington
what
a
place
for
a
poet
to
die
cronshaw
was
often
so
illhumoured
that
philip
could
only
keep
his
temper
by
remembering
all
the
time
that
this
irritability
was
a
symptom
of
the
disease
upjohn
came
sometimes
before
philip
was
in
and
then
cronshaw
would
complain
of
him
bitterly
upjohn
listened
with
complacency
the
fact
is
that
carey
has
no
sense
of
beauty
he
smiled
he
has
a
middleclass
mind
he
was
very
sarcastic
to
philip
and
philip
exercised
a
good
deal
of
selfcontrol
in
his
dealings
with
him
but
one
evening
he
could
not
contain
himself
he
had
had
a
hard
day
at
the
hospital
and
was
tired
out
leonard
upjohn
came
to
him
while
he
was
making
himself
a
cup
of
tea
in
the
kitchen
and
said
that
cronshaw
was
complaining
of
philips
insistence
that
he
should
have
a
doctor
dont
you
realise
that
youre
enjoying
a
very
rare
a
very
exquisite
privilege
you
ought
to
do
everything
in
your
power
surely
to
show
your
sense
of
the
greatness
of
your
trust
its
a
rare
and
exquisite
privilege
which
i
can
ill
afford
said
philip
whenever
there
was
any
question
of
money
leonard
upjohn
assumed
a
slightly
disdainful
expression
his
sensitive
temperament
was
offended
by
the
reference
theres
something
fine
in
cronshaws
attitude
and
you
disturb
it
by
your
importunity
you
should
make
allowances
for
the
delicate
imaginings
which
you
cannot
feel
philips
face
darkened
let
us
go
in
to
cronshaw
he
said
frigidly
the
poet
was
lying
on
his
back
reading
a
book
with
a
pipe
in
his
mouth
the
air
was
musty
and
the
room
notwithstanding
philips
tidying
up
had
the
bedraggled
look
which
seemed
to
accompany
cronshaw
wherever
he
went
he
took
off
his
spectacles
as
they
came
in
philip
was
in
a
towering
rage
upjohn
tells
me
youve
been
complaining
to
him
because
ive
urged
you
to
have
a
doctor
he
said
i
want
you
to
have
a
doctor
because
you
may
die
any
day
and
if
you
hadnt
been
seen
by
anyone
i
shouldnt
be
able
to
get
a
certificate
thered
have
to
be
an
inquest
and
i
should
be
blamed
for
not
calling
a
doctor
in
i
hadnt
thought
of
that
i
thought
you
wanted
me
to
see
a
doctor
for
my
sake
and
not
for
your
own
ill
see
a
doctor
whenever
you
like
philip
did
not
answer
but
gave
an
almost
imperceptible
shrug
of
the
shoulders
cronshaw
watching
him
gave
a
little
chuckle
dont
look
so
angry
my
dear
i
know
very
well
you
want
to
do
everything
you
can
for
me
lets
see
your
doctor
perhaps
he
can
do
something
for
me
and
at
any
rate
itll
comfort
you
he
turned
his
eyes
to
upjohn
youre
a
damned
fool
leonard
why
dyou
want
to
worry
the
boy
he
has
quite
enough
to
do
to
put
up
with
me
youll
do
nothing
more
for
me
than
write
a
pretty
article
about
me
after
my
death
i
know
you
next
day
philip
went
to
dr
tyrell
he
felt
that
he
was
the
sort
of
man
to
be
interested
by
the
story
and
as
soon
as
tyrell
was
free
of
his
days
work
he
accompanied
philip
to
kennington
he
could
only
agree
with
what
philip
had
told
him
the
case
was
hopeless
ill
take
him
into
the
hospital
if
you
like
he
said
he
can
have
a
small
ward
nothing
would
induce
him
to
come
you
know
he
may
die
any
minute
or
else
he
may
get
another
attack
of
pneumonia
philip
nodded
dr
tyrell
made
one
or
two
suggestions
and
promised
to
come
again
whenever
philip
wanted
him
to
he
left
his
address
when
philip
went
back
to
cronshaw
he
found
him
quietly
reading
he
did
not
trouble
to
inquire
what
the
doctor
had
said
are
you
satisfied
now
dear
boy
he
asked
i
suppose
nothing
will
induce
you
to
do
any
of
the
things
tyrell
advised
nothing
smiled
cronshaw
chapter
lxxxv
about
a
fortnight
after
this
philip
going
home
one
evening
after
his
days
work
at
the
hospital
knocked
at
the
door
of
cronshaws
room
he
got
no
answer
and
walked
in
cronshaw
was
lying
huddled
up
on
one
side
and
philip
went
up
to
the
bed
he
did
not
know
whether
cronshaw
was
asleep
or
merely
lay
there
in
one
of
his
uncontrollable
fits
of
irritability
he
was
surprised
to
see
that
his
mouth
was
open
he
touched
his
shoulder
philip
gave
a
cry
of
dismay
he
slipped
his
hand
under
cronshaws
shirt
and
felt
his
heart
he
did
not
know
what
to
do
helplessly
because
he
had
heard
of
this
being
done
he
held
a
lookingglass
in
front
of
his
mouth
it
startled
him
to
be
alone
with
cronshaw
he
had
his
hat
and
coat
still
on
and
he
ran
down
the
stairs
into
the
street
he
hailed
a
cab
and
drove
to
harley
street
dr
tyrell
was
in
i
say
would
you
mind
coming
at
once
i
think
cronshaws
dead
if
he
is
its
not
much
good
my
coming
is
it
i
should
be
awfully
grateful
if
you
would
ive
got
a
cab
at
the
door
itll
only
take
half
an
hour
tyrell
put
on
his
hat
in
the
cab
he
asked
him
one
or
two
questions
he
seemed
no
worse
than
usual
when
i
left
this
morning
said
philip
it
gave
me
an
awful
shock
when
i
went
in
just
now
and
the
thought
of
his
dying
all
alone
dyou
think
he
knew
he
was
going
to
die
philip
remembered
what
cronshaw
had
said
he
wondered
whether
at
that
last
moment
he
had
been
seized
with
the
terror
of
death
philip
imagined
himself
in
such
a
plight
knowing
it
was
inevitable
and
with
no
one
not
a
soul
to
give
an
encouraging
word
when
the
fear
seized
him
youre
rather
upset
said
dr
tyrell
he
looked
at
him
with
his
bright
blue
eyes
they
were
not
unsympathetic
when
he
saw
cronshaw
he
said
he
must
have
been
dead
for
some
hours
i
should
think
he
died
in
his
sleep
they
do
sometimes
the
body
looked
shrunk
and
ignoble
it
was
not
like
anything
human
dr
tyrell
looked
at
it
dispassionately
with
a
mechanical
gesture
he
took
out
his
watch
well
i
must
be
getting
along
ill
send
the
certificate
round
i
suppose
youll
communicate
with
the
relatives
i
dont
think
there
are
any
said
philip
how
about
the
funeral
oh
ill
see
to
that
dr
tyrell
gave
philip
a
glance
he
wondered
whether
he
ought
to
offer
a
couple
of
sovereigns
towards
it
he
knew
nothing
of
philips
circumstances
perhaps
he
could
well
afford
the
expense
philip
might
think
it
impertinent
if
he
made
any
suggestion
well
let
me
know
if
theres
anything
i
can
do
he
said
philip
and
he
went
out
together
parting
on
the
doorstep
and
philip
went
to
a
telegraph
office
in
order
to
send
a
message
to
leonard
upjohn
then
he
went
to
an
undertaker
whose
shop
he
passed
every
day
on
his
way
to
the
hospital
his
attention
had
been
drawn
to
it
often
by
the
three
words
in
silver
lettering
on
a
black
cloth
which
with
two
model
coffins
adorned
the
window
economy
celerity
propriety
they
had
always
diverted
him
the
undertaker
was
a
little
fat
jew
with
curly
black
hair
long
and
greasy
in
black
with
a
large
diamond
ring
on
a
podgy
finger
he
received
philip
with
a
peculiar
manner
formed
by
the
mingling
of
his
natural
blatancy
with
the
subdued
air
proper
to
his
calling
he
quickly
saw
that
philip
was
very
helpless
and
promised
to
send
round
a
woman
at
once
to
perform
the
needful
offices
his
suggestions
for
the
funeral
were
very
magnificent
and
philip
felt
ashamed
of
himself
when
the
undertaker
seemed
to
think
his
objections
mean
it
was
horrible
to
haggle
on
such
a
matter
and
finally
philip
consented
to
an
expensiveness
which
he
could
ill
afford
i
quite
understand
sir
said
the
undertaker
you
dont
want
any
show
and
thatim
not
a
believer
in
ostentation
myself
mind
youbut
you
want
it
done
gentlemanlylike
you
leave
it
to
me
ill
do
it
as
cheap
as
it
can
be
done
aving
regard
to
whats
right
and
proper
i
cant
say
more
than
that
can
i
philip
went
home
to
eat
his
supper
and
while
he
ate
the
woman
came
along
to
lay
out
the
corpse
presently
a
telegram
arrived
from
leonard
upjohn
shocked
and
grieved
beyond
measure
regret
cannot
come
tonight
dining
out
with
you
early
tomorrow
deepest
sympathy
upjohn
in
a
little
while
the
woman
knocked
at
the
door
of
the
sittingroom
ive
done
now
sir
will
you
come
and
look
at
im
and
see
its
all
right
philip
followed
her
cronshaw
was
lying
on
his
back
with
his
eyes
closed
and
his
hands
folded
piously
across
his
chest
you
ought
by
rights
to
ave
a
few
flowers
sir
ill
get
some
tomorrow
she
gave
the
body
a
glance
of
satisfaction
she
had
performed
her
job
and
now
she
rolled
down
her
sleeves
took
off
her
apron
and
put
on
her
bonnet
philip
asked
her
how
much
he
owed
her
well
sir
some
give
me
two
and
sixpence
and
some
give
me
five
shillings
philip
was
ashamed
to
give
her
less
than
the
larger
sum
she
thanked
him
with
just
so
much
effusiveness
as
was
seemly
in
presence
of
the
grief
he
might
be
supposed
to
feel
and
left
him
philip
went
back
into
his
sittingroom
cleared
away
the
remains
of
his
supper
and
sat
down
to
read
walshams
surgery
he
found
it
difficult
he
felt
singularly
nervous
when
there
was
a
sound
on
the
stairs
he
jumped
and
his
heart
beat
violently
that
thing
in
the
adjoining
room
which
had
been
a
man
and
now
was
nothing
frightened
him
the
silence
seemed
alive
as
if
some
mysterious
movement
were
taking
place
within
it
the
presence
of
death
weighed
upon
these
rooms
unearthly
and
terrifying
philip
felt
a
sudden
horror
for
what
had
once
been
his
friend
he
tried
to
force
himself
to
read
but
presently
pushed
away
his
book
in
despair
what
troubled
him
was
the
absolute
futility
of
the
life
which
had
just
ended
it
did
not
matter
if
cronshaw
was
alive
or
dead
it
would
have
been
just
as
well
if
he
had
never
lived
philip
thought
of
cronshaw
young
and
it
needed
an
effort
of
imagination
to
picture
him
slender
with
a
springing
step
and
with
hair
on
his
head
buoyant
and
hopeful
philips
rule
of
life
to
follow
ones
instincts
with
due
regard
to
the
policeman
round
the
corner
had
not
acted
very
well
there
it
was
because
cronshaw
had
done
this
that
he
had
made
such
a
lamentable
failure
of
existence
it
seemed
that
the
instincts
could
not
be
trusted
philip
was
puzzled
and
he
asked
himself
what
rule
of
life
was
there
if
that
one
was
useless
and
why
people
acted
in
one
way
rather
than
in
another
they
acted
according
to
their
emotions
but
their
emotions
might
be
good
or
bad
it
seemed
just
a
chance
whether
they
led
to
triumph
or
disaster
life
seemed
an
inextricable
confusion
men
hurried
hither
and
thither
urged
by
forces
they
knew
not
and
the
purpose
of
it
all
escaped
them
they
seemed
to
hurry
just
for
hurryings
sake
next
morning
leonard
upjohn
appeared
with
a
small
wreath
of
laurel
he
was
pleased
with
his
idea
of
crowning
the
dead
poet
with
this
and
attempted
notwithstanding
philips
disapproving
silence
to
fix
it
on
the
bald
head
but
the
wreath
fitted
grotesquely
it
looked
like
the
brim
of
a
hat
worn
by
a
low
comedian
in
a
musichall
ill
put
it
over
his
heart
instead
said
upjohn
youve
put
it
on
his
stomach
remarked
philip
upjohn
gave
a
thin
smile
only
a
poet
knows
where
lies
a
poets
heart
he
answered
they
went
back
into
the
sittingroom
and
philip
told
him
what
arrangements
he
had
made
for
the
funeral
i
hoped
youve
spared
no
expense
i
should
like
the
hearse
to
be
followed
by
a
long
string
of
empty
coaches
and
i
should
like
the
horses
to
wear
tall
nodding
plumes
and
there
should
be
a
vast
number
of
mutes
with
long
streamers
on
their
hats
i
like
the
thought
of
all
those
empty
coaches
as
the
cost
of
the
funeral
will
apparently
fall
on
me
and
im
not
over
flush
just
now
ive
tried
to
make
it
as
moderate
as
possible
but
my
dear
fellow
in
that
case
why
didnt
you
get
him
a
paupers
funeral
there
would
have
been
something
poetic
in
that
you
have
an
unerring
instinct
for
mediocrity
philip
flushed
a
little
but
did
not
answer
and
next
day
he
and
upjohn
followed
the
hearse
in
the
one
carriage
which
philip
had
ordered
lawson
unable
to
come
had
sent
a
wreath
and
philip
so
that
the
coffin
should
not
seem
too
neglected
had
bought
a
couple
on
the
way
back
the
coachman
whipped
up
his
horses
philip
was
dogtired
and
presently
went
to
sleep
he
was
awakened
by
upjohns
voice
its
rather
lucky
the
poems
havent
come
out
yet
i
think
wed
better
hold
them
back
a
bit
and
ill
write
a
preface
i
began
thinking
of
it
during
the
drive
to
the
cemetery
i
believe
i
can
do
something
rather
good
anyhow
ill
start
with
an
article
in
the
saturday
philip
did
not
reply
and
there
was
silence
between
them
at
last
upjohn
said
i
daresay
id
be
wiser
not
to
whittle
away
my
copy
i
think
ill
do
an
article
for
one
of
the
reviews
and
then
i
can
just
print
it
afterwards
as
a
preface
philip
kept
his
eye
on
the
monthlies
and
a
few
weeks
later
it
appeared
the
article
made
something
of
a
stir
and
extracts
from
it
were
printed
in
many
of
the
papers
it
was
a
very
good
article
vaguely
biographical
for
no
one
knew
much
of
cronshaws
early
life
but
delicate
tender
and
picturesque
leonard
upjohn
in
his
intricate
style
drew
graceful
little
pictures
of
cronshaw
in
the
latin
quarter
talking
writing
poetry
cronshaw
became
a
picturesque
figure
an
english
verlaine
and
leonard
upjohns
coloured
phrases
took
on
a
tremulous
dignity
a
more
pathetic
grandiloquence
as
he
described
the
sordid
end
the
shabby
little
room
in
soho
and
with
a
reticence
which
was
wholly
charming
and
suggested
a
much
greater
generosity
than
modesty
allowed
him
to
state
the
efforts
he
made
to
transport
the
poet
to
some
cottage
embowered
with
honeysuckle
amid
a
flowering
orchard
and
the
lack
of
sympathy
wellmeaning
but
so
tactless
which
had
taken
the
poet
instead
to
the
vulgar
respectability
of
kennington
leonard
upjohn
described
kennington
with
that
restrained
humour
which
a
strict
adherence
to
the
vocabulary
of
sir
thomas
browne
necessitated
with
delicate
sarcasm
he
narrated
the
last
weeks
the
patience
with
which
cronshaw
bore
the
wellmeaning
clumsiness
of
the
young
student
who
had
appointed
himself
his
nurse
and
the
pitifulness
of
that
divine
vagabond
in
those
hopelessly
middleclass
surroundings
beauty
from
ashes
he
quoted
from
isaiah
it
was
a
triumph
of
irony
for
that
outcast
poet
to
die
amid
the
trappings
of
vulgar
respectability
it
reminded
leonard
upjohn
of
christ
among
the
pharisees
and
the
analogy
gave
him
opportunity
for
an
exquisite
passage
and
then
he
told
how
a
friendhis
good
taste
did
not
suffer
him
more
than
to
hint
subtly
who
the
friend
was
with
such
gracious
fancieshad
laid
a
laurel
wreath
on
the
dead
poets
heart
and
the
beautiful
dead
hands
had
seemed
to
rest
with
a
voluptuous
passion
upon
apollos
leaves
fragrant
with
the
fragrance
of
art
and
more
green
than
jade
brought
by
swart
mariners
from
the
manifold
inexplicable
china
and
an
admirable
contrast
the
article
ended
with
a
description
of
the
middleclass
ordinary
prosaic
funeral
of
him
who
should
have
been
buried
like
a
prince
or
like
a
pauper
it
was
the
crowning
buffet
the
final
victory
of
philistia
over
art
beauty
and
immaterial
things
leonard
upjohn
had
never
written
anything
better
it
was
a
miracle
of
charm
grace
and
pity
he
printed
all
cronshaws
best
poems
in
the
course
of
the
article
so
that
when
the
volume
appeared
much
of
its
point
was
gone
but
he
advanced
his
own
position
a
good
deal
he
was
thenceforth
a
critic
to
be
reckoned
with
he
had
seemed
before
a
little
aloof
but
there
was
a
warm
humanity
about
this
article
which
was
infinitely
attractive
chapter
lxxxvi
in
the
spring
philip
having
finished
his
dressing
in
the
outpatients
department
became
an
inpatients
clerk
this
appointment
lasted
six
months
the
clerk
spent
every
morning
in
the
wards
first
in
the
mens
then
in
the
womens
with
the
housephysician
he
wrote
up
cases
made
tests
and
passed
the
time
of
day
with
the
nurses
on
two
afternoons
a
week
the
physician
in
charge
went
round
with
a
little
knot
of
students
examined
the
cases
and
dispensed
information
the
work
had
not
the
excitement
the
constant
change
the
intimate
contact
with
reality
of
the
work
in
the
outpatients
department
but
philip
picked
up
a
good
deal
of
knowledge
he
got
on
very
well
with
the
patients
and
he
was
a
little
flattered
at
the
pleasure
they
showed
in
his
attendance
on
them
he
was
not
conscious
of
any
deep
sympathy
in
their
sufferings
but
he
liked
them
and
because
he
put
on
no
airs
he
was
more
popular
with
them
than
others
of
the
clerks
he
was
pleasant
encouraging
and
friendly
like
everyone
connected
with
hospitals
he
found
that
male
patients
were
more
easy
to
get
on
with
than
female
the
women
were
often
querulous
and
illtempered
they
complained
bitterly
of
the
hardworked
nurses
who
did
not
show
them
the
attention
they
thought
their
right
and
they
were
troublesome
ungrateful
and
rude
presently
philip
was
fortunate
enough
to
make
a
friend
one
morning
the
housephysician
gave
him
a
new
case
a
man
and
seating
himself
at
the
bedside
philip
proceeded
to
write
down
particulars
on
the
letter
he
noticed
on
looking
at
this
that
the
patient
was
described
as
a
journalist
his
name
was
thorpe
athelny
an
unusual
one
for
a
hospital
patient
and
his
age
was
fortyeight
he
was
suffering
from
a
sharp
attack
of
jaundice
and
had
been
taken
into
the
ward
on
account
of
obscure
symptoms
which
it
seemed
necessary
to
watch
he
answered
the
various
questions
which
it
was
philips
duty
to
ask
him
in
a
pleasant
educated
voice
since
he
was
lying
in
bed
it
was
difficult
to
tell
if
he
was
short
or
tall
but
his
small
head
and
small
hands
suggested
that
he
was
a
man
of
less
than
average
height
philip
had
the
habit
of
looking
at
peoples
hands
and
athelnys
astonished
him
they
were
very
small
with
long
tapering
fingers
and
beautiful
rosy
fingernails
they
were
very
smooth
and
except
for
the
jaundice
would
have
been
of
a
surprising
whiteness
the
patient
kept
them
outside
the
bedclothes
one
of
them
slightly
spread
out
the
second
and
third
fingers
together
and
while
he
spoke
to
philip
seemed
to
contemplate
them
with
satisfaction
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eyes
philip
glanced
at
the
mans
face
notwithstanding
the
yellowness
it
was
distinguished
he
had
blue
eyes
a
nose
of
an
imposing
boldness
hooked
aggressive
but
not
clumsy
and
a
small
beard
pointed
and
gray
he
was
rather
bald
but
his
hair
had
evidently
been
quite
fine
curling
prettily
and
he
still
wore
it
long
i
see
youre
a
journalist
said
philip
what
papers
dyou
write
for
i
write
for
all
the
papers
you
cannot
open
a
paper
without
seeing
some
of
my
writing
there
was
one
by
the
side
of
the
bed
and
reaching
for
it
he
pointed
out
an
advertisement
in
large
letters
was
the
name
of
a
firm
wellknown
to
philip
lynn
and
sedley
regent
street
london
and
below
in
type
smaller
but
still
of
some
magnitude
was
the
dogmatic
statement
procrastination
is
the
thief
of
time
then
a
question
startling
because
of
its
reasonableness
why
not
order
today
there
was
a
repetition
in
large
letters
like
the
hammering
of
conscience
on
a
murderers
heart
why
not
then
boldly
thousands
of
pairs
of
gloves
from
the
leading
markets
of
the
world
at
astounding
prices
thousands
of
pairs
of
stockings
from
the
most
reliable
manufacturers
of
the
universe
at
sensational
reductions
finally
the
question
recurred
but
flung
now
like
a
challenging
gauntlet
in
the
lists
why
not
order
today
im
the
press
representative
of
lynn
and
sedley
he
gave
a
little
wave
of
his
beautiful
hand
to
what
base
uses
philip
went
on
asking
the
regulation
questions
some
a
mere
matter
of
routine
others
artfully
devised
to
lead
the
patient
to
discover
things
which
he
might
be
expected
to
desire
to
conceal
have
you
ever
lived
abroad
asked
philip
i
was
in
spain
for
eleven
years
what
were
you
doing
there
i
was
secretary
of
the
english
water
company
at
toledo
philip
remembered
that
clutton
had
spent
some
months
in
toledo
and
the
journalists
answer
made
him
look
at
him
with
more
interest
but
he
felt
it
would
be
improper
to
show
this
it
was
necessary
to
preserve
the
distance
between
the
hospital
patient
and
the
staff
when
he
had
finished
his
examination
he
went
on
to
other
beds
thorpe
athelnys
illness
was
not
grave
and
though
remaining
very
yellow
he
soon
felt
much
better
he
stayed
in
bed
only
because
the
physician
thought
he
should
be
kept
under
observation
till
certain
reactions
became
normal
one
day
on
entering
the
ward
philip
noticed
that
athelny
pencil
in
hand
was
reading
a
book
he
put
it
down
when
philip
came
to
his
bed
may
i
see
what
youre
reading
asked
philip
who
could
never
pass
a
book
without
looking
at
it
philip
took
it
up
and
saw
that
it
was
a
volume
of
spanish
verse
the
poems
of
san
juan
de
la
cruz
and
as
he
opened
it
a
sheet
of
paper
fell
out
philip
picked
it
up
and
noticed
that
verse
was
written
upon
it
youre
not
going
to
tell
me
youve
been
occupying
your
leisure
in
writing
poetry
thats
a
most
improper
proceeding
in
a
hospital
patient
i
was
trying
to
do
some
translations
dyou
know
spanish
no
well
you
know
all
about
san
juan
de
la
cruz
dont
you
i
dont
indeed
he
was
one
of
the
spanish
mystics
hes
one
of
the
best
poets
theyve
ever
had
i
thought
it
would
be
worth
while
translating
him
into
english
may
i
look
at
your
translation
its
very
rough
said
athelny
but
he
gave
it
to
philip
with
an
alacrity
which
suggested
that
he
was
eager
for
him
to
read
it
it
was
written
in
pencil
in
a
fine
but
very
peculiar
handwriting
which
was
hard
to
read
it
was
just
like
black
letter
doesnt
it
take
you
an
awful
time
to
write
like
that
its
wonderful
i
dont
know
why
handwriting
shouldnt
be
beautiful
philip
read
the
first
verse
in
an
obscure
night
with
anxious
love
inflamed
o
happy
lot
forth
unobserved
i
went
my
house
being
now
at
rest
philip
looked
curiously
at
thorpe
athelny
he
did
not
know
whether
he
felt
a
little
shy
with
him
or
was
attracted
by
him
he
was
conscious
that
his
manner
had
been
slightly
patronising
and
he
flushed
as
it
struck
him
that
athelny
might
have
thought
him
ridiculous
what
an
unusual
name
youve
got
he
remarked
for
something
to
say
its
a
very
old
yorkshire
name
once
it
took
the
head
of
my
family
a
days
hard
riding
to
make
the
circuit
of
his
estates
but
the
mighty
are
fallen
fast
women
and
slow
horses
he
was
shortsighted
and
when
he
spoke
looked
at
you
with
a
peculiar
intensity
he
took
up
his
volume
of
poetry
you
should
read
spanish
he
said
it
is
a
noble
tongue
it
has
not
the
mellifluousness
of
italian
italian
is
the
language
of
tenors
and
organgrinders
but
it
has
grandeur
it
does
not
ripple
like
a
brook
in
a
garden
but
it
surges
tumultuous
like
a
mighty
river
in
flood
his
grandiloquence
amused
philip
but
he
was
sensitive
to
rhetoric
and
he
listened
with
pleasure
while
athelny
with
picturesque
expressions
and
the
fire
of
a
real
enthusiasm
described
to
him
the
rich
delight
of
reading
don
quixote
in
the
original
and
the
music
romantic
limpid
passionate
of
the
enchanting
calderon
i
must
get
on
with
my
work
said
philip
presently
oh
forgive
me
i
forgot
i
will
tell
my
wife
to
bring
me
a
photograph
of
toledo
and
i
will
show
it
you
come
and
talk
to
me
when
you
have
the
chance
you
dont
know
what
a
pleasure
it
gives
me
during
the
next
few
days
in
moments
snatched
whenever
there
was
opportunity
philips
acquaintance
with
the
journalist
increased
thorpe
athelny
was
a
good
talker
he
did
not
say
brilliant
things
but
he
talked
inspiringly
with
an
eager
vividness
which
fired
the
imagination
philip
living
so
much
in
a
world
of
makebelieve
found
his
fancy
teeming
with
new
pictures
athelny
had
very
good
manners
he
knew
much
more
than
philip
both
of
the
world
and
of
books
he
was
a
much
older
man
and
the
readiness
of
his
conversation
gave
him
a
certain
superiority
but
he
was
in
the
hospital
a
recipient
of
charity
subject
to
strict
rules
and
he
held
himself
between
the
two
positions
with
ease
and
humour
once
philip
asked
him
why
he
had
come
to
the
hospital
oh
my
principle
is
to
profit
by
all
the
benefits
that
society
provides
i
take
advantage
of
the
age
i
live
in
when
im
ill
i
get
myself
patched
up
in
a
hospital
and
i
have
no
false
shame
and
i
send
my
children
to
be
educated
at
the
boardschool
do
you
really
said
philip
and
a
capital
education
they
get
too
much
better
than
i
got
at
winchester
how
else
do
you
think
i
could
educate
them
at
all
ive
got
nine
you
must
come
and
see
them
all
when
i
get
home
again
will
you
id
like
to
very
much
said
philip
chapter
lxxxvii
ten
days
later
thorpe
athelny
was
well
enough
to
leave
the
hospital
he
gave
philip
his
address
and
philip
promised
to
dine
with
him
at
one
oclock
on
the
following
sunday
athelny
had
told
him
that
he
lived
in
a
house
built
by
inigo
jones
he
had
raved
as
he
raved
over
everything
over
the
balustrade
of
old
oak
and
when
he
came
down
to
open
the
door
for
philip
he
made
him
at
once
admire
the
elegant
carving
of
the
lintel
it
was
a
shabby
house
badly
needing
a
coat
of
paint
but
with
the
dignity
of
its
period
in
a
little
street
between
chancery
lane
and
holborn
which
had
once
been
fashionable
but
was
now
little
better
than
a
slum
there
was
a
plan
to
pull
it
down
in
order
to
put
up
handsome
offices
meanwhile
the
rents
were
small
and
athelny
was
able
to
get
the
two
upper
floors
at
a
price
which
suited
his
income
philip
had
not
seen
him
up
before
and
was
surprised
at
his
small
size
he
was
not
more
than
five
feet
and
five
inches
high
he
was
dressed
fantastically
in
blue
linen
trousers
of
the
sort
worn
by
working
men
in
france
and
a
very
old
brown
velvet
coat
he
wore
a
bright
red
sash
round
his
waist
a
low
collar
and
for
tie
a
flowing
bow
of
the
kind
used
by
the
comic
frenchman
in
the
pages
of
punch
he
greeted
philip
with
enthusiasm
he
began
talking
at
once
of
the
house
and
passed
his
hand
lovingly
over
the
balusters
look
at
it
feel
it
its
like
silk
what
a
miracle
of
grace
and
in
five
years
the
housebreaker
will
sell
it
for
firewood
he
insisted
on
taking
philip
into
a
room
on
the
first
floor
where
a
man
in
shirt
sleeves
a
blousy
woman
and
three
children
were
having
their
sunday
dinner
ive
just
brought
this
gentleman
in
to
show
him
your
ceiling
did
you
ever
see
anything
so
wonderful
how
are
you
mrs
hodgson
this
is
mr
carey
who
looked
after
me
when
i
was
in
the
hospital

the
man

athelnys

and
it
dont
matter
what
were
doing
if
were
in
bed
or
if
im
aving
a
wash
in
e
comes
philip
could
see
that
they
looked
upon
athelny
as
a
little
queer
but
they
liked
him
none
the
less
and
they
listened
openmouthed
while
he
discoursed
with
his
impetuous
fluency
on
the
beauty
of
the
seventeenthcentury
ceiling
what
a
crime
to
pull
this
down
eh
hodgson
youre
an
influential
citizen
why
dont
you
write
to
the
papers
and
protest
the
man
in
shirt
sleeves
gave
a
laugh
and
said
to
philip
mr
athelny
will
ave
his
little
joke
they
do
say
these
ouses
are
that
insanitory
its
not
safe
to
live
in
them
sanitation
be
damned
give
me
art
cried
athelny
ive
got
nine
children
and
they
thrive
on
bad
drains

not
going
to
take
any
risk
none
of
your
newfangled
notions
for
me
when
i
move
from
here
im
going
to
make
sure
the
drains
are
bad
before
i
take
anything
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
and
a
little
fairhaired
girl
opened
it
daddy
mummy
says
do
stop
talking
and
come
and
eat
your
dinner
this
is
my
third
daughter
said
athelny
pointing
to
her
with
a
dramatic
forefinger
she
is
called
maria
del
pilar
but
she
answers
more
willingly
to
the
name
of
jane
jane
your
nose
wants
blowing
i
havent
got
a
hanky
daddy
tut
tut
child
he
answered
as
he
produced
a
vast
brilliant
bandanna
what
do
you
suppose
the
almighty
gave
you
fingers
for
they
went
upstairs
and
philip
was
taken
into
a
room
with
walls
panelled
in
dark
oak
in
the
middle
was
a
narrow
table
of
teak
on
trestle
legs
with
two
supporting
bars
of
iron
of
the
kind
called
in
spain
mesa
de
hieraje
they
were
to
dine
there
for
two
places
were
laid
and
there
were
two
large
armchairs
with
broad
flat
arms
of
oak
and
leathern
backs
and
leathern
seats
they
were
severe
elegant
and
uncomfortable
the
only
other
piece
of
furniture
was
a
bargueno
elaborately
ornamented
with
gilt
ironwork
on
a
stand
of
ecclesiastical
design
roughly
but
very
finely
carved
there
stood
on
this
two
or
three
lustre
plates
much
broken
but
rich
in
colour
and
on
the
walls
were
old
masters
of
the
spanish
school
in
beautiful
though
dilapidated
frames
though
gruesome
in
subject
ruined
by
age
and
bad
treatment
and
secondrate
in
their
conception
they
had
a
glow
of
passion
there
was
nothing
in
the
room
of
any
value
but
the
effect
was
lovely
it
was
magnificent
and
yet
austere
philip
felt
that
it
offered
the
very
spirit
of
old
spain
athelny
was
in
the
middle
of
showing
him
the
inside
of
the
bargueno
with
its
beautiful
ornamentation
and

shyly
she
had
even
white
teeth
and

pleasant
gray

he
mustnt
eat
the
yorkshire
pudding
till
hes
shaken
the
hand
that
made
it
philip
followed
his
host
into
the
kitchen
it
was
small
and
much
overcrowded
there
had
been
a
lot
of
noise
but
it
stopped
as
soon
as
the
stranger
entered
there
was
a
large
table
in
the
middle
and
round
it
eager
for
dinner
were
seated
athelnys
children
a
woman
was
standing
at
the
oven
taking
out
baked
potatoes
one
by
one
heres
mr
carey
betty
said
athelny
fancy
bringing
him
in
here
what
will
he
think
she
wore
a
dirty
apron
and
the
sleeves
of
her
cotton
dress
were
turned
up
above
her
elbows
she
had
curling
pins
in
her
hair
mrs
athelny
was
a
large
woman
a
good
three
inches
taller
than
her
husband
fair
with
blue
eyes
and
a
kindly
expression
she
had
been
a
handsome
creature
but
advancing
years
and
the
bearing
of
many
children
had
made
her
fat
and
blousy
her
blue
eyes
had
become
pale
her
skin
was
coarse
and
red
the
colour
had
gone
out
of
her
hair
she
straightened
herself
wiped
her
hand
on
her
apron
and
held
it
out
youre
welcome
sir
she
said
in
a
slow
voice
with
an
accent
that
seemed
oddly
familiar
to
philip
athelny
said
you
was
very
kind
to
him
in
the
orspital
now
you
must
be
introduced
to
the
live
stock
said
athelny
that
is
thorpe
he
pointed
to
a
chubby
boy
with
curly
hair
he
is
my
eldest
son
heir
to
the
title
estates
and
responsibilities
of
the
family
there
is
athelstan
harold
edward
he
pointed
with
his
forefinger
to
three
smaller
boys
all
rosy
healthy
and
smiling
though
when
they
felt
philips
smiling
eyes
upon
them
they
looked
shyly
down
at
their
plates
now
the
girls
in
order
maria
del
sol
puddingface
said
one
of
the
small
boys
your
sense
of
humour
is
rudimentary
my
son
maria
de
los
mercedes
maria
del
pilar
maria
de
la
concepcion
maria
del
rosario
i
call
them
sally
molly
connie
rosie
and
jane
said
mrs
athelny
now
athelny
you
go
into
your
own
room
and
ill
send
you
your
dinner
ill
let
the
children
come
in
afterwards
for
a
bit
when
ive
washed
them
my
dear
if
id
had
the
naming
of
you
i
should
have
called
you
maria
of
the
soapsuds
youre
always
torturing
these
wretched
brats
with
soap
you
go
first
mr
carey
or
i
shall
never
get
him
to
sit
down
and
eat
his
dinner
athelny
and
philip
installed
themselves
in
the
great
monkish
chairs
and
sally
brought
them
in
two
plates
of
beef
yorkshire
pudding
baked
potatoes
and
cabbage
athelny
took
sixpence
out
of
his
pocket
and
sent
her
for
a
jug
of
beer
i
hope
you
didnt
have
the
table
laid
here
on
my
account
said
philip
i
should
have
been
quite
happy
to
eat
with
the
children
oh
no
i
always
have
my
meals
by
myself
i
like
these
antique
customs
i
dont
think
that
women
ought
to
sit
down
at
table
with
men
it
ruins
conversation
and
im
sure
its
very
bad
for
them
it
puts
ideas
in
their
heads
and
women
are
never
at
ease
with
themselves
when
they
have
ideas
both
host
and
guest
ate
with
a
hearty
appetite
did
you
ever
taste
such
yorkshire
pudding
no
one
can
make
it
like
my
wife
thats
the
advantage
of
not
marrying
a
lady
you
noticed
she
wasnt
a
lady
didnt
you
it
was
an
awkward
question
and
philip
did
not
know
how
to
answer
it
i
never
thought
about
it
he
said
lamely
athelny
laughed
he
had
a
peculiarly
joyous
laugh
no
shes
not
a
lady
nor
anything
like
it
her
father
was
a
farmer
and
shes
never
bothered
about
aitches
in
her
life
weve
had
twelve
children
and
nine
of
them
are
alive
i
tell
her
its
about
time
she
stopped
but
shes
an
obstinate
woman
shes
got
into
the
habit
of
it
now
and
i
dont
believe
shell
be
satisfied
till
shes
had
twenty
at
that
moment
sally
came
in
with
the
beer
and
having
poured
out
a
glass
for
philip
went
to
the
other
side
of
the
table
to
pour
some
out
for
her
father
he
put
his
hand
round
her
waist
did
you
ever
see
such
a
handsome
strapping
girl
only
fifteen
and
she
might
be
twenty
look
at
her
cheeks
shes
never
had
a
days
illness
in
her
life
itll
be
a
lucky
man
who
marries
her
wont
it
sally
sally
listened
to
all
this
with
a
slight
slow
smile
not
much
embarrassed
for
she
was
accustomed
to
her
fathers
outbursts
but
with
an
easy
modesty
which
was
very
attractive
dont
let
your
dinner
get
cold
father
she
said
drawing
herself
away
from
his
arm
youll
call
when
youre
ready
for
your
pudding
wont
you
they
were
left
alone
and
athelny
lifted
the
pewter
tankard
to
his
lips
he
drank
long
and
deep
my
word
is
there
anything
better
than
english
beer
he
said
let
us
thank
god
for
simple
pleasures
roast
beef
and
rice
pudding
a
good
appetite
and
beer
i
was
married
to
a
lady
once
my
god
dont
marry
a
lady
my
boy
philip
laughed
he
was
exhilarated
by
the
scene
the
funny
little
man
in
his
odd
clothes
the
panelled
room
and
the
spanish
furniture
the
english
fare
the
whole
thing
had
an
exquisite
incongruity
you
laugh
my
boy
you
cant
imagine
marrying
beneath
you
you
want
a
wife
whos
an
intellectual
equal
your
head
is
crammed
full
of
ideas
of
comradeship
stuff
and
nonsense
my
boy
a
man
doesnt
want
to
talk
politics
to
his
wife
and
what
do
you
think
i
care
for
bettys
views
upon
the
differential
calculus
a
man
wants
a
wife
who
can
cook
his
dinner
and
look
after
his
children
ive
tried
both
and
i
know
lets
have
the
pudding
in
he
clapped
his
hands
and
presently
sally
came
when
she
took
away
the
plates
philip
wanted
to
get
up
and
help
her
but
athelny
stopped
him
let
her
alone
my
boy
she
doesnt
want
you
to
fuss
about
do
you
sally
and
she
wont
think
it
rude
of
you
to
sit
still
while
she
waits
upon
you
she
dont
care
a
damn
for
chivalry
do
you
sally
no
father
answered
sally
demurely
do
you
know
what
im
talking
about
sally
no
father
but
you
know
mother
doesnt
like
you
to
swear
athelny
laughed
boisterously
sally
brought
them
plates
of
rice
pudding
rich
creamy
and
luscious
athelny
attacked
his
with
gusto
one
of
the
rules
of
this
house
is
that
sunday
dinner
should
never
alter
it
is
a
ritual
roast
beef
and
rice
pudding
for
fifty
sundays
in
the
year
on
easter
sunday
lamb
and
green
peas
and
at
michaelmas
roast
goose
and
apple
sauce
thus
we
preserve
the
traditions
of
our
people
when
sally
marries
she
will
forget
many
of
the
wise
things
i
have
taught
her
but
she
will
never
forget
that
if
you
want
to
be
good
and
happy
you
must
eat
on
sundays
roast
beef
and
rice
pudding
youll
call
when
youre
ready
for
cheese
said
sally
impassively
dyou
know
the
legend
of
the
halcyon
said
athelny
philip
was
growing
used
to
his
rapid
leaping
from
one
subject
to
another
when
the
kingfisher
flying
over
the
sea
is
exhausted
his
mate
places
herself
beneath
him
and
bears
him
along
upon
her
stronger
wings
that
is
what
a
man
wants
in
a
wife
the
halcyon
i
lived
with
my
first
wife
for
three
years
she
was
a
lady
she
had
fifteen
hundred
a
year
and
we
used
to
give
nice
little
dinner
parties
in
our
little
red
brick
house
in
kensington
she
was
a
charming
woman
they
all
said
so
the
barristers
and
their
wives
who
dined
with
us
and
the
literary
stockbrokers
and
the
budding
politicians
oh
she
was
a
charming
woman
she
made
me
go
to
church
in
a
silk
hat
and
a
frock
coat
she
took
me
to
classical
concerts
and
she
was
very
fond
of
lectures
on
sunday
afternoon
and
she
sat
down
to
breakfast
every
morning
at
eightthirty
and
if
i
was
late
breakfast
was
cold
and
she
read
the
right
books
admired
the
right
pictures
and
adored
the
right
music
my
god
how
that
woman
bored
me
she
is
charming
still
and
she
lives
in
the
little
red
brick
house
in
kensington
with
morris
papers
and
whistlers
etchings
on
the
walls
and
gives
the
same
nice
little
dinner
parties
with
veal
creams
and
ices
from
gunters
as
she
did
twenty
years
ago
philip
did
not
ask
by
what
means
the
illmatched
couple
had
separated
but
athelny
told
him
bettys
not
my
wife
you
know
my
wife
wouldnt
divorce
me
the
children
are
bastards
every
jack
one
of
them
and
are
they
any
the
worse
for
that
betty
was
one
of
the
maids
in
the
little
red
brick
house
in
kensington
four
or
five
years
ago
i
was
on
my
uppers
and
i
had
seven
children
and
i
went
to
my
wife
and
asked
her
to
help
me
she
said
shed
make
me
an
allowance
if
id
give
betty
up
and
go
abroad
can
you
see
me
giving
betty
up
we
starved
for
a
while
instead
my
wife
said
i
loved
the
gutter
ive
degenerated
ive
come
down
in
the
world
i
earn
three
pounds
a
week
as
press
agent
to
a
linendraper
and
every
day
i
thank
god
that
im
not
in
the
little
red
brick
house
in
kensington
sally
brought
in
cheddar
cheese
and
athelny
went
on
with
his
fluent
conversation
its
the
greatest
mistake
in
the
world
to
think
that
one
needs
money
to
bring
up
a
family
you
need
money
to
make
them
gentlemen
and
ladies
but
i
dont
want
my
children
to
be
ladies
and
gentlemen
sallys
going
to
earn
her
living
in
another
year
shes
to
be
apprenticed
to
a
dressmaker
arent
you
sally
and
the
boys
are
going
to
serve
their
country
i
want
them
all
to
go
into
the
navy
its
a
jolly
life
and
a
healthy
life
good
food
good
pay
and
a
pension
to
end
their
days
on
philip
lit
his
pipe
athelny
smoked
cigarettes
of
havana
tobacco
which
he
rolled
himself
sally
cleared
away
philip
was
reserved
and
it
embarrassed
him
to
be
the
recipient
of
so
many
confidences
athelny
with
his
powerful
voice
in
the
diminutive
body
with
his
bombast
with
his
foreign
look
with
his
emphasis
was
an
astonishing
creature
he
reminded
philip
a
good
deal
of
cronshaw
he
appeared
to
have
the
same
independence
of
thought
the
same
bohemianism
but
he
had
an
infinitely
more
vivacious
temperament
his
mind
was
coarser
and
he
had
not
that
interest
in
the
abstract
which
made
cronshaws
conversation
so
captivating
athelny
was
very
proud
of
the
county
family
to
which
he
belonged
he
showed
philip
photographs
of
an
elizabethan
mansion
and
told
him
the
athelnys
have
lived
there
for
seven
centuries
my
boy
ah
if
you
saw
the
chimneypieces
and
the
ceilings
there
was
a
cupboard
in
the
wainscoting
and
from
this
he
took
a
family
tree
he
showed
it
to
philip
with
childlike
satisfaction
it
was
indeed
imposing
you
see
how
the
family
names
recur
thorpe
athelstan
harold
edward
ive
used
the
family
names
for
my
sons
and
the
girls
you
see
ive
given
spanish
names
to
an
uneasy
feeling
came
to
philip
that
possibly
the
whole
story
was
an
elaborate
imposture
not
told
with
any
base
motive
but
merely
from
a
wish
to
impress
startle
and
amaze
athelny
had
told
him
that
he
was
at
winchester
but
philip
sensitive
to
differences
of
manner
did
not
feel
that
his
host
had
the
characteristics
of
a
man
educated
at
a
great
public
school
while
he
pointed
out
the
great
alliances
which
his
ancestors
had
formed
philip
amused
himself
by
wondering
whether
athelny
was
not
the
son
of
some
tradesman
in
winchester
auctioneer
or
coalmerchant
and
whether
a
similarity
of
surname
was
not
his
only
connection
with
the
ancient
family
whose
tree
he
was
displaying
chapter
lxxxviii
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
and
a
troop
of
children
came
in
they
were
clean
and
tidy
now
their
faces
shone
with
soap
and
their
hair
was
plastered
down
they
were
going
to
sunday
school
under
sallys
charge
athelny
joked
with
them
in
his
dramatic
exuberant
fashion
and
you
could
see
that
he
was
devoted
to
them
all
his
pride
in
their
good
health
and
their
good
looks
was
touching
philip
felt
that
they
were
a
little
shy
in
his
presence
and
when
their
father
sent
them
off
they
fled
from
the
room
in
evident
relief
in
a
few
minutes
mrs
athelny
appeared
she
had
taken
her
hair
out
of
the
curling
pins
and
now
wore
an
elaborate
fringe
she
had
on
a
plain
black
dress
a
hat
with
cheap
flowers
and
was
forcing
her
hands
red
and
coarse
from
much
work
into
black
kid
gloves
im
going
to
church
athelny
she
said
theres
nothing
youll
be
wanting
is
there
only
your
prayers
my
betty
they
wont
do
you
much
good
youre
too
far
gone
for
that
she
smiled
then
turning
to
philip
she
drawled
i
cant
get
him
to
go
to
church
hes
no
better
than
an
atheist
doesnt
she
look
like
rubens
second
wife
cried
athelny
wouldnt
she
look
splendid
in
a
seventeenthcentury
costume
thats
the
sort
of
wife
to
marry
my
boy
look
at
her
i
believe
youd
talk
the
hind
leg
off
a
donkey
athelny
she
answered
calmly
she
succeeded
in
buttoning
her
gloves
but
before
she
went
she
turned
to
philip
with
a
kindly
slightly
embarrassed
smile
youll
stay
to
tea
wont
you
athelny
likes
someone
to
talk
to
and
its
not
often
he
gets
anybody
whos
clever
enough
of
course
hell
stay
to
tea
said
athelny
then
when
his
wife
had
gone
i
make
a
point
of
the
children
going
to
sunday
school
and
i
like
betty
to
go
to
church
i
think
women
ought
to
be
religious
i
dont
believe
myself
but
i
like
women
and
children
to
philip
straitlaced
in
matters
of
truth
was
a
little
shocked
by
this
airy
attitude
but
how
can
you
look
on
while
your
children
are
being
taught
things
which
you
dont
think
are
true
if
theyre
beautiful
i
dont
much
mind
if
theyre
not
true
its
asking
a
great
deal
that
things
should
appeal
to
your
reason
as
well
as
to
your
sense
of
the
aesthetic
i
wanted
betty
to
become
a
roman
catholic
i
should
have
liked
to
see
her
converted
in
a
crown
of
paper
flowers
but
shes
hopelessly
protestant
besides
religion
is
a
matter
of
temperament
you
will
believe
anything
if
you
have
the
religious
turn
of
mind
and
if
you
havent
it
doesnt
matter
what
beliefs
were
instilled
into
you
you
will
grow
out
of
them
perhaps
religion
is
the
best
school
of
morality
it
is
like
one
of
those
drugs
you
gentlemen
use
in
medicine
which
carries
another
in
solution
it
is
of
no
efficacy
in
itself
but
enables
the
other
to
be
absorbed
you
take
your
morality
because
it
is
combined
with
religion
you
lose
the
religion
and
the
morality
stays
behind
a
man
is
more
likely
to
be
a
good
man
if
he
has
learned
goodness
through
the
love
of
god
than
through
a
perusal
of
herbert
spencer
this
was
contrary
to
all
philips
ideas
he
still
looked
upon
christianity
as
a
degrading
bondage
that
must
be
cast
away
at
any
cost
it
was
connected
subconsciously
in
his
mind
with
the
dreary
services
in
the
cathedral
at
tercanbury
and
the
long
hours
of
boredom
in
the
cold
church
at
blackstable
and
the
morality
of
which
athelny
spoke
was
to
him
no
more
than
a
part
of
the
religion
which
a
halting
intelligence
preserved
when
it
had
laid
aside
the
beliefs
which
alone
made
it
reasonable
but
while
he
was
meditating
a
reply
athelny
more
interested
in
hearing
himself
speak
than
in
discussion
broke
into
a
tirade
upon
roman
catholicism
for
him
it
was
an
essential
part
of
spain
and
spain
meant
much
to
him
because
he
had
escaped
to
it
from
the
conventionality
which
during
his
married
life
he
had
found
so
irksome
with
large
gestures
and
in
the
emphatic
tone
which
made
what
he
said
so
striking
athelny
described
to
philip
the
spanish
cathedrals
with
their
vast
dark
spaces
the
massive
gold
of
the
altarpieces
and
the
sumptuous
ironwork
gilt
and
faded
the
air
laden
with
incense
the
silence
philip
almost
saw
the
canons
in
their
short
surplices
of
lawn
the
acolytes
in
red
passing
from
the
sacristy
to
the
choir
he
almost
heard
the
monotonous
chanting
of
vespers
the
names
which
athelny
mentioned
avila
tarragona
saragossa
segovia
cordova
were
like
trumpets
in
his
heart
he
seemed
to
see
the
great
gray
piles
of
granite
set
in
old
spanish
towns
amid
a
landscape
tawny
wild
and
windswept
ive
always
thought
i
should
love
to
go
to
seville
he
said
casually
when
athelny
with
one
hand
dramatically
uplifted
paused
for
a
moment
seville
cried
athelny
no
no
dont
go
there
seville
it
brings
to
the
mind
girls
dancing
with
castanets
singing
in
gardens
by
the
guadalquivir
bullfights
orangeblossom
mantillas
mantones
de
manila
it
is
the
spain
of
comic
opera
and
montmartre
its
facile
charm
can
offer
permanent
entertainment
only
to
an
intelligence
which
is
superficial
theophile
gautier
got
out
of
seville
all
that
it
has
to
offer
we
who
come
after
him
can
only
repeat
his
sensations
he
put
large
fat
hands
on
the
obvious
and
there
is
nothing
but
the
obvious
there
and
it
is
all
fingermarked
and
frayed
murillo
is
its
painter
athelny
got
up
from
his
chair
walked
over
to
the
spanish
cabinet
let
down
the
front
with
its
great
gilt
hinges
and
gorgeous
lock
and
displayed
a
series
of
little
drawers
he
took
out
a
bundle
of
photographs
do
you
know
el
greco
he
asked
oh
i
remember
one
of
the
men
in
paris
was
awfully
impressed
by
him
el
greco
was
the
painter
of
toledo
betty
couldnt
find
the
photograph
i
wanted
to
show
you
its
a
picture
that
el
greco
painted
of
the
city
he
loved
and
its
truer
than
any
photograph
come
and
sit
at
the
table
philip
dragged
his
chair
forward
and
athelny
set
the
photograph
before
him
he
looked
at
it
curiously
for
a
long
time
in
silence
he
stretched
out
his
hand
for
other
photographs
and
athelny
passed
them
to
him
he
had
never
before
seen
the
work
of
that
enigmatic
master
and
at
the
first
glance
he
was
bothered
by
the
arbitrary
drawing
the
figures
were
extraordinarily
elongated
the
heads
were
very
small
the
attitudes
were
extravagant
this
was
not
realism
and
yet
and
yet
even
in
the
photographs
you
had
the
impression
of
a
troubling
reality
athelny
was
describing
eagerly
with
vivid
phrases
but
philip
only
heard
vaguely
what
he
said
he
was
puzzled
he
was
curiously
moved
these
pictures
seemed
to
offer
some
meaning
to
him
but
he
did
not
know
what
the
meaning
was
there
were
portraits
of
men
with
large
melancholy
eyes
which
seemed
to
say
you
knew
not
what
there
were
long
monks
in
the
franciscan
habit
or
in
the
dominican
with
distraught
faces
making
gestures
whose
sense
escaped
you
there
was
an
assumption
of
the
virgin
there
was
a
crucifixion
in
which
the
painter
by
some
magic
of
feeling
had
been
able
to
suggest
that
the
flesh
of
christs
dead
body
was
not
human
flesh
only
but
divine
and
there
was
an
ascension
in
which
the
saviour
seemed
to
surge
up
towards
the
empyrean
and
yet
to
stand
upon
the
air
as
steadily
as
though
it
were
solid
ground
the
uplifted
arms
of
the
apostles
the
sweep
of
their
draperies
their
ecstatic
gestures
gave
an
impression
of
exultation
and
of
holy
joy
the
background
of
nearly
all
was
the
sky
by
night
the
dark
night
of
the
soul
with
wild
clouds
swept
by
strange
winds
of
hell
and
lit
luridly
by
an
uneasy
moon
ive
seen
that
sky
in
toledo
over
and
over
again
said
athelny
i
have
an
idea
that
when
first
el
greco
came
to
the
city
it
was
by
such
a
night
and
it
made
so
vehement
an
impression
upon
him
that
he
could
never
get
away
from
it
philip
remembered
how
clutton
had
been
affected
by
this
strange
master
whose
work
he
now
saw
for
the
first
time
he
thought
that
clutton
was
the
most
interesting
of
all
the
people
he
had
known
in
paris
his
sardonic
manner
his
hostile
aloofness
had
made
it
difficult
to
know
him
but
it
seemed
to
philip
looking
back
that
there
had
been
in
him
a
tragic
force
which
sought
vainly
to
express
itself
in
painting
he
was
a
man
of
unusual
character
mystical
after
the
fashion
of
a
time
that
had
no
leaning
to
mysticism
who
was
impatient
with
life
because
he
found
himself
unable
to
say
the
things
which
the
obscure
impulses
of
his
heart
suggested
his
intellect
was
not
fashioned
to
the
uses
of
the
spirit
it
was
not
surprising
that
he
felt
a
deep
sympathy
with
the
greek
who
had
devised
a
new
technique
to
express
the
yearnings
of
his
soul
philip
looked
again
at
the
series
of
portraits
of
spanish
gentlemen
with
ruffles
and
pointed
beards
their
faces
pale
against
the
sober
black
of
their
clothes
and
the
darkness
of
the
background
el
greco
was
the
painter
of
the
soul
and
these
gentlemen
wan
and
wasted
not
by
exhaustion
but
by
restraint
with
their
tortured
minds
seem
to
walk
unaware
of
the
beauty
of
the
world
for
their
eyes
look
only
in
their
hearts
and
they
are
dazzled
by
the
glory
of
the
unseen
no
painter
has
shown
more
pitilessly
that
the
world
is
but
a
place
of
passage
the
souls
of
the
men
he
painted
speak
their
strange
longings
through
their
eyes
their
senses
are
miraculously
acute
not
for
sounds
and
odours
and
colour
but
for
the
very
subtle
sensations
of
the
soul
the
noble
walks
with
the
monkish
heart
within
him
and
his
eyes
see
things
which
saints
in
their
cells
see
too
and
he
is
unastounded
his
lips
are
not
lips
that
smile
philip
silent
still
returned
to
the
photograph
of
toledo
which
seemed
to
him
the
most
arresting
picture
of
them
all
he
could
not
take
his
eyes
off
it
he
felt
strangely
that
he
was
on
the
threshold
of
some
new
discovery
in
life
he
was
tremulous
with
a
sense
of
adventure
he
thought
for
an
instant
of
the
love
that
had
consumed
him
love
seemed
very
trivial
beside
the
excitement
which
now
leaped
in
his
heart
the
picture
he
looked
at
was
a
long
one
with
houses
crowded
upon
a
hill
in
one
corner
a
boy
was
holding
a
large
map
of
the
town
in
another
was
a
classical
figure
representing
the
river
tagus
and
in
the
sky
was
the
virgin
surrounded
by
angels
it
was
a
landscape
alien
to
all
philips
notion
for
he
had
lived
in
circles
that
worshipped
exact
realism
and
yet
here
again
strangely
to
himself
he
felt
a
reality
greater
than
any
achieved
by
the
masters
in
whose
steps
humbly
he
had
sought
to
walk
he
heard
athelny
say
that
the
representation
was
so
precise
that
when
the
citizens
of
toledo
came
to
look
at
the
picture
they
recognised
their
houses
the
painter
had
painted
exactly
what
he
saw
but
he
had
seen
with
the
eyes
of
the
spirit
there
was
something
unearthly
in
that
city
of
pale
gray
it
was
a
city
of
the
soul
seen
by
a
wan
light
that
was
neither
that
of
night
nor
day
it
stood
on
a
green
hill
but
of
a
green
not
of
this
world
and
it
was
surrounded
by
massive
walls
and
bastions
to
be
stormed
by
no
machines
or
engines
of
mans
invention
but
by
prayer
and
fasting
by
contrite
sighs
and
by
mortifications
of
the
flesh
it
was
a
stronghold
of
god
those
gray
houses
were
made
of
no
stone
known
to
masons
there
was
something
terrifying
in
their
aspect
and
you
did
not
know
what
men
might
live
in
them
you
might
walk
through
the
streets
and
be
unamazed
to
find
them
all
deserted
and
yet
not
empty
for
you
felt
a
presence
invisible
and
yet
manifest
to
every
inner
sense
it
was
a
mystical
city
in
which
the
imagination
faltered
like
one
who
steps
out
of
the
light
into
darkness
the
soul
walked
naked
to
and
fro
knowing
the
unknowable
and
conscious
strangely
of
experience
intimate
but
inexpressible
of
the
absolute
and
without
surprise
in
that
blue
sky
real
with
a
reality
that
not
the
eye
but
the
soul
confesses
with
its
rack
of
light
clouds
driven
by
strange
breezes
like
the
cries
and
the
sighs
of
lost
souls
you
saw
the
blessed
virgin
with
a
gown
of
red
and
a
cloak
of
blue
surrounded
by
winged
angels
philip
felt
that
the
inhabitants
of
that
city
would
have
seen
the
apparition
without
astonishment
reverent
and
thankful
and
have
gone
their
ways
athelny
spoke
of
the
mystical
writers
of
spain
of
teresa
de
avila
san
juan
de
la
cruz
fray
luis
de
leon
in
all
of
them
was
that
passion
for
the
unseen
which
philip
felt
in
the
pictures
of
el
greco
they
seemed
to
have
the
power
to
touch
the
incorporeal
and
see
the
invisible
they
were
spaniards
of
their
age
in
whom
were
tremulous
all
the
mighty
exploits
of
a
great
nation
their
fancies
were
rich
with
the
glories
of
america
and
the
green
islands
of
the
caribbean
sea
in
their
veins
was
the
power
that
had
come
from
agelong
battling
with
the
moor
they
were
proud
for
they
were
masters
of
the
world
and
they
felt
in
themselves
the
wide
distances
the
tawny
wastes
the
snowcapped
mountains
of
castile
the
sunshine
and
the
blue
sky
and
the
flowering
plains
of
andalusia
life
was
passionate
and
manifold
and
because
it
offered
so
much
they
felt
a
restless
yearning
for
something
more
because
they
were
human
they
were
unsatisfied
and
they
threw
this
eager
vitality
of
theirs
into
a
vehement
striving
after
the
ineffable
athelny
was
not
displeased
to
find
someone
to
whom
he
could
read
the
translations
with
which
for
some
time
he
had
amused
his
leisure
and
in
his
fine
vibrating
voice
he
recited
the
canticle
of
the
soul
and
christ
her
lover
the
lovely
poem
which
begins
with
the
words
en
una
noche
oscura
and
the
noche
serena
of
fray
luis
de
leon
he
had
translated
them
quite
simply
not
without
skill
and
he
had
found
words
which
at
all
events
suggested
the
roughhewn
grandeur
of
the
original
the
pictures
of
el
greco
explained
them
and
they
explained
the
pictures
philip
had
cultivated
a
certain
disdain
for
idealism
he
had
always
had
a
passion
for
life
and
the
idealism
he
had
come
across
seemed
to
him
for
the
most
part
a
cowardly
shrinking
from
it
the
idealist
withdrew
himself
because
he
could
not
suffer
the
jostling
of
the
human
crowd
he
had
not
the
strength
to
fight
and
so
called
the
battle
vulgar
he
was
vain
and
since
his
fellows
would
not
take
him
at
his
own
estimate
consoled
himself
with
despising
his
fellows
for
philip
his
type
was
hayward
fair
languid
too
fat
now
and
rather
bald
still
cherishing
the
remains
of
his
good
looks
and
still
delicately
proposing
to
do
exquisite
things
in
the
uncertain
future
and
at
the
back
of
this
were
whiskey
and
vulgar
amours
of
the
street
it
was
in
reaction
from
what
hayward
represented
that
philip
clamoured
for
life
as
it
stood
sordidness
vice
deformity
did
not
offend
him
he
declared
that
he
wanted
man
in
his
nakedness
and
he
rubbed
his
hands
when
an
instance
came
before
him
of
meanness
cruelty
selfishness
or
lust
that
was
the
real
thing
in
paris
he
had
learned
that
there
was
neither
ugliness
nor
beauty
but
only
truth
the
search
after
beauty
was
sentimental
had
he
not
painted
an
advertisement
of
chocolat
menier
in
a
landscape
in
order
to
escape
from
the
tyranny
of
prettiness
but
here
he
seemed
to
divine
something
new
he
had
been
coming
to
it
all
hesitating
for
some
time
but
only
now
was
conscious
of
the
fact
he
felt
himself
on
the
brink
of
a
discovery
he
felt
vaguely
that
here
was
something
better
than
the
realism
which
he
had
adored
but
certainly
it
was
not
the
bloodless
idealism
which
stepped
aside
from
life
in
weakness
it
was
too
strong
it
was
virile
it
accepted
life
in
all
its
vivacity
ugliness
and
beauty
squalor
and
heroism
it
was
realism
still
but
it
was
realism
carried
to
some
higher
pitch
in
which
facts
were
transformed
by
the
more
vivid
light
in
which
they
were
seen
he
seemed
to
see
things
more
profoundly
through
the
grave
eyes
of
those
dead
noblemen
of
castile
and
the
gestures
of
the
saints
which
at
first
had
seemed
wild
and
distorted
appeared
to
have
some
mysterious
significance
but
he
could
not
tell
what
that
significance
was
it
was
like
a
message
which
it
was
very
important
for
him
to
receive
but
it
was
given
him
in
an
unknown
tongue
and
he
could
not
understand
he
was
always
seeking
for
a
meaning
in
life
and
here
it
seemed
to
him
that
a
meaning
was
offered
but
it
was
obscure
and
vague
he
was
profoundly
troubled
he
saw
what
looked
like
the
truth
as
by
flashes
of
lightning
on
a
dark
stormy
night
you
might
see
a
mountain
range
he
seemed
to
see
that
a
man
need
not
leave
his
life
to
chance
but
that
his
will
was
powerful
he
seemed
to
see
that
selfcontrol
might
be
as
passionate
and
as
active
as
the
surrender
to
passion
he
seemed
to
see
that
the
inward
life
might
be
as
manifold
as
varied
as
rich
with
experience
as
the
life
of
one
who
conquered
realms
and
explored
unknown
lands
chapter
lxxxix
the
conversation
between
philip
and
athelny
was
broken
into
by
a
clatter
up
the
stairs
athelny
opened
the
door
for
the
children
coming
back
from
sunday
school
and
with
laughter
and
shouting
they
came
in
gaily
he
asked
them
what
they
had
learned
sally
appeared
for
a
moment
with
instructions
from
her
mother
that
father
was
to
amuse
the
children
while
she
got
tea
ready
and
athelny
began
to
tell
them
one
of
hans
andersens
stories
they
were
not
shy
children
and
they
quickly
came
to
the
conclusion
that
philip
was
not
formidable
jane
came
and
stood
by
him
and
presently
settled
herself
on
his
knees
it
was
the
first
time
that
philip
in
his
lonely
life
had
been
present
in
a
family
circle
his
eyes
smiled
as
they
rested
on
the
fair
children
engrossed
in
the
fairy
tale
the
life
of
his
new
friend
eccentric
as
it
appeared
at
first
glance
seemed
now
to
have
the
beauty
of
perfect
naturalness
sally
came
in
once
more
now
then
children
teas
ready
she
said
jane
slipped
off
philips
knees
and
they
all
went
back
to
the
kitchen
sally
began
to
lay
the
cloth
on
the
long
spanish
table
mother
says
shall
she
come
and
have
tea
with
you
she
asked
i
can
give
the
children
their
tea
tell
your
mother
that
we
shall
be
proud
and
honoured
if
she
will
favour
us
with
her
company
said
athelny
it
seemed
to
philip
that
he
could
never
say
anything
without
an
oratorical
flourish
then
ill
lay
for
her
said
sally
she
came
back
again
in
a
moment
with
a
tray
on
which
were
a
cottage
loaf
a
slab
of
butter
and
a
jar
of
strawberry
jam
while
she
placed
the
things
on
the
table
her
father
chaffed
her
he
said
it
was
quite
time
she
was
walking
out
he
told
philip
that
she
was
very
proud
and
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
aspirants
to
that
honour
who
lined
up
at
the
door
two
by
two
outside
the
sunday
school
and
craved
the
honour
of
escorting
her
home
you
do
talk
father
said
sally
with
her
slow
goodnatured
smile
you
wouldnt
think
to
look
at
her
that
a
tailors
assistant
has
enlisted
in
the
army
because
she
would
not
say
how
dyou
do
to
him
and
an
electrical
engineer
an
electrical
engineer
mind
you
has
taken
to
drink
because
she
refused
to
share
her
hymnbook
with
him
in
church
i
shudder
to
think
what
will
happen
when
she
puts
her
hair
up
motherll
bring
the
tea
along
herself
said
sally
sally
never
pays
any
attention
to
me
laughed
athelny
looking
at
her
with
fond
proud
eyes
she
goes
about
her
business
indifferent
to
wars
revolutions
and
cataclysms
what
a
wife
shell
make
to
an
honest
man
mrs
athelny
brought
in
the
tea
she
sat
down
and
proceeded
to
cut
bread
and
butter
it
amused
philip
to
see
that
she
treated
her
husband
as
though
he
were
a
child
she
spread
jam
for
him
and
cut
up
the
bread
and
butter
into
convenient
slices
for
him
to
eat
she
had
taken
off
her
hat
and
in
her
sunday
dress
which
seemed
a
little
tight
for
her
she
looked
like
one
of
the
farmers
wives
whom
philip
used
to
call
on
sometimes
with
his
uncle
when
he
was
a
small
boy
then
he
knew
why
the
sound
of
her
voice
was
familiar
to
him
she
spoke
just
like
the
people
round
blackstable
what
part
of
the
country
dyou
come
from
he
asked
her
im
a
kentish
woman
i
come
from
ferne
i
thought
as
much
my
uncles
vicar
of
blackstable
thats
a
funny
thing
now
she
said
i
was
wondering
in
church
just
now
whether
you
was
any
connection
of
mr
carey
manys
the
time
ive
seen
im
a
cousin
of
mine
married
mr
barker
of
roxley
farm
over
by
blackstable
church
and
i
used
to
go
and
stay
there
often
when
i
was
a
girl
isnt
that
a
funny
thing
now
she
looked
at
him
with
a
new
interest
and
a
brightness
came
into
her
faded
eyes
she
asked
him
whether
he
knew
ferne
it
was
a
pretty
village
about
ten
miles
across
country
from
blackstable
and
the
vicar
had
come
over
sometimes
to
blackstable
for
the
harvest
thanksgiving
she
mentioned
names
of
various
farmers
in
the
neighbourhood
she
was
delighted
to
talk
again
of
the
country
in
which
her
youth
was
spent
and
it
was
a
pleasure
to
her
to
recall
scenes
and
people
that
had
remained
in
her
memory
with
the
tenacity
peculiar
to
her
class
it
gave
philip
a
queer
sensation
too
a
breath
of
the
countryside
seemed
to
be
wafted
into
that
panelled
room
in
the
middle
of
london
he
seemed
to
see
the
fat
kentish
fields
with
their
stately
elms
and
his
nostrils
dilated
with
the
scent
of
the
air
it
is
laden
with
the
salt
of
the
north
sea
and
that
makes
it
keen
and
sharp
philip
did
not
leave
the
athelnys
till
ten
oclock
the
children
came
in
to
say
goodnight
at
eight
and
quite
naturally
put
up
their
faces
for
philip
to
kiss
his
heart
went
out
to
them
sally
only
held
out
her
hand
sally
never
kisses
gentlemen
till
shes
seen
them
twice
said
her
father
you
must
ask
me
again
then
said
philip
you
mustnt
take
any
notice
of
what
father
says
remarked
sally
with
a
smile
shes
a
most
selfpossessed
young
woman
added
her
parent
they
had
supper
of
bread
and
cheese
and
beer
while
mrs
athelny
was
putting
the
children
to
bed
and
when
philip
went
into
the
kitchen
to
bid
her
goodnight
she
had
been
sitting
there
resting
herself
and
reading
the
weekly
despatch
she
invited
him
cordially
to
come
again
theres
always
a
good
dinner
on
sundays
so
long
as
athelnys
in
work
she
said
and
its
a
charity
to
come
and
talk
to
him
on
the
following
saturday
philip
received
a
postcard
from
athelny
saying
that
they
were
expecting
him
to
dinner
next
day
but
fearing
their
means
were
not
such
that
mr
athelny
would
desire
him
to
accept
philip
wrote
back
that
he
would
only
come
to
tea
he
bought
a
large
plum
cake
so
that
his
entertainment
should
cost
nothing
he
found
the
whole
family
glad
to
see
him
and
the
cake
completed
his
conquest
of
the
children
he
insisted
that
they
should
all
have
tea
together
in
the
kitchen
and
the
meal
was
noisy
and
hilarious
soon
philip
got
into
the
habit
of
going
to
athelnys
every
sunday
he
became
a
great
favourite
with
the
children
because
he
was
simple
and
unaffected
and
because
it
was
so
plain
that
he
was
fond
of
them
as
soon
as
they
heard
his
ring
at
the
door
one
of
them
popped
a
head
out
of
window
to
make
sure
it
was
he
and
then
they
all
rushed
downstairs
tumultuously
to
let
him
in
they
flung
themselves
into
his
arms
at
tea
they
fought
for
the
privilege
of
sitting
next
to
him
soon
they
began
to
call
him
uncle
philip
athelny
was
very
communicative
and
little
by
little
philip
learned
the
various
stages
of
his
life
he
had
followed
many
occupations
and
it
occurred
to
philip
that
he
managed
to
make
a
mess
of
everything
he
attempted
he
had
been
on
a
tea
plantation
in
ceylon
and
a
traveller
in
america
for
italian
wines
his
secretaryship
of
the
water
company
in
toledo
had
lasted
longer
than
any
of
his
employments
he
had
been
a
journalist
and
for
some
time
had
worked
as
policecourt
reporter
for
an
evening
paper
he
had
been
subeditor
of
a
paper
in
the
midlands
and
editor
of
another
on
the
riviera
from
all
his
occupations
he
had
gathered
amusing
anecdotes
which
he
told
with
a
keen
pleasure
in
his
own
powers
of
entertainment
he
had
read
a
great
deal
chiefly
delighting
in
books
which
were
unusual
and
he
poured
forth
his
stores
of
abstruse
knowledge
with
childlike
enjoyment
of
the
amazement
of
his
hearers
three
or
four
years
before
abject
poverty
had
driven
him
to
take
the
job
of
pressrepresentative
to
a
large
firm
of
drapers
and
though
he
felt
the
work
unworthy
his
abilities
which
he
rated
highly
the
firmness
of
his
wife
and
the
needs
of
his
family
had
made
him
stick
to
it
chapter
xc
when
he
left
the
athelnys
philip
walked
down
chancery
lane
and
along
the
strand
to
get
a
bus
at
the
top
of
parliament
street
one
sunday
when
he
had
known
them
about
six
weeks
he
did
this
as
usual
but
he
found
the
kennington
bus
full
it
was
june
but
it
had
rained
during
the
day
and
the
night
was
raw
and
cold
he
walked
up
to
piccadilly
circus
in
order
to
get
a
seat
the
bus
waited
at
the
fountain
and
when
it
arrived
there
seldom
had
more
than
two
or
three
people
in
it
this
service
ran
every
quarter
of
an
hour
and
he
had
some
time
to
wait
he
looked
idly
at
the
crowd
the
publichouses
were
closing
and
there
were
many
people
about
his
mind
was
busy
with
the
ideas
athelny
had
the
charming
gift
of
suggesting
suddenly
his
heart
stood
still
he
saw
mildred
he
had
not
thought
of
her
for
weeks
she
was
crossing
over
from
the
corner
of
shaftesbury
avenue
and
stopped
at
the
shelter
till
a
string
of
cabs
passed
by
she
was
watching
her
opportunity
and
had
no
eyes
for
anything
else
she
wore
a
large
black
straw
hat
with
a
mass
of
feathers
on
it
and
a
black
silk
dress
at
that
time
it
was
fashionable
for
women
to
wear
trains
the
road
was
clear
and
mildred
crossed
her
skirt
trailing
on
the
ground
and
walked
down
piccadilly
philip
his
heart
beating
excitedly
followed
her
he
did
not
wish
to
speak
to
her
but
he
wondered
where
she
was
going
at
that
hour
he
wanted
to
get
a
look
at
her
face
she
walked
slowly
along
and
turned
down
air
street
and
so
got
through
into
regent
street
she
walked
up
again
towards
the
circus
philip
was
puzzled
he
could
not
make
out
what
she
was
doing
perhaps
she
was
waiting
for
somebody
and
he
felt
a
great
curiosity
to
know
who
it
was
she
overtook
a
short
man
in
a
bowler
hat
who
was
strolling
very
slowly
in
the
same
direction
as
herself
she
gave
him
a
sidelong
glance
as
she
passed
she
walked
a
few
steps
more
till
she
came
to
swan
and
edgars
then
stopped
and
waited
facing
the
road
when
the
man
came
up
she
smiled
the
man
stared
at
her
for
a
moment
turned
away
his
head
and
sauntered
on
then
philip
understood
he
was
overwhelmed
with
horror
for
a
moment
he
felt
such
a
weakness
in
his
legs
that
he
could
hardly
stand
then
he
walked
after
her
quickly
he
touched
her
on
the
arm
mildred
she
turned
round
with
a
violent
start
he
thought
that
she
reddened
but
in
the
obscurity
he
could
not
see
very
well
for
a
while
they
stood
and
looked
at
one
another
without
speaking
at
last
she
said
fancy
seeing
you
he
did
not
know
what
to
answer
he
was
horribly
shaken
and
the
phrases
that
chased
one
another
through
his
brain
seemed
incredibly
melodramatic
its
awful
he
gasped
almost
to
himself
she
did
not
say
anything
more
she
turned
away
from
him
and
looked
down
at
the
pavement
he
felt
that
his
face
was
distorted
with
misery
isnt
there
anywhere
we
can
go
and
talk
i
dont
want
to
talk
she
said
sullenly
leave
me
alone
cant
you
the
thought
struck
him
that
perhaps
she
was
in
urgent
need
of
money
and
could
not
afford
to
go
away
at
that
hour
ive
got
a
couple
of
sovereigns
on
me
if
youre
hard
up
he
blurted
out
i
dont
know
what
you
mean
i
was
just
walking
along
here
on
my
way
back
to
my
lodgings
i
expected
to
meet
one
of
the
girls
from
where
i
work
for
gods
sake
dont
lie
now
he
said
then
he
saw
that
she
was
crying
and
he
repeated
his
question
cant
we
go
and
talk
somewhere
cant
i
come
back
to
your
rooms
no
you
cant
do
that
she
sobbed
im
not
allowed
to
take
gentlemen
in
there
if
you
like
ill
met
you
tomorrow
he
felt
certain
that
she
would
not
keep
an
appointment
he
was
not
going
to
let
her
go
no
you
must
take
me
somewhere
now
well
there
is
a
room
i
know
but
theyll
charge
six
shillings
for
it
i
dont
mind
that
where
is
it
she
gave
him
the
address
and
he
called
a
cab
they
drove
to
a
shabby
street
beyond
the
british
museum
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
grays
inn
road
and
she
stopped
the
cab
at
the
corner
they
dont
like
you
to
drive
up
to
the
door
she
said
they
were
the
first
words
either
of
them
had
spoken
since
getting
into
the
cab
they
walked
a
few
yards
and
mildred
knocked
three
times
sharply
at
a
door
philip
noticed
in
the
fanlight
a
cardboard
on
which
was
an
announcement
that
apartments
were
to
let
the
door
was
opened
quietly
and
an
elderly
tall
woman
let
them
in
she
gave
philip
a
stare
and
then
spoke
to
mildred
in
an
undertone
mildred
led
philip
along
a
passage
to
a
room
at
the
back
it
was
quite
dark
she
asked
him
for
a
match
and
lit
the
gas
there
was
no
globe
and
the
gas
flared
shrilly
philip
saw
that
he
was
in
a
dingy
little
bedroom
with
a
suite
of
furniture
painted
to
look
like
pine
much
too
large
for
it
the
lace
curtains
were
very
dirty
the
grate
was
hidden
by
a
large
paper
fan
mildred
sank
on
the
chair
which
stood
by
the
side
of
the
chimneypiece
philip
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
he
felt
ashamed
he
saw
now
that
mildreds
cheeks
were
thick
with
rouge
her
eyebrows
were
blackened
but
she
looked
thin
and
ill
and
the
red
on
her
cheeks
exaggerated
the
greenish
pallor
of
her
skin
she
stared
at
the
paper
fan
in
a
listless
fashion
philip
could
not
think
what
to
say
and
he
had
a
choking
in
his
throat
as
if
he
were
going
to
cry
he
covered
his
eyes
with
his
hands
my
god
it
is
awful
he
groaned
i
dont
know
what
youve
got
to
fuss
about
i
should
have
thought
youd
have
been
rather
pleased
philip
did
not
answer
and
in
a
moment
she
broke
into
a
sob
you
dont
think
i
do
it
because
i
like
it
do
you
oh
my
dear
he
cried
im
so
sorry
im
so
awfully
sorry
thatll
do
me
a
fat
lot
of
good
again
philip
found
nothing
to
say
he
was
desperately
afraid
of
saying
anything
which
she
might
take
for
a
reproach
or
a
sneer
wheres
the
baby
he
asked
at
last
ive
got
her
with
me
in
london

hadnt
got
the
money
to
keep
her
on
at
brighton

had
to
take
her
ive
got
a
room
up
highbury
way
i
told
them
i
was
on
the
stage
its
a
long
way
to
have
to
come

west

every
day
but
its
a
rare
job
to

all

they
take
you
back
at
the
shop
i
couldnt
get

i
walked
my
legs
off
looking
for
work
i
did
get
a
job
once
but
i
was
off
for
a
week
because
i
was
queer
and
when
i
went
back
they
said
they
didnt
want

more
you

blame
them
either

you
them

they
cant

to

philip
i

but
i
couldnt
help
myself
i
wanted
the
money
i
wrote
to
emil
and
told
him

broke
but
he
never
even
answered
the
letter
you
might
have
written
to
me
i
didnt
like
to
not
after
what
happened
and
i
didnt
want
you
to

in
difficulties
i
shouldnt

been
surprised

just
told
me

what
i
deserved
you
dont
know
me
very
well
do
you
even
now
for
a
moment
he
remembered
all
the
anguish
he
had
suffered
on
her
account
and
he
was
sick
with
the
recollection
of
his
pain
but
it
was
no
more
than
recollection
when
he
looked
at
her
he
knew
that
he
no
longer
loved
her
he
was
very
sorry
for
her
but
he
was
glad
to
be
free
watching
her
gravely
he
asked
himself
why
he
had
been
so
besotted
with
passion
for
her
youre
a
gentleman
in
every
sense
of
the
word
she
said
youre
the
only
one
ive
ever
met
she
paused
for
a
minute
and
then
flushed
i
hate
asking
you
philip
but
can
you
spare
me
anything
its
lucky
ive
got
some
money
on
me
im
afraid
ive
only
got
two
pounds
he
gave
her
the
sovereigns
ill
pay
you
back
philip
oh
thats
all
right
he
smiled
you
neednt
worry
he
had
said
nothing
that
he
wanted
to
say
they
had
talked
as
if
the
whole
thing
were
natural
and
it
looked
as
though
she
would
go
now
back
to
the
horror
of
her
life
and
he
would
be
able
to
do
nothing
to
prevent
it
she
had
got
up
to
take
the
money
and
they
were
both
standing
am
i
keeping
you
she
asked
i
suppose
you
want
to
be
getting
home
no
im
in
no
hurry
he
answered
im
glad
to
have
a
chance
of
sitting
down
those
words
with
all
they
implied
tore
his
heart
and
it
was
dreadfully
painful
to
see
the
weary
way
in
which
she
sank
back
into
the
chair
the
silence
lasted
so
long
that
philip
in
his
embarrassment
lit
a
cigarette
its
very
good
of
you
not
to
have
said
anything
disagreeable
to
me
philip
i
thought
you
might
say
i
didnt
know
what
all
he
saw
that
she
was
crying
again
he
remembered
how
she
had
come
to
him
when
emil
miller
had
deserted
her
and
how
she
had
wept
the
recollection
of
her
suffering
and
of
his
own
humiliation
seemed
to
render
more
overwhelming
the
compassion
he
felt
now
if
i
could
only
get
out
of
it
she
moaned
i
hate
it
so
im
unfit
for
the
life
im
not
the
sort
of
girl
for
that
id
do
anything
to
get
away
from
it
id
be
a
servant
if
i
could
oh
i
wish
i
was
dead
and
in
pity
for
herself
she
broke
down
now
completely
she
sobbed
hysterically
and
her
thin
body
was
shaken
oh
you
dont
know
what
it
is
nobody
knows
till
theyve
done
it
philip
could
not
bear
to
see
her
cry
he
was
tortured
by
the
horror
of
her
position
poor
child
he
whispered
poor
child
he
was
deeply
moved
suddenly
he
had
an
inspiration
it
filled
him
with
a
perfect
ecstasy
of
happiness
look
here
if
you
want
to
get
away
from
it
ive
got
an
idea
im
frightfully
hard
up
just
now
ive
got
to
be
as
economical
as
i
can
but
ive
got
a
sort
of
little
flat
now
in
kennington
and
ive
got
a
spare
room
if
you
like
you
and
the
baby
can
come
and
live
there
i
pay
a
woman
three
and
sixpence
a
week
to
keep
the
place
clean
and
to
do
a
little
cooking
for
me
you
could
do
that
and
your
food
wouldnt
come
to
much
more
than
the
money
i
should
save
on
her
it
doesnt
cost
any
more
to
feed
two
than
one
and
i
dont
suppose
the
baby
eats
much
she
stopped
crying
and
looked
at
him
dyou
mean
to
say
that
you
could
take
me
back
after
all
thats
happened
philip
flushed
a
little
in
embarrassment
at
what
he
had
to
say
i
dont
want
you
to
mistake
me
im
just
giving
you
a
room
which
doesnt
cost
me
anything
and
your
food
i
dont
expect
anything
more
from
you
than
that
you
should
do
exactly
the
same
as
the
woman
i
have
in
does
except
for
that
i
dont
want
anything
from
you
at
all
i
daresay
you
can
cook
well
enough
for
that
she
sprang
to
her
feet
and
was
about
to
come
towards
him
you
are
good
to
me
philip
no
please
stop
where
you
are
he
said
hurriedly
putting
out
his
hand
as
though
to
push
her
away
he
did
not
know
why
it
was
but
he
could
not
bear
the
thought
that
she
should
touch
him
i
dont
want
to
be
anything
more
than
a
friend
to
you
you
are
good
to
me
she
repeated
you
are
good
to
me
does
that
mean
youll
come
oh
yes
id
do
anything
to
get
away
from
this
youll
never
regret
what
youve
done
philip
never
when
can
i
come
philip
youd
better
come
tomorrow
suddenly
she
burst
into
tears
again
what
on
earth
are
you
crying
for
now
he
smiled
im
so
grateful
to
you
i
dont
know
how
i
can
ever
make
it
up
to
you
oh
thats
all
right
youd
better
go
home
now
he
wrote
out
the
address
and
told
her
that
if
she
came
at
half
past
five
he
would
be
ready
for
her
it
was
so
late
that
he
had
to
walk
home
but
it
did
not
seem
a
long
way
for
he
was
intoxicated
with
delight
he
seemed
to
walk
on
air
chapter
xci
next
day
he
got
up
early
to
make
the
room
ready
for
mildred
he
told
the
woman
who
had
looked
after
him
that
he
would
not
want
her
any
more
mildred
came
about
six
and
philip
who
was
watching
from
the
window
went
down
to
let
her
in
and
help
her
to
bring
up
the
luggage
it
consisted
now
of
no
more
than
three
large
parcels
wrapped
in
brown
paper
for
she
had
been
obliged
to
sell
everything
that
was
not
absolutely
needful
she
wore
the
same
black
silk
dress
she
had
worn
the
night
before
and
though
she
had
now
no
rouge
on
her
cheeks
there
was
still
about
her
eyes
the
black
which
remained
after
a
perfunctory
wash
in
the
morning
it
made
her
look
very
ill
she
was
a
pathetic
figure
as
she
stepped
out
of
the
cab
with
the
baby
in
her
arms
she
seemed
a
little
shy
and
they
found
nothing
but
commonplace
things
to
say
to
one
another
so
youve
got
here
all
right
ive
never
lived
in
this
part
of
london
before
philip
showed
her
the
room
it
was
that
in
which
cronshaw
had
died
philip
though
he
thought
it
absurd
had
never
liked
the
idea
of
going
back
to
it
and
since
cronshaws
death
he
had
remained
in
the
little
room
sleeping
on
a
foldup
bed
into
which
he
had
first
moved
in
order
to
make
his
friend
comfortable
the
baby
was
sleeping
placidly
you
dont
recognise
her
i
expect
said
mildred
ive
not
seen
her
since
we
took
her
down
to
brighton
where
shall
i
put
her
shes
so
heavy
i
cant
carry
her
very
long
im
afraid
i
havent
got
a
cradle
said
philip
with
a
nervous
laugh
oh
shell
sleep
with
me
she
always
does
mildred
put
the
baby
in
an
armchair
and
looked
round
the
room
she
recognised
most
of
the
things
which
she
had
known
in
his
old
diggings
only
one
thing
was
new
a
head
and
shoulders
of
philip
which
lawson
had
painted
at
the
end
of
the
preceding
summer
it
hung
over
the
chimneypiece
mildred
looked
at
it
critically
in
some
ways
i
like
it
and
in
some
ways
i
dont
i
think
youre
better
looking
than
that
things
are
looking
up
laughed
philip
youve
never
told
me
i
was
goodlooking
before
im
not
one
to
worry
myself
about
a
mans
looks
i
dont
like
goodlooking
men
theyre
too
conceited
for
me
her
eyes
travelled
round
the
room
in
an
instinctive
search
for
a
lookingglass
but
there
was
none
she
put
up
her
hand
and
patted
her
large
fringe
whatll
the
other
people
in
the
house
say
to
my
being
here
she
asked
suddenly
oh
theres
only
a
man
and
his
wife
living
here
hes
out
all
day
and
i
never
see
her
except
on
saturday
to
pay
my
rent
they
keep
entirely
to
themselves
ive
not
spoken
two
words
to
either
of
them
since
i
came
mildred
went
into
the
bedroom
to
undo
her
things
and
put
them
away
philip
tried
to
read
but
his
spirits
were
too
high
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
smoking
a
cigarette
and
with
smiling
eyes
looked
at
the
sleeping
child
he
felt
very
happy
he
was
quite
sure
that
he
was
not
at
all
in
love
with
mildred
he
was
surprised
that
the
old
feeling
had
left
him
so
completely
he
discerned
in
himself
a
faint
physical
repulsion
from
her
and
he
thought
that
if
he
touched
her
it
would
give
him
gooseflesh
he
could
not
understand
himself
presently
knocking
at
the
door
she
came
in
again
i
say
you
neednt
knock
he
said
have
you
made
the
tour
of
the
mansion
its
the
smallest
kitchen
ive
ever
seen
youll
find
it
large
enough
to
cook
our
sumptuous
repasts
he
retorted
lightly
i
see
theres
nothing
in
id
better
go
out
and
get
something
yes
but
i
venture
to
remind
you
that
we
must
be
devilish
economical
what
shall
i
get
for
supper
youd
better
get
what
you
think
you
can
cook
laughed
philip
he
gave
her
some
money
and
she
went
out
she
came
in
half
an
hour
later
and
put
her
purchases
on
the
table
she
was
out
of
breath
from
climbing
the
stairs
i
say
you
are
anaemic
said
philip
ill
have
to
dose
you
with
blauds
pills
it
took
me
some
time
to
find
the
shops
i
bought
some
liver
thats
tasty
isnt
it
and
you
cant
eat
much
of
it
so
its
more
economical
than
butchers
meat
there
was
a
gas
stove
in
the
kitchen
and
when
she
had
put
the
liver
on
mildred
came
into
the
sittingroom
to
lay
the
cloth
why
are
you
only
laying
one
place
asked
philip
arent
you
going
to
eat
anything
mildred
flushed
i
thought
you
mightnt
like
me
to
have
my
meals
with
you
why
on
earth
not
well
im
only
a
servant
arent
i
dont
be
an
ass
how
can
you
be
so
silly
he
smiled
but
her
humility
gave
him
a
curious
twist
in
his
heart
poor
thing
he
remembered
what
she
had
been
when
first
he
knew
her
he
hesitated
for
an
instant
dont
think
im
conferring
any
benefit
on
you
he
said
its
simply
a
business
arrangement
im
giving
you
board
and
lodging
in
return
for
your
work
you
dont
owe
me
anything
and
theres
nothing
humiliating
to
you
in
it
she
did
not
answer
but
tears
rolled
heavily
down
her
cheeks
philip
knew
from
his
experience
at
the
hospital
that
women
of
her
class
looked
upon
service
as
degrading
he
could
not
help
feeling
a
little
impatient
with
her
but
he
blamed
himself
for
it
was
clear
that
she
was
tired
and
ill
he
got
up
and
helped
her
to
lay
another
place
at
the
table
the
baby
was
awake
now
and
mildred
had
prepared
some
mellins
food
for
it
the
liver
and
bacon
were
ready
and
they
sat
down
for
economys
sake
philip
had
given
up
drinking
anything
but
water
but
he
had
in
the
house
a
half
a
bottle
of
whiskey
and
he
thought
a
little
would
do
mildred
good
he
did
his
best
to
make
the
supper
pass
cheerfully
but
mildred
was
subdued
and
exhausted
when
they
had
finished
she
got
up
to
put
the
baby
to
bed
i
think
youll
do
well
to
turn
in
early
yourself
said
philip
you
look
absolute
done
up
i
think
i
will
after
ive
washed
up
philip
lit
his
pipe
and
began
to
read
it
was
pleasant
to
hear
somebody
moving
about
in
the
next
room
sometimes
his
loneliness
had
oppressed
him
mildred
came
in
to
clear
the
table
and
he
heard
the
clatter
of
plates
as
she
washed
up
philip
smiled
as
he
thought
how
characteristic
it
was
of
her
that
she
should
do
all
that
in
a
black
silk
dress
but
he
had
work
to
do
and
he
brought
his
book
up
to
the
table
he
was
reading
oslers
medicine
which
had
recently
taken
the
place
in
the
students
favour
of
taylors
work
for
many
years
the
textbook
most
in
use
presently
mildred
came
in
rolling
down
her
sleeves
philip
gave
her
a
casual
glance
but
did
not
move
the
occasion
was
curious
and
he
felt
a
little
nervous
he
feared
that
mildred
might
imagine
he
was
going
to
make
a
nuisance
of
himself
and
he
did
not
quite
know
how
without
brutality
to
reassure
her
by
the
way
ive
got
a
lecture
at
nine
so
i
should
want
breakfast
at
a
quarter
past
eight
can
you
manage
that
oh
yes
why
when
i
was
in
parliament
street
i
used
to
catch
the
eighttwelve
from
herne
hill
every
morning
i
hope
youll
find
your
room
comfortable
youll
be
a
different
woman
tomorrow
after
a
long
night
in
bed
i
suppose
you
work
till
late
i
generally
work
till
about
eleven
or
halfpast
ill
say
goodnight
then
goodnight
the
table
was
between
them
he
did
not
offer
to
shake
hands
with
her
she
shut
the
door
quietly
he
heard
her
moving
about
in
the
bedroom
and
in
a
little
while
he
heard
the
creaking
of
the
bed
as
she
got
in
chapter
xcii
the
following
day
was
tuesday
philip
as
usual
hurried
through
his
breakfast
and
dashed
off
to
get
to
his
lecture
at
nine
he
had
only
time
to
exchange
a
few
words
with
mildred
when
he
came
back
in
the
evening
he
found
her
seated
at
the
window
darning
his
socks
i
say
you
are
industrious
he
smiled
what
have
you
been
doing
with
yourself
all
day
oh
i
gave
the
place
a
good
cleaning
and
then
i
took
baby
out
for
a
little
she
was
wearing
an
old
black
dress
the
same
as
she
had
worn
as
uniform
when
she
served
in
the
teashop
it
was
shabby
but
she
looked
better
in
it
than
in
the
silk
of
the
day
before
the
baby
was
sitting
on
the
floor
she
looked
up
at
philip
with
large
mysterious
eyes
and
broke
into
a
laugh
when
he
sat
down
beside
her
and
began
playing
with
her
bare
toes
the
afternoon
sun
came
into
the
room
and
shed
a
mellow
light
its
rather
jolly
to
come
back
and
find
someone
about
the
place
a
woman
and
a
baby
make
very
good
decoration
in
a
room
he
had
gone
to
the
hospital
dispensary
and
got
a
bottle
of
blauds
pills
he
gave
them
to
mildred
and
told
her
she
must
take
them
after
each
meal
it
was
a
remedy
she
was
used
to
for
she
had
taken
it
off
and
on
ever
since
she
was
sixteen
im
sure
lawson
would
love
that
green
skin
of
yours
said
philip
hed
say
it
was
so
paintable
but
im
terribly
matter
of
fact
nowadays
and
i
shant
be
happy
till
youre
as
pink
and
white
as
a
milkmaid
i
feel
better
already
after
a
frugal
supper
philip
filled
his
pouch
with
tobacco
and
put
on
his
hat
it
was
on
tuesdays
that
he
generally
went
to
the
tavern
in
beak
street
and
he
was
glad
that
this
day
came
so
soon
after
mildreds
arrival
for
he
wanted
to
make
his
relations
with
her
perfectly
clear
are
you
going
out
she
said
yes
on
tuesdays
i
give
myself
a
night
off
i
shall
see
you
tomorrow
goodnight
philip
always
went
to
the
tavern
with
a
sense
of
pleasure
macalister
the
philosophic
stockbroker
was
generally
there
and
glad
to
argue
upon
any
subject
under
the
sun
hayward
came
regularly
when
he
was
in
london
and
though
he
and
macalister
disliked
one
another
they
continued
out
of
habit
to
meet
on
that
one
evening
in
the
week
macalister
thought
hayward
a
poor
creature
and
sneered
at
his
delicacies
of
sentiment
he
asked
satirically
about
haywards
literary
work
and
received
with
scornful
smiles
his
vague
suggestions
of
future
masterpieces
their
arguments
were
often
heated
but
the
punch
was
good
and
they
were
both
fond
of
it
towards
the
end
of
the
evening
they
generally
composed
their
differences
and
thought
each
other
capital
fellows
this
evening
philip
found
them
both
there
and
lawson
also
lawson
came
more
seldom
now
that
he
was
beginning
to
know
people
in
london
and
went
out
to
dinner
a
good
deal
they
were
all
on
excellent
terms
with
themselves
for
macalister
had
given
them
a
good
thing
on
the
stock
exchange
and
hayward
and
lawson
had
made
fifty
pounds
apiece
it
was
a
great
thing
for
lawson
who
was
extravagant
and
earned
little
money
he
had
arrived
at
that
stage
of
the
portraitpainters
career
when
he
was
noticed
a
good
deal
by
the
critics
and
found
a
number
of
aristocratic
ladies
who
were
willing
to
allow
him
to
paint
them
for
nothing
it
advertised
them
both
and
gave
the
great
ladies
quite
an
air
of
patronesses
of
the
arts
but
he
very
seldom
got
hold
of
the
solid
philistine
who
was
ready
to
pay
good
money
for
a
portrait
of
his
wife
lawson
was
brimming
over
with
satisfaction
its
the
most
ripping
way
of
making
money
that
ive
ever
struck
he
cried
i
didnt
have
to
put
my
hand
in
my
pocket
for
sixpence
you
lost
something
by
not
being
here
last
tuesday
young
man
said
macalister
to
philip
my
god
why
didnt
you
write
to
me
said
philip
if
you
only
knew
how
useful
a
hundred
pounds
would
be
to
me
oh
there
wasnt
time
for
that
one
has
to
be
on
the
spot
i
heard
of
a
good
thing
last
tuesday
and
i
asked
these
fellows
if
theyd
like
to
have
a
flutter
i
bought
them
a
thousand
shares
on
wednesday
morning
and
there
was
a
rise
in
the
afternoon
so
i
sold
them
at
once
i
made
fifty
pounds
for
each
of
them
and
a
couple
of
hundred
for
myself
philip
was
sick
with
envy
he
had
recently
sold
the
last
mortgage
in
which
his
small
fortune
had
been
invested
and
now
had
only
six
hundred
pounds
left
he
was
panicstricken
sometimes
when
he
thought
of
the
future
he
had
still
to
keep
himself
for
two
years
before
he
could
be
qualified
and
then
he
meant
to
try
for
hospital
appointments
so
that
he
could
not
expect
to
earn
anything
for
three
years
at
least
with
the
most
rigid
economy
he
would
not
have
more
than
a
hundred
pounds
left
then
it
was
very
little
to
have
as
a
standby
in
case
he
was
ill
and
could
not
earn
money
or
found
himself
at
any
time
without
work
a
lucky
gamble
would
make
all
the
difference
to
him
oh
well
it
doesnt
matter
said
macalister
something
is
sure
to
turn
up
soon
therell
be
a
boom
in
south
africans
again
one
of
these
days
and
then
ill
see
what
i
can
do
for
you
macalister
was
in
the
kaffir
market
and
often
told
them
stories
of
the
sudden
fortunes
that
had
been
made
in
the
great
boom
of
a
year
or
two
back
well
dont
forget
next
time
they
sat
on
talking
till
nearly
midnight
and
philip
who
lived
furthest
off
was
the
first
to
go
if
he
did
not
catch
the
last
tram
he
had
to
walk
and
that
made
him
very
late
as
it
was
he
did
not
reach
home
till
nearly
half
past
twelve
when
he
got
upstairs
he
was
surprised
to
find
mildred
still
sitting
in
his
armchair
why
on
earth
arent
you
in
bed
he
cried
i
wasnt
sleepy
you
ought
to
go
to
bed
all
the
same
it
would
rest
you
she
did
not
move
he
noticed
that
since
supper
she
had
changed
into
her
black
silk
dress
i
thought
id
rather
wait
up
for
you
in
case
you
wanted
anything
she
looked
at
him
and
the
shadow
of
a
smile
played
upon
her
thin
pale
lips
philip
was
not
sure
whether
he
understood
or
not
he
was
slightly
embarrassed
but
assumed
a
cheerful
matteroffact
air
its
very
nice
of
you
but
its
very
naughty
also
run
off
to
bed
as
fast
as
you
can
or
you
wont
be
able
to
get
up
tomorrow
morning
i
dont
feel
like
going
to
bed
nonsense
he
said
coldly
she
got
up
a
little
sulkily
and
went
into
her
room
he
smiled
when
he
heard
her
lock
the
door
loudly
the
next
few
days
passed
without
incident
mildred
settled
down
in
her
new
surroundings
when
philip
hurried
off
after
breakfast
she
had
the
whole
morning
to
do
the
housework
they
ate
very
simply
but
she
liked
to
take
a
long
time
to
buy
the
few
things
they
needed
she
could
not
be
bothered
to
cook
anything
for
her
dinner
hut
made
herself
some
cocoa
and
ate
bread
and
butter
then
she
took
the
baby
out
in
the
gocart
and
when
she
came
in
spent
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
in
idleness
she
was
tired
out
and
it
suited
her
to
do
so
little
she
made
friends
with
philips
forbidding
landlady
over
the
rent
which
he
left
with
mildred
to
pay
and
within
a
week
was
able
to
tell
him
more
about
his
neighbours
than
he
had
learned
in
a
year
shes
a
very
nice
woman
said
mildred
quite
the
lady
i
told
her
we
was
married
dyou
think
that
was
necessary
well
i
had
to
tell
her
something
it
looks
so
funny
me
being
here
and
not
married
to
you
i
didnt
know
what
shed
think
of
me
i
dont
suppose
she
believed
you
for
a
moment
that
she
did
i
lay
i
told
her
wed
been
married
two
yearsi
had
to
say
that
you
know
because
of
babyonly
your
people
wouldnt
hear
of
it
because
you
was
only
a
studentshe
pronounced
it
stoodentand
so
we
had
to
keep
it
a
secret
but
theyd
given
way
now
and
we
were
all
going
down
to
stay
with
them
in
the
summer
youre
a
past
mistress
of
the
cockandbull
story
said
philip
he
was
vaguely
irritated
that
mildred
still
had
this
passion
for
telling
fibs
in
the
last
two
years
she
had
learnt
nothing
but
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
when
alls
said
and
done
he
reflected
she
hasnt
had
much
chance
it
was
a
beautiful
evening
warm
and
cloudless
and
the
people
of
south
london
seemed
to
have
poured
out
into
the
streets
there
was
that
restlessness
in
the
air
which
seizes
the
cockney
sometimes
when
a
turn
in
the
weather
calls
him
into
the
open
after
mildred
had
cleared
away
the
supper
she
went
and
stood
at
the
window
the
street
noises
came
up
to
them
noises
of
people
calling
to
one
another
of
the
passing
traffic
of
a
barrelorgan
in
the
distance
i
suppose
you
must
work
tonight
philip
she
asked
him
with
a
wistful
expression
i
ought
but
i
dont
know
that
i
must
why
dyou
want
me
to
do
anything
else
id
like
to
go
out
for
a
bit
couldnt
we
take
a
ride
on
the
top
of
a
tram
if
you
like
ill
just
go
and
put
on
my
hat
she
said
joyfully
the
night
made
it
almost
impossible
to
stay
indoors
the
baby
was
asleep
and
could
be
safely
left
mildred
said
she
had
always
left
it
alone
at
night
when
she
went
out
it
never
woke
she
was
in
high
spirits
when
she
came
back
with
her
hat
on
she
had
taken
the
opportunity
to
put
on
a
little
rouge
philip
thought
it
was
excitement
which
had
brought
a
faint
colour
to
her
pale
cheeks
he
was
touched
by
her
childlike
delight
and
reproached
himself
for
the
austerity
with
which
he
had
treated
her
she
laughed
when
she
got
out
into
the
air
the
first
tram
they
saw
was
going
towards
westminster
bridge
and
they
got
on
it
philip
smoked
his
pipe
and
they
looked
at
the
crowded
street
the
shops
were
open
gaily
lit
and
people
were
doing
their
shopping
for
the
next
day
they
passed
a
musichall
called
the
canterbury
and
mildred
cried
out
oh
philip
do
lets
go
there
i
havent
been
to
a
musichall
for
months
we
cant
afford
stalls
you
know
oh
i
dont
mind
i
shall
be
quite
happy
in
the
gallery
they
got
down
and
walked
back
a
hundred
yards
till
they
came
to
the
doors
they
got
capital
seats
for
sixpence
each
high
up
but
not
in
the
gallery
and
the
night
was
so
fine
that
there
was
plenty
of
room
mildreds
eyes
glistened
she
enjoyed
herself
thoroughly
there
was
a
simplemindedness
in
her
which
touched
philip
she
was
a
puzzle
to
him
certain
things
in
her
still
pleased
him
and
he
thought
that
there
was
a
lot
in
her
which
was
very
good
she
had
been
badly
brought
up
and
her
life
was
hard
he
had
blamed
her
for
much
that
she
could
not
help
and
it
was
his
own
fault
if
he
had
asked
virtues
from
her
which
it
was
not
in
her
power
to
give
under
different
circumstances
she
might
have
been
a
charming
girl
she
was
extraordinarily
unfit
for
the
battle
of
life
as
he
watched
her
now
in
profile
her
mouth
slightly
open
and
that
delicate
flush
on
her
cheeks
he
thought
she
looked
strangely
virginal
he
felt
an
overwhelming
compassion
for
her
and
with
all
his
heart
he
forgave
her
for
the
misery
she
had
caused
him
the
smoky
atmosphere
made
philips
eyes
ache
but
when
he
suggested
going
she
turned
to
him
with
beseeching
face
and
asked
him
to
stay
till
the
end
he
smiled
and
consented
she
took
his
hand
and
held
it
for
the
rest
of
the
performance
when
they
streamed
out
with
the
audience
into
the
crowded
street
she
did
not
want
to
go
home
they
wandered
up
the
westminster
bridge
road
looking
at
the
people
ive
not
had
such
a
good
time
as
this
for
months
she
said
philips
heart
was
full
and
he
was
thankful
to
the
fates
because
he
had
carried
out
his
sudden
impulse
to
take
mildred
and
her
baby
into
his
flat
it
was
very
pleasant
to
see
her
happy
gratitude
at
last
she
grew
tired
and
they
jumped
on
a
tram
to
go
home
it
was
late
now
and
when
they
got
down
and
turned
into
their
own
street
there
was
no
one
about
mildred
slipped
her
arm
through
his
its
just
like
old
times
phil
she
said
she
had
never
called
him
phil
before
that
was
what
griffiths
called
him
and
even
now
it
gave
him
a
curious
pang
he
remembered
how
much
he
had
wanted
to
die
then
his
pain
had
been
so
great
that
he
had
thought
quite
seriously
of
committing
suicide
it
all
seemed
very
long
ago
he
smiled
at
his
past
self
now
he
felt
nothing
for
mildred
but
infinite
pity
they
reached
the
house
and
when
they
got
into
the
sittingroom
philip
lit
the
gas
is
the
baby
all
right
he
asked
ill
just
go
in
and
see
when
she
came
back
it
was
to
say
that
it
had
not
stirred
since
she
left
it
it
was
a
wonderful
child
philip
held
out
his
hand
well
goodnight
dyou
want
to
go
to
bed
already
its
nearly
one
im
not
used
to
late
hours
these
days
said
philip
she
took
his
hand
and
holding
it
looked
into
his
eyes
with
a
little
smile
phil
the
other
night
in
that
room
when
you
asked
me
to
come
and
stay
here
i
didnt
mean
what
you
thought
i
meant
when
you
said
you
didnt
want
me
to
be
anything
to
you
except
just
to
cook
and
that
sort
of
thing
didnt
you
answered
philip
withdrawing
his
hand
i
did
dont
be
such
an
old
silly
she
laughed
he
shook
his
head
i
meant
it
quite
seriously
i
shouldnt
have
asked
you
to
stay
here
on
any
other
condition
why
not
i
feel
i
couldnt
i
cant
explain
it
but
it
would
spoil
it
all
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
oh
very
well
its
just
as
you
choose
im
not
one
to
go
down
on
my
hands
and
knees
for
that
and
chance
it
she
went
out
slamming
the
door
behind
her
chapter
xciii
next
morning
mildred
was
sulky
and
taciturn
she
remained
in
her
room
till
it
was
time
to
get
the
dinner
ready
she
was
a
bad
cook
and
could
do
little
more
than
chops
and
steaks
and
she
did
not
know
how
to
use
up
odds
and
ends
so
that
philip
was
obliged
to
spend
more
money
than
he
had
expected
when
she
served
up
she
sat
down
opposite
philip
but
would
eat
nothing
he
remarked
on
it
she
said
she
had
a
bad
headache
and
was
not
hungry
he
was
glad
that
he
had
somewhere
to
spend
the
rest
of
the
day
the
athelnys
were
cheerful
and
friendly
it
was
a
delightful
and
an
unexpected
thing
to
realise
that
everyone
in
that
household
looked
forward
with
pleasure
to
his
visit
mildred
had
gone
to
bed
when
he
came
back
but
next
day
she
was
still
silent
at
supper
she
sat
with
a
haughty
expression
on
her
face
and
a
little
frown
between
her
eyes
it
made
philip
impatient
but
he
told
himself
that
he
must
be
considerate
to
her
he
was
bound
to
make
allowance
youre
very
silent
he
said
with
a
pleasant
smile
im
paid
to
cook
and
clean
i
didnt
know
i
was
expected
to
talk
as
well
he
thought
it
an
ungracious
answer
but
if
they
were
going
to
live
together
he
must
do
all
he
could
to
make
things
go
easily
im
afraid
youre
cross
with
me
about
the
other
night
he
said
it
was
an
awkward
thing
to
speak
about
but
apparently
it
was
necessary
to
discuss
it
i
dont
know
what
you
mean
she
answered
please
dont
be
angry
with
me
i
should
never
have
asked
you
to
come
and
live
here
if
id
not
meant
our
relations
to
be
merely
friendly
i
suggested
it
because
i
thought
you
wanted
a
home
and
you
would
have
a
chance
of
looking
about
for
something
to
do
oh
dont
think
i
care
i
dont
for
a
moment
he
hastened
to
say
you
mustnt
think
im
ungrateful
i
realise
that
you
only
proposed
it
for
my
sake
its
just
a
feeling
i
have
and
i
cant
help
it
it
would
make
the
whole
thing
ugly
and
horrid
you
are
funny
she
said
looking
at
him
curiously
i
cant
make
you
out
she
was
not
angry
with
him
now
but
puzzled
she
had
no
idea
what
he
meant
she
accepted
the
situation
she
had
indeed
a
vague
feeling
that
he
was
behaving
in
a
very
noble
fashion
and
that
she
ought
to
admire
it
but
also
she
felt
inclined
to
laugh
at
him
and
perhaps
even
to
despise
him
a
little
hes
a
rum
customer
she
thought
life
went
smoothly
enough
with
them
philip
spent
all
day
at
the
hospital
and
worked
at
home
in
the
evening
except
when
he
went
to
the
athelnys
or
to
the
tavern
in
beak
street
once
the
physician
for
whom
he
clerked
asked
him
to
a
solemn
dinner
and
two
or
three
times
he
went
to
parties
given
by
fellowstudents
mildred
accepted
the
monotony
of
her
life
if
she
minded
that
philip
left
her
sometimes
by
herself
in
the
evening
she
never
mentioned
it
occasionally
he
took
her
to
a
music
hall
he
carried
out
his
intention
that
the
only
tie
between
them
should
be
the
domestic
service
she
did
in
return
for
board
and
lodging
she
had
made
up
her
mind
that
it
was
no
use
trying
to
get
work
that
summer
and
with
philips
approval
determined
to
stay
where
she
was
till
the
autumn
she
thought
it
would
be
easy
to
get
something
to
do
then
as
far
as
im
concerned
you
can
stay
on
here
when
youve
got
a
job
if
its
convenient
the
rooms
there
and
the
woman
who
did
for
me
before
can
come
in
to
look
after
the
baby
he
grew
very
much
attached
to
mildreds
child
he
had
a
naturally
affectionate
disposition
which
had
had
little
opportunity
to
display
itself
mildred
was
not
unkind
to
the
little
girl
she
looked
after
her
very
well
and
once
when
she
had
a
bad
cold
proved
herself
a
devoted
nurse
but
the
child
bored
her
and
she
spoke
to
her
sharply
when
she
bothered
she
was
fond
of
her
but
had
not
the
maternal
passion
which
might
have
induced
her
to
forget
herself
mildred
had
no
demonstrativeness
and
she
found
the
manifestations
of
affection
ridiculous
when
philip
sat
with
the
baby
on
his
knees
playing
with
it
and
kissing
it
she
laughed
at
him
you
couldnt
make
more
fuss
of
her
if
you
was
her
father
she
said
youre
perfectly
silly
with
the
child
philip
flushed
for
he
hated
to
be
laughed
at
it
was
absurd
to
be
so
devoted
to
another
mans
baby
and
he
was
a
little
ashamed
of
the
overflowing
of
his
heart
but
the
child
feeling
philips
attachment
would
put
her
face
against
his
or
nestle
in
his
arms
its
all
very
fine
for
you
said
mildred
you
dont
have
any
of
the
disagreeable
part
of
it
how
would
you
like
being
kept
awake
for
an
hour
in
the
middle
of
the
night
because
her
ladyship
wouldnt
go
to
sleep
philip
remembered
all
sorts
of
things
of
his
childhood
which
he
thought
he
had
long
forgotten
he
took
hold
of
the
babys
toes
this
little
pig
went
to
market
this
little
pig
stayed
at
home
when
he
came
home
in
the
evening
and
entered
the
sittingroom
his
first
glance
was
for
the
baby
sprawling
on
the
floor
and
it
gave
him
a
little
thrill
of
delight
to
hear
the
childs
crow
of
pleasure
at
seeing
him
mildred
taught
her
to
call
him
daddy
and
when
the
child
did
this
for
the
first
time
of
her
own
accord
laughed
immoderately
i
wonder
if
youre
that
stuck
on
baby
because
shes
mine
asked
mildred
or
if
youd
be
the
same
with
anybodys
baby
ive
never
known
anybody
elses
baby
so
i
cant
say
said
philip
towards
the
end
of
his
second
term
as
inpatients
clerk
a
piece
of
good
fortune
befell
philip
it
was
the
middle
of
july
he
went
one
tuesday
evening
to
the
tavern
in
beak
street
and
found
nobody
there
but
macalister
they
sat
together
chatting
about
their
absent
friends
and
after
a
while
macalister
said
to
him
oh
by
the
way
i
heard
of
a
rather
good
thing
today
new
kleinfonteins
its
a
gold
mine
in
rhodesia
if
youd
like
to
have
a
flutter
you
might
make
a
bit
philip
had
been
waiting
anxiously
for
such
an
opportunity
but
now
that
it
came
he
hesitated
he
was
desperately
afraid
of
losing
money
he
had
little
of
the
gamblers
spirit
id
love
to
but
i
dont
know
if
i
dare
risk
it
how
much
could
i
lose
if
things
went
wrong
i
shouldnt
have
spoken
of
it
only
you
seemed
so
keen
about
it
macalister
answered
coldly
philip
felt
that
macalister
looked
upon
him
as
rather
a
donkey
im
awfully
keen
on
making
a
bit
he
laughed
you
cant
make
money
unless
youre
prepared
to
risk
money
macalister
began
to
talk
of
other
things
and
philip
while
he
was
answering
him
kept
thinking
that
if
the
venture
turned
out
well
the
stockbroker
would
be
very
facetious
at
his
expense
next
time
they
met
macalister
had
a
sarcastic
tongue
i
think
i
will
have
a
flutter
if
you
dont
mind
said
philip
anxiously
all
right
ill
buy
you
two
hundred
and
fifty
shares
and
if
i
see
a
halfcrown
rise
ill
sell
them
at
once
philip
quickly
reckoned
out
how
much
that
would
amount
to
and
his
mouth
watered
thirty
pounds
would
be
a
godsend
just
then
and
he
thought
the
fates
owed
him
something
he
told
mildred
what
he
had
done
when
he
saw
her
at
breakfast
next
morning
she
thought
him
very
silly
i
never
knew
anyone
who
made
money
on
the
stock
exchange
she
said
thats
what
emil
always
said
you
cant
expect
to
make
money
on
the
stock
exchange
he
said
philip
bought
an
evening
paper
on
his
way
home
and
turned
at
once
to
the
money
columns
he
knew
nothing
about
these
things
and
had
difficulty
in
finding
the
stock
which
macalister
had
spoken
of
he
saw
they
had
advanced
a
quarter
his
heart
leaped
and
then
he
felt
sick
with
apprehension
in
case
macalister
had
forgotten
or
for
some
reason
had
not
bought
macalister
had
promised
to
telegraph
philip
could
not
wait
to
take
a
tram
home
he
jumped
into
a
cab
it
was
an
unwonted
extravagance
is
there
a
telegram
for
me
he
said
as
he
burst
in
no
said
mildred
his
face
fell
and
in
bitter
disappointment
he
sank
heavily
into
a
chair
then
he
didnt
buy
them
for
me
after
all
curse
him
he
added
violently
what
cruel
luck
and
ive
been
thinking
all
day
of
what
id
do
with
the
money
why
what
were
you
going
to
do
she
asked
whats
the
good
of
thinking
about
that
now
oh
i
wanted
the
money
so
badly
she
gave
a
laugh
and
handed
him
a
telegram
i
was
only
having
a
joke
with
you
i
opened
it
he
tore
it
out
of
her
hands
macalister
had
bought
him
two
hundred
and
fifty
shares
and
sold
them
at
the
halfcrown
profit
he
had
suggested
the
commission
note
was
to
follow
next
day
for
one
moment
philip
was
furious
with
mildred
for
her
cruel
jest
but
then
he
could
only
think
of
his
joy
it
makes
such
a
difference
to
me
he
cried
ill
stand
you
a
new
dress
if
you
like
i
want
it
badly
enough
she
answered
ill
tell
you
what
im
going
to
do
im
going
to
be
operated
upon
at
the
end
of
july
why
have
you
got
something
the
matter
with
you
she
interrupted
it
struck
her
that
an
illness
she
did
not
know
might
explain
what
had
so
much
puzzled
her
he
flushed
for
he
hated
to
refer
to
his
deformity
no
but
they
think
they
can
do
something
to
my
foot
i
couldnt
spare
the
time
before
but
now
it
doesnt
matter
so
much
i
shall
start
my
dressing
in
october
instead
of
next
month
i
shall
only
be
in
hospital
a
few
weeks
and
then
we
can
go
away
to
the
seaside
for
the
rest
of
the
summer
itll
do
us
all
good
you
and
the
baby
and
me
oh
lets
go
to
brighton
philip
i
like
brighton
you
get
such
a
nice
class
of
people
there
philip
had
vaguely
thought
of
some
little
fishing
village
in
cornwall
but
as
she
spoke
it
occurred
to
him
that
mildred
would
be
bored
to
death
there
i
dont
mind
where
we
go
as
long
as
i
get
the
sea
he
did
not
know
why
but
he
had
suddenly
an
irresistible
longing
for
the
sea
he
wanted
to
bathe
and
he
thought
with
delight
of
splashing
about
in
the
salt
water
he
was
a
good
swimmer
and
nothing
exhilarated
him
like
a
rough
sea
i
say
it
will
be
jolly
he
cried
itll
be
like
a
honeymoon
wont
it
she
said
how
much
can
i
have
for
my
new
dress
phil
chapter
xciv
philip
asked
mr
jacobs
the
assistantsurgeon
for
whom
he
had
dressed
to
do
the
operation
jacobs
accepted
with
pleasure
since
he
was
interested
just
then
in
neglected
talipes
and
was
getting
together
materials
for
a
paper
he
warned
philip
that
he
could
not
make
his
foot
like
the
other
but
he
thought
he
could
do
a
good
deal
and
though
he
would
always
limp
he
would
be
able
to
wear
a
boot
less
unsightly
than
that
which
he
had
been
accustomed
to
philip
remembered
how
he
had
prayed
to
a
god
who
was
able
to
remove
mountains
for
him
who
had
faith
and
he
smiled
bitterly
i
dont
expect
a
miracle
he
answered
i
think
youre
wise
to
let
me
try
what
i
can
do
youll
find
a
clubfoot
rather
a
handicap
in
practice
the
layman
is
full
of
fads
and
he
doesnt
like
his
doctor
to
have
anything
the
matter
with
him
philip
went
into
a
small
ward
which
was
a
room
on
the
landing
outside
each
ward
reserved
for
special
cases
he
remained
there
a
month
for
the
surgeon
would
not
let
him
go
till
he
could
walk
and
bearing
the
operation
very
well
he
had
a
pleasant
enough
time
lawson
and
athelny
came
to
see
him
and
one
day
mrs
athelny
brought
two
of
her
children
students
whom
he
knew
looked
in
now
and
again
to
have
a
chat
mildred
came
twice
a
week
everyone
was
very
kind
to
him
and
philip
always
surprised
when
anyone
took
trouble
with
him
was
touched
and
grateful
he
enjoyed
the
relief
from
care
he
need
not
worry
there
about
the
future
neither
whether
his
money
would
last
out
nor
whether
he
would
pass
his
final
examinations
and
he
could
read
to
his
hearts
content
he
had
not
been
able
to
read
much
of
late
since
mildred
disturbed
him
she
would
make
an
aimless
remark
when
he
was
trying
to
concentrate
his
attention
and
would
not
be
satisfied
unless
he
answered
whenever
he
was
comfortably
settled
down
with
a
book
she
would
want
something
done
and
would
come
to
him
with
a
cork
she
could
not
draw
or
a
hammer
to
drive
in
a
nail
they
settled
to
go
to
brighton
in
august
philip
wanted
to
take
lodgings
but
mildred
said
that
she
would
have
to
do
housekeeping
and
it
would
only
be
a
holiday
for
her
if
they
went
to
a
boardinghouse
i
have
to
see
about
the
food
every
day
at
home
i
get
that
sick
of
it
i
want
a
thorough
change
philip
agreed
and
it
happened
that
mildred
knew
of
a
boardinghouse
at
kemp
town
where
they
would
not
be
charged
more
than
twentyfive
shillings
a
week
each
she
arranged
with
philip
to
write
about
rooms
but
when
he
got
back
to
kennington
he
found
that
she
had
done
nothing
he
was
irritated
i
shouldnt
have
thought
you
had
so
much
to
do
as
all
that
he
said
well
i
cant
think
of
everything
its
not
my
fault
if
i
forget
is
it
philip
was
so
anxious
to
get
to
the
sea
that
he
would
not
wait
to
communicate
with
the
mistress
of
the
boardinghouse
well
leave
the
luggage
at
the
station
and
go
to
the
house
and
see
if
theyve
got
rooms
and
if
they
have
we
can
just
send
an
outside
porter
for
our
traps
you
can
please
yourself
said
mildred
stiffly
she
did
not
like
being
reproached
and
retiring
huffily
into
a
haughty
silence
she
sat
by
listlessly
while
philip
made
the
preparations
for
their
departure
the
little
flat
was
hot
and
stuffy
under
the
august
sun
and
from
the
road
beat
up
a
malodorous
sultriness
as
he
lay
in
his
bed
in
the
small
ward
with
its
red
distempered
walls
he
had
longed
for
fresh
air
and
the
splashing
of
the
sea
against
his
breast
he
felt
he
would
go
mad
if
he
had
to
spend
another
night
in
london
mildred
recovered
her
good
temper
when
she
saw
the
streets
of
brighton
crowded
with
people
making
holiday
and
they
were
both
in
high
spirits
as
they
drove
out
to
kemp
town
philip
stroked
the
babys
cheek
we
shall
get
a
very
different
colour
into
them
when
weve
been
down
here
a
few
days
he
said
smiling
they
arrived
at
the
boardinghouse
and
dismissed
the
cab
an
untidy
maid
opened
the
door
and
when
philip
asked
if
they
had
rooms
said
she
would
inquire
she
fetched
her
mistress
a
middleaged
woman
stout
and
businesslike
came
downstairs
gave
them
the
scrutinising
glance
of
her
profession
and
asked
what
accommodation
they
required
two
single
rooms
and
if
youve
got
such
a
thing
wed
rather
like
a
cot
in
one
of
them
im
afraid
i
havent
got
that
ive
got
one
nice
large
double
room
and
i
could
let
you
have
a
cot
i
dont
think
that
would
do
said
philip
i
could
give
you
another
room
next
week
brightons
very
full
just
now
and
people
have
to
take
what
they
can
get
if
it
were
only
for
a
few
days
philip
i
think
we
might
be
able
to
manage
said
mildred
i
think
two
rooms
would
be
more
convenient
can
you
recommend
any
other
place
where
they
take
boarders
i
can
but
i
dont
suppose
theyd
have
room
any
more
than
i
have
perhaps
you
wouldnt
mind
giving
me
the
address
the
house
the
stout
woman
suggested
was
in
the
next
street
and
they
walked
towards
it
philip
could
walk
quite
well
though
he
had
to
lean
on
a
stick
and
he
was
rather
weak
mildred
carried
the
baby
they
went
for
a
little
in
silence
and
then
he
saw
she
was
crying
it
annoyed
him
and
he
took
no
notice
but
she
forced
his
attention
lend
me
a
hanky
will
you
i
cant
get
at
mine
with
baby
she
said
in
a
voice
strangled
with
sobs
turning
her
head
away
from
him
he
gave
her
his
handkerchief
but
said
nothing
she
dried
her
eyes
and
as
he
did
not
speak
went
on
i
might
be
poisonous
please
dont
make
a
scene
in
the
street
he
said
itll
look
so
funny
insisting
on
separate
rooms
like
that
whatll
they
think
of
us
if
they
knew
the
circumstances
i
imagine
theyd
think
us
surprisingly
moral
said
philip
she
gave
him
a
sidelong
glance
youre
not
going
to
give
it
away
that
were
not
married
she
asked
quickly
no
why
wont
you
live
with
me
as
if
we
were
married
then
my
dear
i
cant
explain
i
dont
want
to
humiliate
you
but
i
simply
cant
i
daresay
its
very
silly
and
unreasonable
but
its
stronger
than
i
am
i
loved
you
so
much
that
now
he
broke
off
after
all
theres
no
accounting
for
that
sort
of
thing
a
fat
lot
you
must
have
loved
me
she
exclaimed
the
boardinghouse
to
which
they
had
been
directed
was
kept
by
a
bustling
maiden
lady
with
shrewd
eyes
and
voluble
speech
they
could
have
one
double
room
for
twentyfive
shillings
a
week
each
and
five
shillings
extra
for
the
baby
or
they
could
have
two
single
rooms
for
a
pound
a
week
more
i
have
to
charge
that
much
more
the
woman
explained
apologetically
because
if
im
pushed
to
it
i
can
put
two
beds
even
in
the
single
rooms
i
daresay
that
wont
ruin
us
what
do
you
think
mildred
oh
i
dont
mind
anythings
good
enough
for
me
she
answered
philip
passed
off
her
sulky
reply
with
a
laugh
and
the
landlady
having
arranged
to
send
for
their
luggage
they
sat
down
to
rest
themselves
philips
foot
was
hurting
him
a
little
and
he
was
glad
to
put
it
up
on
a
chair
i
suppose
you
dont
mind
my
sitting
in
the
same
room
with
you
said
mildred
aggressively
dont
lets
quarrel
mildred
he
said
gently
i
didnt
know
you
was
so
well
off
you
could
afford
to
throw
away
a
pound
a
week
dont
be
angry
with
me
i
assure
you
its
the
only
way
we
can
live
together
at
all
i
suppose
you
despise
me
thats
it
of
course
i
dont
why
should
i
its
so
unnatural
is
it
youre
not
in
love
with
me
are
you
me
who
dyou
take
me
for
its
not
as
if
you
were
a
very
passionate
woman
youre
not
that
its
so
humiliating
she
said
sulkily
oh
i
wouldnt
fuss
about
that
if
i
were
you
there
were
about
a
dozen
people
in
the
boardinghouse
they
ate
in
a
narrow
dark
room
at
a
long
table
at
the
head
of
which
the
landlady
sat
and
carved
the
food
was
bad
the
landlady
called
it
french
cooking
by
which
she
meant
that
the
poor
quality
of
the
materials
was
disguised
by
illmade
sauces
plaice
masqueraded
as
sole
and
new
zealand
mutton
as
lamb
the
kitchen
was
small
and
inconvenient
so
that
everything
was
served
up
lukewarm
the
people
were
dull
and
pretentious
old
ladies
with
elderly
maiden
daughters
funny
old
bachelors
with
mincing
ways
palefaced
middleaged
clerks
with
wives
who
talked
of
their
married
daughters
and
their
sons
who
were
in
a
very
good
position
in
the
colonies
at
table
they
discussed
miss
corells
latest
novel
some
of
them
liked
lord
leighton
better
than
mr
almatadema
and
some
of
them
liked
mr
almatadema
better
than
lord
leighton
mildred
soon
told
the
ladies
of
her
romantic
marriage
with
philip
and
he
found
himself
an
object
of
interest
because
his
family
county
people
in
a
very
good
position
had
cut
him
off
with
a
shilling
because
he
married
while
he
was
only
a
stoodent
and
mildreds
father
who
had
a
large
place
down
devonshire
way
wouldnt
do
anything
for
them
because
she
had
married
philip
that
was
why
they
had
come
to
a
boardinghouse
and
had
not
a
nurse
for
the
baby
but
they
had
to
have
two
rooms
because
they
were
both
used
to
a
good
deal
of
accommodation
and
they
didnt
care
to
be
cramped
the
other
visitors
also
had
explanations
of
their
presence
one
of
the
single
gentlemen
generally
went
to
the
metropole
for
his
holiday
but
he
liked
cheerful
company
and
you
couldnt
get
that
at
one
of
those
expensive
hotels
and
the
old
lady
with
the
middleaged
daughter
was
having
her
beautiful
house
in
london
done
up
and
she
said
to
her
daughter
gwennie
my
dear
we
must
have
a
cheap
holiday
this
year
and
so
they
had
come
there
though
of
course
it
wasnt
at
all
the
kind
of
thing
they
were
used
to
mildred
found
them
all
very
superior
and
she
hated
a
lot
of
common
rough
people
she
liked
gentlemen
to
be
gentlemen
in
every
sense
of
the
word
when
people
are
gentlemen
and
ladies
she
said
i
like
them
to
be
gentlemen
and
ladies
the
remark
seemed
cryptic
to
philip
but
when
he
heard
her
say
it
two
or
three
times
to
different
persons
and
found
that
it
aroused
hearty
agreement
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
only
obscure
to
his
own
intelligence
it
was
the
first
time
that
philip
and
mildred
had
been
thrown
entirely
together
in
london
he
did
not
see
her
all
day
and
when
he
came
home
the
household
affairs
the
baby
the
neighbours
gave
them
something
to
talk
about
till
he
settled
down
to
work
now
he
spent
the
whole
day
with
her
after
breakfast
they
went
down
to
the
beach
the
morning
went
easily
enough
with
a
bathe
and
a
stroll
along
the
front
the
evening
which
they
spent
on
the
pier
having
put
the
baby
to
bed
was
tolerable
for
there
was
music
to
listen
to
and
a
constant
stream
of
people
to
look
at
philip
amused
himself
by
imagining
who
they
were
and
weaving
little
stories
about
them
he
had
got
into
the
habit
of
answering
mildreds
remarks
with
his
mouth
only
so
that
his
thoughts
remained
undisturbed
but
the
afternoons
were
long
and
dreary
they
sat
on
the
beach
mildred
said
they
must
get
all
the
benefit
they
could
out
of
doctor
brighton
and
he
could
not
read
because
mildred
made
observations
frequently
about
things
in
general
if
he
paid
no
attention
she
complained
oh
leave
that
silly
old
book
alone
it
cant
be
good
for
you
always
reading
youll
addle
your
brain
thats
what
youll
do
philip
oh
rot
he
answered
besides
its
so
unsociable
he
discovered
that
it
was
difficult
to
talk
to
her
she
had
not
even
the
power
of
attending
to
what
she
was
herself
saying
so
that
a
dog
running
in
front
of
her
or
the
passing
of
a
man
in
a
loud
blazer
would
call
forth
a
remark
and
then
she
would
forget
what
she
had
been
speaking
of
she
had
a
bad
memory
for
names
and
it
irritated
her
not
to
be
able
to
think
of
them
so
that
she
would
pause
in
the
middle
of
some
story
to
rack
her
brains
sometimes
she
had
to
give
it
up
but
it
often
occurred
to
her
afterwards
and
when
philip
was
talking
of
something
she
would
interrupt
him
collins
that
was
it
i
knew
it
would
come
back
to
me
some
time
collins
thats
the
name
i
couldnt
remember
it
exasperated
him
because
it
showed
that
she
was
not
listening
to
anything
he
said
and
yet
if
he
was
silent
she
reproached
him
for
sulkiness
her
mind
was
of
an
order
that
could
not
deal
for
five
minutes
with
the
abstract
and
when
philip
gave
way
to
his
taste
for
generalising
she
very
quickly
showed
that
she
was
bored
mildred
dreamt
a
great
deal
and
she
had
an
accurate
memory
for
her
dreams
which
she
would
relate
every
day
with
prolixity
one
morning
he
received
a
long
letter
from
thorpe
athelny
he
was
taking
his
holiday
in
the
theatrical
way
in
which
there
was
much
sound
sense
which
characterised
him
he
had
done
the
same
thing
for
ten
years
he
took
his
whole
family
to
a
hopfield
in
kent
not
far
from
mrs
athelnys
home
and
they
spent
three
weeks
hopping
it
kept
them
in
the
open
air
earned
them
money
much
to
mrs
athelnys
satisfaction
and
renewed
their
contact
with
mother
earth
it
was
upon
this
that
athelny
laid
stress
the
sojourn
in
the
fields
gave
them
a
new
strength
it
was
like
a
magic
ceremony
by
which
they
renewed
their
youth
and
the
power
of
their
limbs
and
the
sweetness
of
the
spirit
philip
had
heard
him
say
many
fantastic
rhetorical
and
picturesque
things
on
the
subject
now
athelny
invited
him
to
come
over
for
a
day
he
had
certain
meditations
on
shakespeare
and
the
musical
glasses
which
he
desired
to
impart
and
the
children
were
clamouring
for
a
sight
of
uncle
philip
philip
read
the
letter
again
in
the
afternoon
when
he
was
sitting
with
mildred
on
the
beach
he
thought
of
mrs
athelny
cheerful
mother
of
many
children
with
her
kindly
hospitality
and
her
good
humour
of
sally
grave
for
her
years
with
funny
little
maternal
ways
and
an
air
of
authority
with
her
long
plait
of
fair
hair
and
her
broad
forehead
and
then
in
a
bunch
of
all
the
others
merry
boisterous
healthy
and
handsome
his
heart
went
out
to
them
there
was
one
quality
which
they
had
that
he
did
not
remember
to
have
noticed
in
people
before
and
that
was
goodness
it
had
not
occurred
to
him
till
now
but
it
was
evidently
the
beauty
of
their
goodness
which
attracted
him
in
theory
he
did
not
believe
in
it
if
morality
were
no
more
than
a
matter
of
convenience
good
and
evil
had
no
meaning
he
did
not
like
to
be
illogical
but
here
was
simple
goodness
natural
and
without
effort
and
he
thought
it
beautiful
meditating
he
slowly
tore
the
letter
into
little
pieces
he
did
not
see
how
he
could
go
without
mildred
and
he
did
not
want
to
go
with
her
it
was
very
hot
the
sky
was
cloudless
and
they
had
been
driven
to
a
shady
corner
the
baby
was
gravely
playing
with
stones
on
the
beach
and
now
and
then
she
crawled
up
to
philip
and
gave
him
one
to
hold
then
took
it
away
again
and
placed
it
carefully
down
she
was
playing
a
mysterious
and
complicated
game
known
only
to
herself
mildred
was
asleep
she
lay
with
her
head
thrown
back
and
her
mouth
slightly
open
her
legs
were
stretched
out
and
her
boots
protruded
from
her
petticoats
in
a
grotesque
fashion
his
eyes
had
been
resting
on
her
vaguely
but
now
he
looked
at
her
with
peculiar
attention
he
remembered
how
passionately
he
had
loved
her
and
he
wondered
why
now
he
was
entirely
indifferent
to
her
the
change
in
him
filled
him
with
dull
pain
it
seemed
to
him
that
all
he
had
suffered
had
been
sheer
waste
the
touch
of
her
hand
had
filled
him
with
ecstasy
he
had
desired
to
enter
into
her
soul
so
that
he
could
share
every
thought
with
her
and
every
feeling
he
had
suffered
acutely
because
when
silence
had
fallen
between
them
a
remark
of
hers
showed
how
far
their
thoughts
had
travelled
apart
and
he
had
rebelled
against
the
unsurmountable
wall
which
seemed
to
divide
every
personality
from
every
other
he
found
it
strangely
tragic
that
he
had
loved
her
so
madly
and
now
loved
her
not
at
all
sometimes
he
hated
her
she
was
incapable
of
learning
and
the
experience
of
life
had
taught
her
nothing
she
was
as
unmannerly
as
she
had
always
been
it
revolted
philip
to
hear
the
insolence
with
which
she
treated
the
hardworked
servant
at
the
boardinghouse
presently
he
considered
his
own
plans
at
the
end
of
his
fourth
year
he
would
be
able
to
take
his
examination
in
midwifery
and
a
year
more
would
see
him
qualified
then
he
might
manage
a
journey
to
spain
he
wanted
to
see
the
pictures
which
he
knew
only
from
photographs
he
felt
deeply
that
el
greco
held
a
secret
of
peculiar
moment
to
him
and
he
fancied
that
in
toledo
he
would
surely
find
it
out
he
did
not
wish
to
do
things
grandly
and
on
a
hundred
pounds
he
might
live
for
six
months
in
spain
if
macalister
put
him
on
to
another
good
thing
he
could
make
that
easily
his
heart
warmed
at
the
thought
of
those
old
beautiful
cities
and
the
tawny
plains
of
castile
he
was
convinced
that
more
might
be
got
out
of
life
than
offered
itself
at
present
and
he
thought
that
in
spain
he
could
live
with
greater
intensity
it
might
be
possible
to
practise
in
one
of
those
old
cities
there
were
a
good
many
foreigners
passing
or
resident
and
he
should
be
able
to
pick
up
a
living
but
that
would
be
much
later
first
he
must
get
one
or
two
hospital
appointments
they
gave
experience
and
made
it
easy
to
get
jobs
afterwards
he
wished
to
get
a
berth
as
ships
doctor
on
one
of
the
large
tramps
that
took
things
leisurely
enough
for
a
man
to
see
something
of
the
places
at
which
they
stopped
he
wanted
to
go
to
the
east
and
his
fancy
was
rich
with
pictures
of
bangkok
and
shanghai
and
the
ports
of
japan
he
pictured
to
himself
palmtrees
and
skies
blue
and
hot
darkskinned
people
pagodas
the
scents
of
the
orient
intoxicated
his
nostrils
his
heart
but
with
passionate
desire
for
the
beauty
and
the
strangeness
of
the
world
mildred
awoke
i
do
believe
ive
been
asleep
she
said
now
then
you
naughty
girl
what
have
you
been
doing
to
yourself
her
dress
was
clean
yesterday
and
just
look
at
it
now
philip
chapter
xcv
when
they
returned
to
london
philip
began
his
dressing
in
the
surgical
wards
he
was
not
so
much
interested
in
surgery
as
in
medicine
which
a
more
empirical
science
offered
greater
scope
to
the
imagination
the
work
was
a
little
harder
than
the
corresponding
work
on
the
medical
side
there
was
a
lecture
from
nine
till
ten
when
he
went
into
the
wards
there
wounds
had
to
be
dressed
stitches
taken
out
bandages
renewed
philip
prided
himself
a
little
on
his
skill
in
bandaging
and
it
amused
him
to
wring
a
word
of
approval
from
a
nurse
on
certain
afternoons
in
the
week
there
were
operations
and
he
stood
in
the
well
of
the
theatre
in
a
white
jacket
ready
to
hand
the
operating
surgeon
any
instrument
he
wanted
or
to
sponge
the
blood
away
so
that
he
could
see
what
he
was
about
when
some
rare
operation
was
to
be
performed
the
theatre
would
fill
up
but
generally
there
were
not
more
than
half
a
dozen
students
present
and
then
the
proceedings
had
a
cosiness
which
philip
enjoyed
at
that
time
the
world
at
large
seemed
to
have
a
passion
for
appendicitis
and
a
good
many
cases
came
to
the
operating
theatre
for
this
complaint
the
surgeon
for
whom
philip
dressed
was
in
friendly
rivalry
with
a
colleague
as
to
which
could
remove
an
appendix
in
the
shortest
time
and
with
the
smallest
incision
in
due
course
philip
was
put
on
accident
duty
the
dressers
took
this
in
turn
it
lasted
three
days
during
which
they
lived
in
hospital
and
ate
their
meals
in
the
commonroom
they
had
a
room
on
the
ground
floor
near
the
casualty
ward
with
a
bed
that
shut
up
during
the
day
into
a
cupboard
the
dresser
on
duty
had
to
be
at
hand
day
and
night
to
see
to
any
casualty
that
came
in
you
were
on
the
move
all
the
time
and
not
more
than
an
hour
or
two
passed
during
the
night
without
the
clanging
of
the
bell
just
above
your
head
which
made
you
leap
out
of
bed
instinctively
saturday
night
was
of
course
the
busiest
time
and
the
closing
of
the
publichouses
the
busiest
hour
men
would
be
brought
in
by
the
police
dead
drunk
and
it
would
be
necessary
to
administer
a
stomachpump
women
rather
the
worse
for
liquor
themselves
would
come
in
with
a
wound
on
the
head
or
a
bleeding
nose
which
their
husbands
had
given
them
some
would
vow
to
have
the
law
on
him
and
others
ashamed
would
declare
that
it
had
been
an
accident
what
the
dresser
could
manage
himself
he
did
but
if
there
was
anything
important
he
sent
for
the
housesurgeon
he
did
this
with
care
since
the
housesurgeon
was
not
vastly
pleased
to
be
dragged
down
five
flights
of
stairs
for
nothing
the
cases
ranged
from
a
cut
finger
to
a
cut
throat
boys
came
in
with
hands
mangled
by
some
machine
men
were
brought
who
had
been
knocked
down
by
a
cab
and
children
who
had
broken
a
limb
while
playing
now
and
then
attempted
suicides
were
carried
in
by
the
police
philip
saw
a
ghastly
wildeyed
man
with
a
great
gash
from
ear
to
ear
and
he
was
in
the
ward
for
weeks
afterwards
in
charge
of
a
constable
silent
angry
because
he
was
alive
and
sullen
he
made
no
secret
of
the
fact
that
he
would
try
again
to
kill
himself
as
soon
as
he
was
released
the
wards
were
crowded
and
the
housesurgeon
was
faced
with
a
dilemma
when
patients
were
brought
in
by
the
police
if
they
were
sent
on
to
the
station
and
died
there
disagreeable
things
were
said
in
the
papers
and
it
was
very
difficult
sometimes
to
tell
if
a
man
was
dying
or
drunk
philip
did
not
go
to
bed
till
he
was
tired
out
so
that
he
should
not
have
the
bother
of
getting
up
again
in
an
hour
and
he
sat
in
the
casualty
ward
talking
in
the
intervals
of
work
with
the
nightnurse
she
was
a
grayhaired
woman
of
masculine
appearance
who
had
been
nightnurse
in
the
casualty
department
for
twenty
years
she
liked
the
work
because
she
was
her
own
mistress
and
had
no
sister
to
bother
her
her
movements
were
slow
but
she
was
immensely
capable
and
she
never
failed
in
an
emergency
the
dressers
often
inexperienced
or
nervous
found
her
a
tower
of
strength
she
had
seen
thousands
of
them
and
they
made
no
impression
upon
her
she
always
called
them
mr
brown
and
when
they
expostulated
and
told
her
their
real
names
she
merely
nodded
and
went
on
calling
them
mr
brown
it
interested
philip
to
sit
with
her
in
the
bare
room
with
its
two
horsehair
couches
and
the
flaring
gas
and
listen
to
her
she
had
long
ceased
to
look
upon
the
people
who
came
in
as
human
beings
they
were
drunks
or
broken
arms
or
cut
throats
she
took
the
vice
and
misery
and
cruelty
of
the
world
as
a
matter
of
course
she
found
nothing
to
praise
or
blame
in
human
actions
she
accepted
she
had
a
certain
grim
humour
i
remember
one
suicide
she
said
to
philip
who
threw
himself
into
the
thames
they
fished
him
out
and
brought
him
here
and
ten
days
later
he
developed
typhoid
fever
from
swallowing
thames
water
did
he
die
yes
he
did
all
right
i
could
never
make
up
my
mind
if
it
was
suicide
or
not
theyre
a
funny
lot
suicides
i
remember
one
man
who
couldnt
get
any
work
to
do
and
his
wife
died
so
he
pawed
his
clothes
and
bought
a
revolver
but
he
made
a
mess
of
it
he
only
shot
out
an
eye
and
he
got
all
right
and
then
if
you
please
with
an
eye
gone
and
a
piece
of
his
face
blow
away
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
world
wasnt
such
a
bad
place
after
all
and
he
lived
happily
ever
afterwards
thing
ive
always
noticed
people
dont
commit
suicide
for
love
as
youd
expect
thats
just
a
fancy
of
novelists
they
commit
suicide
because
they
havent
got
any
money
i
wonder
why
that
is
i
suppose
moneys
more
important
than
love
suggested
philip
money
was
in
any
case
occupying
philips
thoughts
a
good
deal
just
then
he
discovered
the
little
truth
there
was
in
the
airy
saying
which
himself
had
repeated
that
two
could
live
as
cheaply
as
one
and
his
expenses
were
beginning
to
worry
him
mildred
was
not
a
good
manager
and
it
cost
them
as
much
to
live
as
if
they
had
eaten
in
restaurants
the
child
needed
clothes
and
mildred
boots
an
umbrella
and
other
small
things
which
it
was
impossible
for
her
to
do
without
when
they
returned
from
brighton
she
had
announced
her
intention
of
getting
a
job
but
she
took
no
definite
steps
and
presently
a
bad
cold
laid
her
up
for
a
fortnight
when
she
was
well
she
answered
one
or
two
advertisements
but
nothing
came
of
it
either
she
arrived
too
late
and
the
vacant
place
was
filled
or
the
work
was
more
than
she
felt
strong
enough
to
do
once
she
got
an
offer
but
the
wages
were
only
fourteen
shillings
a
week
and
she
thought
she
was
worth
more
than
that
its
no
good
letting
oneself
be
put
upon
she
remarked
people
dont
respect
you
if
you
let
yourself
go
too
cheap
i
dont
think
fourteen
shillings
is
so
bad
answered
philip
drily
he
could
not
help
thinking
how
useful
it
would
be
towards
the
expenses
of
the
household
and
mildred
was
already
beginning
to
hint
that
she
did
not
get
a
place
because
she
had
not
got
a
decent
dress
to
interview
employers
in
he
gave
her
the
dress
and
she
made
one
or
two
more
attempts
but
philip
came
to
the
conclusion
that
they
were
not
serious
she
did
not
want
to
work
the
only
way
he
knew
to
make
money
was
on
the
stock
exchange
and
he
was
very
anxious
to
repeat
the
lucky
experiment
of
the
summer
but
war
had
broken
out
with
the
transvaal
and
nothing
was
doing
in
south
africans
macalister
told
him
that
redvers
buller
would
march
into
pretoria
in
a
month
and
then
everything
would
boom
the
only
thing
was
to
wait
patiently
what
they
wanted
was
a
british
reverse
to
knock
things
down
a
bit
and
then
it
might
be
worth
while
buying
philip
began
reading
assiduously
the
city
chat
of
his
favourite
newspaper
he
was
worried
and
irritable
once
or
twice
he
spoke
sharply
to
mildred
and
since
she
was
neither
tactful
nor
patient
she
answered
with
temper
and
they
quarrelled
philip
always
expressed
his
regret
for
what
he
had
said
but
mildred
had
not
a
forgiving
nature
and
she
would
sulk
for
a
couple
of
days
she
got
on
his
nerves
in
all
sorts
of
ways
by
the
manner
in
which
she
ate
and
by
the
untidiness
which
made
her
leave
articles
of
clothing
about
their
sittingroom
philip
was
excited
by
the
war
and
devoured
the
papers
morning
and
evening
but
she
took
no
interest
in
anything
that
happened
she
had
made
the
acquaintance
of
two
or
three
people
who
lived
in
the
street
and
one
of
them
had
asked
if
she
would
like
the
curate
to
call
on
her
she
wore
a
weddingring
and
called
herself
mrs
carey
on
philips
walls
were
two
or
three
of
the
drawings
which
he
had
made
in
paris
nudes
two
of
women
and
one
of
miguel
ajuria
standing
very
square
on
his
feet
with
clenched
fists
philip
kept
them
because
they
were
the
best
things
he
had
done
and
they
reminded
him
of
happy
days
mildred
had
long
looked
at
them
with
disfavour
i
wish
youd
take
those
drawings
down
philip
she
said
to
him
at
last
mrs
foreman
of
number
thirteen
came
in
yesterday
afternoon
and
i
didnt
know
which
way
to
look
i
saw
her
staring
at
them
whats
the
matter
with
them
theyre
indecent
disgusting
thats
what
i
call
it
to
have
drawings
of
naked
people
about
and
it
isnt
nice
for
baby
either
shes
beginning
to
notice
things
now
how
can
you
be
so
vulgar
vulgar
modest
i
call
it
ive
never
said
anything
but
dyou
think
i
like
having
to
look
at
those
naked
people
all
day
long
have
you
no
sense
of
humour
at
all
mildred
he
asked
frigidly
i
dont
know
what
sense
of
humours
got
to
do
with
it
ive
got
a
good
mind
to
take
them
down
myself
if
you
want
to
know
what
i
think
about
them
i
think
theyre
disgusting
i
dont
want
to
know
what
you
think
about
them
and
i
forbid
you
to
touch
them
when
mildred
was
cross
with
him
she
punished
him
through
the
baby
the
little
girl
was
as
fond
of
philip
as
he
was
of
her
and
it
was
her
great
pleasure
every
morning
to
crawl
into
his
room
she
was
getting
on
for
two
now
and
could
walk
pretty
well
and
be
taken
up
into
his
bed
when
mildred
stopped
this
the
poor
child
would
cry
bitterly
to
philips
remonstrances
she
replied
i
dont
want
her
to
get
into
habits
and
if
then
he
said
anything
more
she
said
its
nothing
to
do
with
you
what
i
do
with
my
child
to
hear
you
talk
one
would
think
you
was
her
father
im
her
mother
and
i
ought
to
know
whats
good
for
her
oughtnt
i
philip
was
exasperated
by
mildreds
stupidity
but
he
was
so
indifferent
to
her
now
that
it
was
only
at
times
she
made
him
angry
he
grew
used
to
having
her
about
christmas
came
and
with
it
a
couple
of
days
holiday
for
philip
he
brought
some
holly
in
and
decorated
the
flat
and
on
christmas
day
he
gave
small
presents
to
mildred
and
the
baby
there
were
only
two
of
them
so
they
could
not
have
a
turkey
but
mildred
roasted
a
chicken
and
boiled
a
christmas
pudding
which
she
had
bought
at
a
local
grocers
they
stood
themselves
a
bottle
of
wine
when
they
had
dined
philip
sat
in
his
armchair
by
the
fire
smoking
his
pipe
and
the
unaccustomed
wine
had
made
him
forget
for
a
while
the
anxiety
about
money
which
was
so
constantly
with
him
he
felt
happy
and
comfortable
presently
mildred
came
in
to
tell
him
that
the
baby
wanted
him
to
kiss
her
goodnight
and
with
a
smile
he
went
into
mildreds
bedroom
then
telling
the
child
to
go
to
sleep
he
turned
down
the
gas
and
leaving
the
door
open
in
case
she
cried
went
back
into
the
sittingroom
where
are
you
going
to
sit
he
asked
mildred
you
sit
in
your
chair
im
going
to
sit
on
the
floor
when
he
sat
down
she
settled
herself
in
front
of
the
fire
and
leaned
against
his
knees
he
could
not
help
remembering
that
this
was
how
they
had
sat
together
in
her
rooms
in
the
vauxhall
bridge
road
but
the
positions
had
been
reversed
it
was
he
who
had
sat
on
the
floor
and
leaned
his
head
against
her
knee
how
passionately
he
had
loved
her
then
now
he
felt
for
her
a
tenderness
he
had
not
known
for
a
long
time
he
seemed
still
to
feel
twined
round
his
neck
the
babys
soft
little
arms
are
you
comfy
he
asked
she
looked
up
at
him
gave
a
slight
smile
and
nodded
they
gazed
into
the
fire
dreamily
without
speaking
to
one
another
at
last
she
turned
round
and
stared
at
him
curiously
dyou
know
that
you
havent
kissed
me
once
since
i
came
here
she
said
suddenly
dyou
want
me
to
he
smiled
i
suppose
you
dont
care
for
me
in
that
way
any
more
im
very
fond
of
you
youre
much
fonder
of
baby
he
did
not
answer
and
she
laid
her
cheek
against
his
hand
youre
not
angry
with
me
any
more
she
asked
presently
with
her
eyes
cast
down
why
on
earth
should
i
be
ive
never
cared
for
you
as
i
do
now
its
only
since
i
passed
through
the
fire
that
ive
learnt
to
love
you
it
chilled
philip
to
hear
her
make
use
of
the
sort
of
phrase
she
read
in
the
penny
novelettes
which
she
devoured
then
he
wondered
whether
what
she
said
had
any
meaning
for
her
perhaps
she
knew
no
other
way
to
express
her
genuine
feelings
than
the
stilted
language
of
the
family
herald
it
seems
so
funny
our
living
together
like
this
he
did
not
reply
for
quite
a
long
time
and
silence
fell
upon
them
again
but
at
last
he
spoke
and
seemed
conscious
of
no
interval
you
mustnt
be
angry
with
me
one
cant
help
these
things
i
remember
that
i
thought
you
wicked
and
cruel
because
you
did
this
that
and
the
other
but
it
was
very
silly
of
me
you
didnt
love
me
and
it
was
absurd
to
blame
you
for
that
i
thought
i
could
make
you
love
me
but
i
know
now
that
was
impossible
i
dont
know
what
it
is
that
makes
someone
love
you
but
whatever
it
is
its
the
only
thing
that
matters
and
if
it
isnt
there
you
wont
create
it
by
kindness
or
generosity
or
anything
of
that
sort
i
should
have
thought
if
youd
loved
me
really
youd
have
loved
me
still
i
should
have
thought
so
too
i
remember
how
i
used
to
think
that
it
would
last
for
ever
i
felt
i
would
rather
die
than
be
without
you
and
i
used
to
long
for
the
time
when
you
would
be
faded
and
wrinkled
so
that
nobody
cared
for
you
any
more
and
i
should
have
you
all
to
myself
she
did
not
answer
and
presently
she
got
up
and
said
she
was
going
to
bed
she
gave
a
timid
little
smile
its
christmas
day
philip
wont
you
kiss
me
goodnight
he
gave
a
laugh
blushed
slightly
and
kissed
her
she
went
to
her
bedroom
and
he
began
to
read
chapter
xcvi
the
climax
came
two
or
three
weeks
later
mildred
was
driven
by
philips
behaviour
to
a
pitch
of
strange
exasperation
there
were
many
different
emotions
in
her
soul
and
she
passed
from
mood
to
mood
with
facility
she
spent
a
great
deal
of
time
alone
and
brooded
over
her
position
she
did
not
put
all
her
feelings
into
words
she
did
not
even
know
what
they
were
but
certain
things
stood
out
in
her
mind
and
she
thought
of
them
over
and
over
again
she
had
never
understood
philip
nor
had
very
much
liked
him
but
she
was
pleased
to
have
him
about
her
because
she
thought
he
was
a
gentleman
she
was
impressed
because
his
father
had
been
a
doctor
and
his
uncle
was
a
clergyman
she
despised
him
a
little
because
she
had
made
such
a
fool
of
him
and
at
the
same
time
was
never
quite
comfortable
in
his
presence
she
could
not
let
herself
go
and
she
felt
that
he
was
criticising
her
manners
when
she
first
came
to
live
in
the
little
rooms
in
kennington
she
was
tired
out
and
ashamed
she
was
glad
to
be
left
alone
it
was
a
comfort
to
think
that
there
was
no
rent
to
pay
she
need
not
go
out
in
all
weathers
and
she
could
lie
quietly
in
bed
if
she
did
not
feel
well
she
had
hated
the
life
she
led
it
was
horrible
to
have
to
be
affable
and
subservient
and
even
now
when
it
crossed
her
mind
she
cried
with
pity
for
herself
as
she
thought
of
the
roughness
of
men
and
their
brutal
language
but
it
crossed
her
mind
very
seldom
she
was
grateful
to
philip
for
coming
to
her
rescue
and
when
she
remembered
how
honestly
he
had
loved
her
and
how
badly
she
had
treated
him
she
felt
a
pang
of
remorse
it
was
easy
to
make
it
up
to
him
it
meant
very
little
to
her
she
was
surprised
when
he
refused
her
suggestion
but
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
let
him
put
on
airs
if
he
liked
she
did
not
care
he
would
be
anxious
enough
in
a
little
while
and
then
it
would
be
her
turn
to
refuse
if
he
thought
it
was
any
deprivation
to
her
he
was
very
much
mistaken
she
had
no
doubt
of
her
power
over
him
he
was
peculiar
but
she
knew
him
through
and
through
he
had
so
often
quarrelled
with
her
and
sworn
he
would
never
see
her
again
and
then
in
a
little
while
he
had
come
on
his
knees
begging
to
be
forgiven
it
gave
her
a
thrill
to
think
how
he
had
cringed
before
her
he
would
have
been
glad
to
lie
down
on
the
ground
for
her
to
walk
on
him
she
had
seen
him
cry
she
knew
exactly
how
to
treat
him
pay
no
attention
to
him
just
pretend
you
didnt
notice
his
tempers
leave
him
severely
alone
and
in
a
little
while
he
was
sure
to
grovel
she
laughed
a
little
to
herself
goodhumouredly
when
she
thought
how
he
had
come
and
eaten
dirt
before
her
she
had
had
her
fling
now
she
knew
what
men
were
and
did
not
want
to
have
anything
more
to
do
with
them
she
was
quite
ready
to
settle
down
with
philip
when
all
was
said
he
was
a
gentleman
in
every
sense
of
the
word
and
that
was
something
not
to
be
sneezed
at
wasnt
it
anyhow
she
was
in
no
hurry
and
she
was
not
going
to
take
the
first
step
she
was
glad
to
see
how
fond
he
was
growing
of
the
baby
though
it
tickled
her
a
good
deal
it
was
comic
that
he
should
set
so
much
store
on
another
mans
child
he
was
peculiar
and
no
mistake
but
one
or
two
things
surprised
her
she
had
been
used
to
his
subservience
he
was
only
too
glad
to
do
anything
for
her
in
the
old
days
she
was
accustomed
to
see
him
cast
down
by
a
cross
word
and
in
ecstasy
at
a
kind
one
he
was
different
now
and
she
said
to
herself
that
he
had
not
improved
in
the
last
year
it
never
struck
her
for
a
moment
that
there
could
be
any
change
in
his
feelings
and
she
thought
it
was
only
acting
when
he
paid
no
heed
to
her
bad
temper
he
wanted
to
read
sometimes
and
told
her
to
stop
talking
she
did
not
know
whether
to
flare
up
or
to
sulk
and
was
so
puzzled
that
she
did
neither
then
came
the
conversation
in
which
he
told
her
that
he
intended
their
relations
to
be
platonic
and
remembering
an
incident
of
their
common
past
it
occurred
to
her
that
he
dreaded
the
possibility
of
her
being
pregnant
she
took
pains
to
reassure
him
it
made
no
difference
she
was
the
sort
of
woman
who
was
unable
to
realise
that
a
man
might
not
have
her
own
obsession
with
sex
her
relations
with
men
had
been
purely
on
those
lines
and
she
could
not
understand
that
they
ever
had
other
interests
the
thought
struck
her
that
philip
was
in
love
with
somebody
else
and
she
watched
him
suspecting
nurses
at
the
hospital
or
people
he
met
out
but
artful
questions
led
her
to
the
conclusion
that
there
was
no
one
dangerous
in
the
athelny
household
and
it
forced
itself
upon
her
also
that
philip
like
most
medical
students
was
unconscious
of
the
sex
of
the
nurses
with
whom
his
work
threw
him
in
contact
they
were
associated
in
his
mind
with
a
faint
odour
of
iodoform
philip
received
no
letters
and
there
was
no
girls
photograph
among
his
belongings
if
he
was
in
love
with
someone
he
was
very
clever
at
hiding
it
and
he
answered
all
mildreds
questions
with
frankness
and
apparently
without
suspicion
that
there
was
any
motive
in
them
i
dont
believe
hes
in
love
with
anybody
else
she
said
to
herself
at
last
it
was
a
relief
for
in
that
case
he
was
certainly
still
in
love
with
her
but
it
made
his
behaviour
very
puzzling
if
he
was
going
to
treat
her
like
that
why
did
he
ask
her
to
come
and
live
at
the
flat
it
was
unnatural
mildred
was
not
a
woman
who
conceived
the
possibility
of
compassion
generosity
or
kindness
her
only
conclusion
was
that
philip
was
queer
she
took
it
into
her
head
that
the
reasons
for
his
conduct
were
chivalrous
and
her
imagination
filled
with
the
extravagances
of
cheap
fiction
she
pictured
to
herself
all
sorts
of
romantic
explanations
for
his
delicacy
her
fancy
ran
riot
with
bitter
misunderstandings
purifications
by
fire
snowwhite
souls
and
death
in
the
cruel
cold
of
a
christmas
night
she
made
up
her
mind
that
when
they
went
to
brighton
she
would
put
an
end
to
all
his
nonsense
they
would
be
alone
there
everyone
would
think
them
husband
and
wife
and
there
would
be
the
pier
and
the
band
when
she
found
that
nothing
would
induce
philip
to
share
the
same
room
with
her
when
he
spoke
to
her
about
it
with
a
tone
in
his
voice
she
had
never
heard
before
she
suddenly
realised
that
he
did
not
want
her
she
was
astounded
she
remembered
all
he
had
said
in
the
past
and
how
desperately
he
had
loved
her
she
felt
humiliated
and
angry
but
she
had
a
sort
of
native
insolence
which
carried
her
through
he
neednt
think
she
was
in
love
with
him
because
she
wasnt
she
hated
him
sometimes
and
she
longed
to
humble
him
but
she
found
herself
singularly
powerless
she
did
not
know
which
way
to
handle
him
she
began
to
be
a
little
nervous
with
him
once
or
twice
she
cried
once
or
twice
she
set
herself
to
be
particularly
nice
to
him
but
when
she
took
his
arm
while
they
walked
along
the
front
at
night
he
made
some
excuse
in
a
while
to
release
himself
as
though
it
were
unpleasant
for
him
to
be
touched
by
her
she
could
not
make
it
out
the
only
hold
she
had
over
him
was
through
the
baby
of
whom
he
seemed
to
grow
fonder
and
fonder
she
could
make
him
white
with
anger
by
giving
the
child
a
slap
or
a
push
and
the
only
time
the
old
tender
smile
came
back
into
his
eyes
was
when
she
stood
with
the
baby
in
her
arms
she
noticed
it
when
she
was
being
photographed
like
that
by
a
man
on
the
beach
and
afterwards
she
often
stood
in
the
same
way
for
philip
to
look
at
her
when
they
got
back
to
london
mildred
began
looking
for
the
work
she
had
asserted
was
so
easy
to
find
she
wanted
now
to
be
independent
of
philip
and
she
thought
of
the
satisfaction
with
which
she
would
announce
to
him
that
she
was
going
into
rooms
and
would
take
the
child
with
her
but
her
heart
failed
her
when
she
came
into
closer
contact
with
the
possibility
she
had
grown
unused
to
the
long
hours
she
did
not
want
to
be
at
the
beck
and
call
of
a
manageress
and
her
dignity
revolted
at
the
thought
of
wearing
once
more
a
uniform
she
had
made
out
to
such
of
the
neighbours
as
she
knew
that
they
were
comfortably
off
it
would
be
a
comedown
if
they
heard
that
she
had
to
go
out
and
work
her
natural
indolence
asserted
itself
she
did
not
want
to
leave
philip
and
so
long
as
he
was
willing
to
provide
for
her
she
did
not
see
why
she
should
there
was
no
money
to
throw
away
but
she
got
her
board
and
lodging
and
he
might
get
better
off
his
uncle
was
an
old
man
and
might
die
any
day
he
would
come
into
a
little
then
and
even
as
things
were
it
was
better
than
slaving
from
morning
till
night
for
a
few
shillings
a
week
her
efforts
relaxed
she
kept
on
reading
the
advertisement
columns
of
the
daily
paper
merely
to
show
that
she
wanted
to
do
something
if
anything
that
was
worth
her
while
presented
itself
but
panic
seized
her
and
she
was
afraid
that
philip
would
grow
tired
of
supporting
her
she
had
no
hold
over
him
at
all
now
and
she
fancied
that
he
only
allowed
her
to
stay
there
because
he
was
fond
of
the
baby
she
brooded
over
it
all
and
she
thought
to
herself
angrily
that
she
would
make
him
pay
for
all
this
some
day
she
could
not
reconcile
herself
to
the
fact
that
he
no
longer
cared
for
her
she
would
make
him
she
suffered
from
pique
and
sometimes
in
a
curious
fashion
she
desired
philip
he
was
so
cold
now
that
it
exasperated
her
she
thought
of
him
in
that
way
incessantly
she
thought
that
he
was
treating
her
very
badly
and
she
did
not
know
what
she
had
done
to
deserve
it
she
kept
on
saying
to
herself
that
it
was
unnatural
they
should
live
like
that
then
she
thought
that
if
things
were
different
and
she
were
going
to
have
a
baby
he
would
be
sure
to
marry
her
he
was
funny
but
he
was
a
gentleman
in
every
sense
of
the
word
no
one
could
deny
that
at
last
it
became
an
obsession
with
her
and
she
made
up
her
mind
to
force
a
change
in
their
relations
he
never
even
kissed
her
now
and
she
wanted
him
to
she
remembered
how
ardently
he
had
been
used
to
press
her
lips
it
gave
her
a
curious
feeling
to
think
of
it
she
often
looked
at
his
mouth
one
evening
at
the
beginning
of
february
philip
told
her
that
he
was
dining
with
lawson
who
was
giving
a
party
in
his
studio
to
celebrate
his
birthday
and
he
would
not
be
in
till
late
lawson
had
bought
a
couple
of
bottles
of
the
punch
they
favoured
from
the
tavern
in
beak
street
and
they
proposed
to
have
a
merry
evening
mildred
asked
if
there
were
going
to
be
women
there
but
philip
told
her
there
were
not
only
men
had
been
invited
and
they
were
just
going
to
sit
and
talk
and
smoke
mildred
did
not
think
it
sounded
very
amusing
if
she
were
a
painter
she
would
have
half
a
dozen
models
about
she
went
to
bed
but
could
not
sleep
and
presently
an
idea
struck
her
she
got
up
and
fixed
the
catch
on
the
wicket
at
the
landing
so
that
philip
could
not
get
in
he
came
back
about
one
and
she
heard
him
curse
when
he
found
that
the
wicket
was
closed
she
got
out
of
bed
and
opened
why
on
earth
did
you
shut
yourself
in
im
sorry
ive
dragged
you
out
of
bed
i
left
it
open
on
purpose
i
cant
think
how
it
came
to
be
shut
hurry
up
and
get
back
to
bed
or
youll
catch
cold
he
walked
into
the
sittingroom
and
turned
up
the
gas
she
followed
him
in
she
went
up
to
the
fire
i
want
to
warm
my
feet
a
bit
theyre
like
ice
he
sat
down
and
began
to
take
off
his
boots
his
eyes
were
shining
and
his
cheeks
were
flushed
she
thought
he
had
been
drinking
have
you
been
enjoying
yourself
she
asked
with
a
smile
yes
ive
had
a
ripping
time
philip
was
quite
sober
but
he
had
been
talking
and
laughing
and
he
was
excited
still
an
evening
of
that
sort
reminded
him
of
the
old
days
in
paris
he
was
in
high
spirits
he
took
his
pipe
out
of
his
pocket
and
filled
it
arent
you
going
to
bed
she
asked
not
yet
im
not
a
bit
sleepy
lawson
was
in
great
form
he
talked
sixteen
to
the
dozen
from
the
moment
i
got
there
till
the
moment
i
left
what
did
you
talk
about
heaven
knows
of
every
subject
under
the
sun
you
should
have
seen
us
all
shouting
at
the
tops
of
our
voices
and
nobody
listening
philip
laughed
with
pleasure
at
the
recollection
and
mildred
laughed
too
she
was
pretty
sure
he
had
drunk
more
than
was
good
for
him
that
was
exactly
what
she
had
expected
she
knew
men
can
i
sit
down
she
said
before
he
could
answer
she
settled
herself
on
his
knees
if
youre
not
going
to
bed
youd
better
go
and
put
on
a
dressinggown
oh
im
all
right
as
i
am
then
putting
her
arms
round
his
neck
she
placed
her
face
against
his
and
said
why
are
you
so
horrid
to
me
phil
he
tried
to
get
up
but
she
would
not
let
him
i
do
love
you
philip
she
said
dont
talk
damned
rot
it
isnt
its
true
i
cant
live
without
you
i
want
you
he
released
himself
from
her
arms
please

up
youre
making
a
fool
of
yourself
and
youre
making
me
feel
a
perfect
idiot
i
love
you
philip
i
want
to
make
up
for
all
the
harm
i
did
you
i
cant
go
on
like
this
its
not
in
human
nature
he
slipped
out
of
the
chair
and
left
her
in
it
im
very
sorry
but
its
too
late
she
gave
a
heartrending
sob
but
why
how
can
you
be
so
cruel
i
suppose
its
because
i
loved
you
too
much
i
wore
the
passion
out
the
thought
of
anything
of
that
sort
horrifies
me
i
cant
look
at
you
now
without
thinking
of
emil
and
griffiths
one
cant
help
those
things
i
suppose
its
just
nerves
she
seized
his
hand
and
covered
it
with
kisses
dont
he
cried
she
sank
back
into
the
chair
i
cant
go
on
like
this
if
you
wont
love
me
id
rather
go
away
dont
be
foolish
you
havent
anywhere
to
go
you
can
stay
here
as
long
as
you
like
but
it
must
be
on
the
definite
understanding
that
were
friends
and
nothing
more
then
she
dropped
suddenly
the
vehemence
of
passion
and
gave
a
soft
insinuating
laugh
she
sidled
up
to
philip
and
put
her
arms
round
him
she
made
her
voice
low
and
wheedling
dont
be
such
an
old
silly
i
believe
youre
nervous
you
dont
know
how
nice
i
can
be
she
put
her
face
against
his
and
rubbed
his
cheek
with
hers
to
philip
her
smile
was
an
abominable
leer
and
the
suggestive
glitter
of
her
eyes
filled
him
with
horror
he
drew
back
instinctively
i
wont
he
said
but
she
would
not
let
him
go
she
sought
his
mouth
with
her
lips
he
took
her
hands
and
tore
them
roughly
apart
and
pushed
her
away
you
disgust
me
he
said
me
she
steadied
herself
with
one
hand
on
the
chimneypiece
she
looked
at
him
for
an
instant
and
two
red
spots
suddenly
appeared
on
her
cheeks
she
gave
a
shrill
angry
laugh
i
disgust
you
she
paused
and
drew
in
her
breath
sharply
then
she
burst
into
a
furious
torrent
of
abuse
she
shouted
at
the
top
of
her
voice
she
called
him
every
foul
name
she
could
think
of
she
used
language
so
obscene
that
philip
was
astounded
she
was
always
so
anxious
to
be
refined
so
shocked
by
coarseness
that
it
had
never
occurred
to
him
that
she
knew
the
words
she
used
now
she
came
up
to
him
and
thrust
her
face
in
his
it
was
distorted
with
passion
and
in
her
tumultuous
speech
the
spittle
dribbled
over
her
lips
i
never
cared
for
you
not
once
i
was
making
a
fool
of
you
always
you
bored
me
you
bored
me
stiff
and
i
hated
you
i
would
never
have
let
you
touch
me
only
for
the
money
and
it
used
to
make
me
sick
when
i
had
to
let
you
kiss
me
we
laughed
at
you
griffiths
and
me
we
laughed
because
you
was
such
a
mug
a
mug
a
mug
then
she
burst
again
into
abominable
invective
she
accused
him
of
every
mean
fault
she
said
he
was
stingy
she
said
he
was
dull
she
said
he
was
vain
selfish
she
cast
virulent
ridicule
on
everything
upon
which
he
was
most
sensitive
aud
at
last
she
turned
to
go
she
kept
on
with
hysterical
violence
shouting
at
him
an
opprobrious
filthy
epithet
she
seized
the
handle
of
the
door
and
flung
it
open
then
she
turned
round
and
hurled
at
him
the
injury
which
she
knew
was
the
only
one
that
really
touched
him
she
threw
into
the
word
all
the
malice
and
all
the
venom
of
which
she
was
capable
she
flung
it
at
him
as
though
it
were
a
blow
cripple
chapter
xcvii
philip
awoke
with
a
start
next
morning
conscious
that
it
was
late
and
looking
at
his
watch
found
it
was
nine
oclock
he
jumped
out
of
bed
and
went
into
the
kitchen
to
get
himself
some
hot
water
to
shave
with
there
was
no
sign
of
mildred
and
the
things
which
she
had
used
for
her
supper
the
night
before
still
lay
in
the
sink
unwashed
he
knocked
at
her
door
wake
up
mildred
its
awfully
late
she
did
not
answer
even
after
a
second
louder
knocking
and
he
concluded
that
she
was
sulking
he
was
in
too
great
a
hurry
to
bother
about
that
he
put
some
water
on
to
boil
and
jumped
into
his
bath
which
was
always
poured
out
the
night
before
in
order
to
take
the
chill
off
he
presumed
that
mildred
would
cook
his
breakfast
while
he
was
dressing
and
leave
it
in
the
sittingroom
she
had
done
that
two
or
three
times
when
she
was
out
of
temper
but
he
heard
no
sound
of
her
moving
and
realised
that
if
he
wanted
anything
to
eat
he
would
have
to
get
it
himself
he
was
irritated
that
she
should
play
him
such
a
trick
on
a
morning
when
he
had
overslept
himself
there
was
still
no
sign
of
her
when
he
was
ready
but
he
heard
her
moving
about
her
room
she
was
evidently
getting
up
he
made
himself
some
tea
and
cut
himself
a
couple
of
pieces
of
bread
and
butter
which
he
ate
while
he
was
putting
on
his
boots
then
bolted
downstairs
and
along
the
street
into
the
main
road
to
catch
his
tram
while
his
eyes
sought
out
the
newspaper
shops
to
see
the
war
news
on
the
placards
he
thought
of
the
scene
of
the
night
before
now
that
it
was
over
and
he
had
slept
on
it
he
could
not
help
thinking
it
grotesque
he
supposed
he
had
been
ridiculous
but
he
was
not
master
of
his
feelings
at
the
time
they
had
been
overwhelming
he
was
angry
with
mildred
because
she
had
forced
him
into
that
absurd
position
and
then
with
renewed
astonishment
he
thought
of
her
outburst
and
the
filthy
language
she
had
used
he
could
not
help
flushing
when
he
remembered
her
final
jibe
but
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
contemptuously
he
had
long
known
that
when
his
fellows
were
angry
with
him
they
never
failed
to
taunt
him
with
his
deformity
he
had
seen
men
at
the
hospital
imitate
his
walk
not
before
him
as
they
used
at
school
but
when
they
thought
he
was
not
looking
he
knew
now
that
they
did
it
from
no
wilful
unkindness
but
because
man
is
naturally
an
imitative
animal
and
because
it
was
an
easy
way
to
make
people
laugh
he
knew
it
but
he
could
never
resign
himself
to
it
he
was
glad
to
throw
himself
into
his
work
the
ward
seemed
pleasant
and
friendly
when
he
entered
it
the
sister
greeted
him
with
a
quick
businesslike
smile
youre
very
late
mr
carey
i
was
out
on
the
loose
last
night
you
look
it
thank
you
laughing
he
went
to
the
first
of
his
cases
a
boy
with
tuberculous
ulcers
and
removed
his
bandages
the
boy
was
pleased
to
see
him
and
philip
chaffed
him
as
he
put
a
clean
dressing
on
the
wound
philip
was
a
favourite
with
the
patients
he
treated
them
goodhumouredly
and
he
had
gentle
sensitive
hands
which
did
not
hurt
them
some
of
the
dressers
were
a
little
rough
and
happygolucky
in
their
methods
he
lunched
with
his
friends
in
the
clubroom
a
frugal
meal
consisting
of
a
scone
and
butter
with
a
cup
of
cocoa
and
they
talked
of
the
war
several
men
were
going
out
but
the
authorities
were
particular
and
refused
everyone
who
had
not
had
a
hospital
appointment
someone
suggested
that
if
the
war
went
on
in
a
while
they
would
be
glad
to
take
anyone
who
was
qualified
but
the
general
opinion
was
that
it
would
be
over
in
a
month
now
that
roberts
was
there
things
would
get
all
right
in
no
time
this
was
macalisters
opinion
too
and
he
had
told
philip
that
they
must
watch
their
chance
and
buy
just
before
peace
was
declared
there
would
be
a
boom
then
and
they
might
all
make
a
bit
of
money
philip
had
left
with
macalister
instructions
to
buy
him
stock
whenever
the
opportunity
presented
itself
his
appetite
had
been
whetted
by
the
thirty
pounds
he
had
made
in
the
summer
and
he
wanted
now
to
make
a
couple
of
hundred
he
finished
his
days
work
and
got
on
a
tram
to
go
back
to
kennington
he
wondered
how
mildred
would
behave
that
evening
it
was
a
nuisance
to
think
that
she
would
probably
be
surly
and
refuse
to
answer
his
questions
it
was
a
warm
evening
for
the
time
of
year
and
even
in
those
gray
streets
of
south
london
there
was
the
languor
of
february
nature
is
restless
then
after
the
long
winter
months
growing
things
awake
from
their
sleep
and
there
is
a
rustle
in
the
earth
a
forerunner
of
spring
as
it
resumes
its
eternal
activities
philip
would
have
liked
to
drive
on
further
it
was
distasteful
to
him
to
go
back
to
his
rooms
and
he
wanted
the
air
but
the
desire
to
see
the
child
clutched
suddenly
at
his
heartstrings
and
he
smiled
to
himself
as
he
thought
of
her
toddling
towards
him
with
a
crow
of
delight
he
was
surprised
when
he
reached
the
house
and
looked
up
mechanically
at
the
windows
to
see
that
there
was
no
light
he
went
upstairs
and
knocked
but
got
no
answer
when
mildred
went
out
she
left
the
key
under
the
mat
and
he
found
it
there
now
he
let
himself
in
and
going
into
the
sittingroom
struck
a
match
something
had
happened
he
did
not
at
once
know
what
he
turned
the
gas
on
full
and
lit
it
the
room
was
suddenly
filled
with
the
glare
and
he
looked
round
he
gasped
the
whole
place
was
wrecked
everything
in
it
had
been
wilfully
destroyed
anger
seized
him
and
he
rushed
into
mildreds
room
it
was
dark
and
empty
when
he
had
got
a
light
he
saw
that
she
had
taken
away
all
her
things
and
the
babys
he
had
noticed
on
entering
that
the
gocart
was
not
in
its
usual
place
on
the
landing
but
thought
mildred
had
taken
the
baby
out
and
all
the
things
on
the
washingstand
had
been
broken
a
knife
had
been
drawn
crossways
through
the
seats
of
the
two
chairs
the
pillow
had
been
slit
open
there
were
large
gashes
in
the
sheets
and
the
counterpane
the
lookingglass
appeared
to
have
been
broken
with
a
hammer
philip
was
bewildered
he
went
into
his
own
room
and
here
too
everything
was
in
confusion
the
basin
and
the
ewer
had
been
smashed
the
lookingglass
was
in
fragments
and
the
sheets
were
in
ribands
mildred
had
made
a
slit
large
enough
to
put
her
hand
into
the
pillow
and
had
scattered
the
feathers
about
the
room
she
had
jabbed
a
knife
into
the
blankets
on
the
dressingtable
were
photographs
of
philips
mother
the
frames
had
been
smashed
and
the
glass
shivered
philip
went
into
the
tiny
kitchen
everything
that
was
breakable
was
broken
glasses
puddingbasins
plates
dishes
it
took
philips
breath
away
mildred
had
left
no
letter
nothing
but
this
ruin
to
mark
her
anger
and
he
could
imagine
the
set
face
with
which
she
had
gone
about
her
work
he
went
back
into
the
sittingroom
and
looked
about
him
he
was
so
astonished
that
he
no
longer
felt
angry
he
looked
curiously
at
the
kitchenknife
and
the
coalhammer
which
were
lying
on
the
table
where
she
had
left
them
then
his
eye
caught
a
large
carvingknife
in
the
fireplace
which
had
been
broken
it
must
have
taken
her
a
long
time
to
do
so
much
damage
lawsons
portrait
of
him
had
been
cut
crossways
and
gaped
hideously
his
own
drawings
had
been
ripped
in
pieces
and
the
photographs
manets
olympia
and
the
odalisque
of
ingres
the
portrait
of
philip
iv
had
been
smashed
with
great
blows
of
the
coalhammer
there
were
gashes
in
the
tablecloth
and
in
the
curtains
and
in
the
two
armchairs
they
were
quite
ruined
on
one
wall
over
the
table
which
philip
used
as
his
desk
was
the
little
bit
of
persian
rug
which
cronshaw
had
given
him
mildred
had
always
hated
it
if
its
a
rug
it
ought
to
go
on
the
floor
she
said
and
its
a
dirty
stinking
bit
of
stuff
thats
all
it
is
it
made
her
furious
because
philip
told
her
it
contained
the
answer
to
a
great
riddle
she
thought
he
was
making
fun
of
her
she
had
drawn
the
knife
right
through
it
three
times
it
must
have
required
some
strength
and
it
hung
now
in
tatters
philip
had
two
or
three
blue
and
white
plates
of
no
value
but
he
had
bought
them
one
by
one
for
very
small
sums
and
liked
them
for
their
associations
they
littered
the
floor
in
fragments
there
were
long
gashes
on
the
backs
of
his
books
and
she
had
taken
the
trouble
to
tear
pages
out
of
the
unbound
french
ones
the
little
ornaments
on
the
chimneypiece
lay
on
the
hearth
in
bits
everything
that
it
had
been
possible
to
destroy
with
a
knife
or
a
hammer
was
destroyed
the
whole
of
philips
belongings
would
not
have
sold
for
thirty
pounds
but
most
of
them
were
old
friends
and
he
was
a
domestic
creature
attached
to
all
those
odds
and
ends
because
they
were
his
he
had
been
proud
of
his
little
home
and
on
so
little
money
had
made
it
pretty
and
characteristic
he
sank
down
now
in
despair
he
asked
himself
how
she
could
have
been
so
cruel
a
sudden
fear
got
him
on
his
feet
again
and
into
the
passage
where
stood
a
cupboard
in
which
he
kept
his
clothes
he
opened
it
and
gave
a
sigh
of
relief
she
had
apparently
forgotten
it
and
none
of
his
things
was
touched
he
went
back
into
the
sittingroom
and
surveying
the
scene
wondered
what
to
do
he
had
not
the
heart
to
begin
trying
to
set
things
straight
besides
there
was
no
food
in
the
house
and
he
was
hungry
he
went
out
and
got
himself
something
to
eat
when
he
came
in
he
was
cooler
a
little
pang
seized
him
as
he
thought
of
the
child
and
he
wondered
whether
she
would
miss
him
at
first
perhaps
but
in
a
week
she
would
have
forgotten
him
and
he
was
thankful
to
be
rid
of
mildred
he
did
not
think
of
her
with
wrath
but
with
an
overwhelming
sense
of
boredom
i
hope
to
god
i
never
see
her
again
he
said
aloud
the
only
thing
now
was
to
leave
the
rooms
and
he
made
up
his
mind
to
give
notice
the
next
morning
he
could
not
afford
to
make
good
the
damage
done
and
he
had
so
little
money
left
that
he
must
find
cheaper
lodgings
still
he
would
be
glad
to
get
out
of
them
the
expense
had
worried
him
and
now
the
recollection
of
mildred
would
be
in
them
always
philip
was
impatient
and
could
never
rest
till
he
had
put
in
action
the
plan
which
he
had
in
mind
so
on
the
following
afternoon
he
got
in
a
dealer
in
secondhand
furniture
who
offered
him
three
pounds
for
all
his
goods
damaged
and
undamaged
and
two
days
later
he
moved
into
the
house
opposite
the
hospital
in
which
he
had
had
rooms
when
first
he
became
a
medical
student
the
landlady
was
a
very
decent
woman
he
took
a
bedroom
at
the
top
which
she
let
him
have
for
six
shillings
a
week
it
was
small
and
shabby
and
looked
on
the
yard
of
the
house
that
backed
on
to
it
but
he
had
nothing
now
except
his
clothes
and
a
box
of
books
and
he
was
glad
to
lodge
so
cheaply
chapter
xcviii
and
now
it
happened
that
the
fortunes
of
philip
carey
of
no
consequence
to
any
but
himself
were
affected
by
the
events
through
which
his
country
was
passing
history
was
being
made
and
the
process
was
so
significant
that
it
seemed
absurd
it
should
touch
the
life
of
an
obscure
medical
student
battle
after
battle
magersfontein
colenso
spion
kop
lost
on
the
playing
fields
of
eton
had
humiliated
the
nation
and
dealt
the
deathblow
to
the
prestige
of
the
aristocracy
and
gentry
who
till
then
had
found
no
one
seriously
to
oppose
their
assertion
that
they
possessed
a
natural
instinct
of
government
the
old
order
was
being
swept
away
history
was
being
made
indeed
then
the
colossus
put
forth
his
strength
and
blundering
again
at
last
blundered
into
the
semblance
of
victory
cronje
surrendered
at
paardeberg
ladysmith
was
relieved
and
at
the
beginning
of
march
lord
roberts
marched
into
bloemfontein
it
was
two
or
three
days
after
the
news
of
this
reached
london
that
macalister
came
into
the
tavern
in
beak
street
and
announced
joyfully
that
things
were
looking
brighter
on
the
stock
exchange
peace
was
in
sight
roberts
would
march
into
pretoria
within
a
few
weeks
and
shares
were
going
up
already
there
was
bound
to
be
a
boom
nows
the
time
to
come
in
he
told
philip
its
no
good
waiting
till
the
public
gets
on
to
it
its
now
or
never
he
had
inside
information
the
manager
of
a
mine
in
south
africa
had
cabled
to
the
senior
partner
of
his
firm
that
the
plant
was
uninjured
they
would
start
working
again
as
soon
as
possible
it
wasnt
a
speculation
it
was
an
investment
to
show
how
good
a
thing
the
senior
partner
thought
it
macalister
told
philip
that
he
had
bought
five
hundred
shares
for
both
his
sisters
he
never
put
them
into
anything
that
wasnt
as
safe
as
the
bank
of
england
im
going
to
put
my
shirt
on
it
myself
he
said
the
shares
were
two
and
an
eighth
to
a
quarter
he
advised
philip
not
to
be
greedy
but
to
be
satisfied
with
a
tenshilling
rise
he
was
buying
three
hundred
for
himself
and
suggested
that
philip
should
do
the
same
he
would
hold
them
and
sell
when
he
thought
fit
philip
had
great
faith
in
him
partly
because
he
was
a
scotsman
and
therefore
by
nature
cautious
and
partly
because
he
had
been
right
before
he
jumped
at
the
suggestion
i
daresay
we
shall
be
able
to
sell
before
the
account
said
macalister
but
if
not
ill
arrange
to
carry
them
over
for
you
it
seemed
a
capital
system
to
philip
you
held
on
till
you
got
your
profit
and
you
never
even
had
to
put
your
hand
in
your
pocket
he
began
to
watch
the
stock
exchange
columns
of
the
paper
with
new
interest
next
day
everything
was
up
a
little
and
macalister
wrote
to
say
that
he
had
had
to
pay
two
and
a
quarter
for
the
shares
he
said
that
the
market
was
firm
but
in
a
day
or
two
there
was
a
setback
the
news
that
came
from
south
africa
was
less
reassuring
and
philip
with
anxiety
saw
that
his
shares
had
fallen
to
two
but
macalister
was
optimistic
the
boers
couldnt
hold
out
much
longer
and
he
was
willing
to
bet
a
tophat
that
roberts
would
march
into
johannesburg
before
the
middle
of
april
at
the
account
philip
had
to
pay
out
nearly
forty
pounds
it
worried
him
considerably
but
he
felt
that
the
only
course
was
to
hold
on
in
his
circumstances
the
loss
was
too
great
for
him
to
pocket
for
two
or
three
weeks
nothing
happened
the
boers
would
not
understand
that
they
were
beaten
and
nothing
remained
for
them
but
to
surrender
in
fact
they
had
one
or
two
small
successes
and
philips
shares
fell
half
a
crown
more
it
became
evident
that
the
war
was
not
finished
there
was
a
lot
of
selling
when
macalister
saw
philip
he
was
pessimistic
im
not
sure
if
the
best
thing
wouldnt
be
to
cut
the
loss
ive
been
paying
out
about
as
much
as
i
want
to
in
differences
philip
was
sick
with
anxiety
he
could
not
sleep
at
night
he
bolted
his
breakfast
reduced
now
to
tea
and
bread
and
butter
in
order
to
get
over
to
the
club
readingroom
and
see
the
paper
sometimes
the
news
was
bad
and
sometimes
there
was
no
news
at
all
but
when
the
shares
moved
it
was
to
go
down
he
did
not
know
what
to
do
if
he
sold
now
he
would
lose
altogether
hard
on
three
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
and
that
would
leave
him
only
eighty
pounds
to
go
on
with
he
wished
with
all
his
heart
that
he
had
never
been
such
a
fool
as
to
dabble
on
the
stock
exchange
but
the
only
thing
was
to
hold
on
something
decisive
might
happen
any
day
and
the
shares
would
go
up
he
did
not
hope
now
for
a
profit
but
he
wanted
to
make
good
his
loss
it
was
his
only
chance
of
finishing
his
course
at
the
hospital
the
summer
session
was
beginning
in
may
and
at
the
end
of
it
he
meant
to
take
the
examination
in
midwifery
then
he
would
only
have
a
year
more
he
reckoned
it
out
carefully
and
came
to
the
conclusion
that
he
could
manage
it
fees
and
all
on
a
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
but
that
was
the
least
it
could
possibly
be
done
on
early
in
april
he
went
to
the
tavern
in
beak
street
anxious
to
see
macalister
it
eased
him
a
little
to
discuss
the
situation
with
him
and
to
realise
that
numerous
people
beside
himself
were
suffering
from
loss
of
money
made
his
own
trouble
a
little
less
intolerable
but
when
philip
arrived
no
one
was
there
but
hayward
and
no
sooner
had
philip
seated
himself
than
he
said
im
sailing
for
the
cape
on
sunday
are
you
exclaimed
philip
hayward
was
the
last
person
he
would
have
expected
to
do
anything
of
the
kind
at
the
hospital
men
were
going
out
now
in
numbers
the
government
was
glad
to
get
anyone
who
was
qualified
and
others
going
out
as
troopers
wrote
home
that
they
had
been
put
on
hospital
work
as
soon
as
it
was
learned
that
they
were
medical
students
a
wave
of
patriotic
feeling
had
swept
over
the
country
and
volunteers
were
coming
from
all
ranks
of
society
what
are
you
going
as
asked
philip
oh
in
the
dorset
yeomanry
im
going
as
a
trooper
philip
had
known
hayward
for
eight
years
the
youthful
intimacy
which
had
come
from
philips
enthusiastic
admiration
for
the
man
who
could
tell
him
of
art
and
literature
had
long
since
vanished
but
habit
had
taken
its
place
and
when
hayward
was
in
london
they
saw
one
another
once
or
twice
a
week
he
still
talked
about
books
with
a
delicate
appreciation
philip
was
not
yet
tolerant
and
sometimes
haywards
conversation
irritated
him
he
no
longer
believed
implicitly
that
nothing
in
the
world
was
of
consequence
but
art
he
resented
haywards
contempt
for
action
and
success
philip
stirring
his
punch
thought
of
his
early
friendship
and
his
ardent
expectation
that
hayward
would
do
great
things
it
was
long
since
he
had
lost
all
such
illusions
and
he
knew
now
that
hayward
would
never
do
anything
but
talk
he
found
his
three
hundred
a
year
more
difficult
to
live
on
now
that
he
was
thirtyfive
than
he
had
when
he
was
a
young
man
and
his
clothes
though
still
made
by
a
good
tailor
were
worn
a
good
deal
longer
than
at
one
time
he
would
have
thought
possible
he
was
too
stout
and
no
artful
arrangement
of
his
fair
hair
could
conceal
the
fact
that
he
was
bald
his
blue
eyes
were
dull
and
pale
it
was
not
hard
to
guess
that
he
drank
too
much
what
on
earth
made
you
think
of
going
out
to
the
cape
asked
philip
oh
i
dont
know
i
thought
i
ought
to
philip
was
silent
he
felt
rather
silly
he
understood
that
hayward
was
being
driven
by
an
uneasiness
in
his
soul
which
he
could
not
account
for
some
power
within
him
made
it
seem
necessary
to
go
and
fight
for
his
country
it
was
strange
since
he
considered
patriotism
no
more
than
a
prejudice
and
flattering
himself
on
his
cosmopolitanism
he
had
looked
upon
england
as
a
place
of
exile
his
countrymen
in
the
mass
wounded
his
susceptibilities
philip
wondered
what
it
was
that
made
people
do
things
which
were
so
contrary
to
all
their
theories
of
life
it
would
have
been
reasonable
for
hayward
to
stand
aside
and
watch
with
a
smile
while
the
barbarians
slaughtered
one
another
it
looked
as
though
men
were
puppets
in
the
hands
of
an
unknown
force
which
drove
them
to
do
this
and
that
and
sometimes
they
used
their
reason
to
justify
their
actions
and
when
this
was
impossible
they
did
the
actions
in
despite
of
reason
people
are
very
extraordinary
said
philip
i
should
never
have
expected
you
to
go
out
as
a
trooper
hayward
smiled
slightly
embarrassed
and
said
nothing
i
was
examined
yesterday
he
remarked
at
last
it
was
worth
while
undergoing
the
gene
of
it
to
know
that
one
was
perfectly
fit
philip
noticed
that
he
still
used
a
french
word
in
an
affected
way
when
an
english
one
would
have
served
but
just
then
macalister
came
in
i
wanted
to
see
you
carey
he
said
my
people
dont
feel
inclined
to
hold
those
shares
any
more
the
markets
in
such
an
awful
state
and
they
want
you
to
take
them
up
philips
heart
sank
he
knew
that
was
impossible
it
meant
that
he
must
accept
the
loss
his
pride
made
him
answer
calmly
i
dont
know
that
i
think
thats
worth
while
youd
better
sell
them
its
all
very
fine
to
say
that
im
not
sure
if
i
can
the
markets
stagnant
there
are
no
buyers
but
theyre
marked
down
at
one
and
an
eighth
oh
yes
but
that
doesnt
mean
anything
you
cant
get
that
for
them
philip
did
not
say
anything
for
a
moment
he
was
trying
to
collect
himself
dyou
mean
to
say
theyre
worth
nothing
at
all
oh
i
dont
say
that
of
course
theyre
worth
something
but
you
see
nobodys
buying
them
now
then
you
must
just
sell
them
for
what
you
can
get
macalister
looked
at
philip
narrowly
he
wondered
whether
he
was
very
hard
hit
im
awfully
sorry
old
man
but
were
all
in
the
same
boat
no
one
thought
the
war
was
going
to
hang
on
this
way
i
put
you
into
them
but
i
was
in
myself
too
it
doesnt
matter
at
all
said
philip
one
has
to
take
ones
chance
he
moved
back
to
the
table
from
which
he
had
got
up
to
talk
to
macalister
he
was
dumfounded
his
head
suddenly
began
to
ache
furiously
but
he
did
not
want
them
to
think
him
unmanly
he
sat
on
for
an
hour
he
laughed
feverishly
at
everything
they
said
at
last
he
got
up
to
go
you
take
it
pretty
coolly
said
macalister
shaking
hands
with
him
i
dont
suppose
anyone
likes
losing
between
three
and
four
hundred
pounds
when
philip
got
back
to
his
shabby
little
room
he
flung
himself
on
his
bed
and
gave
himself
over
to
his
despair
he
kept
on
regretting
his
folly
bitterly
and
though
he
told
himself
that
it
was
absurd
to
regret
for
what
had
happened
was
inevitable
just
because
it
had
happened
he
could
not
help
himself
he
was
utterly
miserable
he
could
not
sleep
he
remembered
all
the
ways
he
had
wasted
money
during
the
last
few
years
his
head
ached
dreadfully
the
following
evening
there
came
by
the
last
post
the
statement
of
his
account
he
examined
his
passbook
he
found
that
when
he
had
paid
everything
he
would
have
seven
pounds
left
seven
pounds
he
was
thankful
he
had
been
able
to
pay
it
would
have
been
horrible
to
be
obliged
to
confess
to
macalister
that
he
had
not
the
money
he
was
dressing
in
the
eyedepartment
during
the
summer
session
and
he
had
bought
an
ophthalmoscope
off
a
student
who
had
one
to
sell
he
had
not
paid
for
this
but
he
lacked
the
courage
to
tell
the
student
that
he
wanted
to
go
back
on
his
bargain
also
he
had
to
buy
certain
books
he
had
about
five
pounds
to
go
on
with
it
lasted
him
six
weeks
then
he
wrote
to
his
uncle
a
letter
which
he
thought
very
businesslike
he
said
that
owing
to
the
war
he
had
had
grave
losses
and
could
not
go
on
with
his
studies
unless
his
uncle
came
to
his
help
he
suggested
that
the
vicar
should
lend
him
a
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
paid
over
the
next
eighteen
months
in
monthly
instalments
he
would
pay
interest
on
this
and
promised
to
refund
the
capital
by
degrees
when
he
began
to
earn
money
he
would
be
qualified
in
a
year
and
a
half
at
the
latest
and
he
could
be
pretty
sure
then
of
getting
an
assistantship
at
three
pounds
a
week
his
uncle
wrote
back
that
he
could
do
nothing
it
was
not
fair
to
ask
him
to
sell
out
when
everything
was
at
its
worst
and
the
little
he
had
he
felt
that
his
duty
to
himself
made
it
necessary
for
him
to
keep
in
case
of
illness
he
ended
the
letter
with
a
little
homily
he
had
warned
philip
time
after
time
and
philip
had
never
paid
any
attention
to
him
he
could
not
honestly
say
he
was
surprised
he
had
long
expected
that
this
would
be
the
end
of
philips
extravagance
and
want
of
balance
philip
grew
hot
and
cold
when
he
read
this
it
had
never
occurred
to
him
that
his
uncle
would
refuse
and
he
burst
into
furious
anger
but
this
was
succeeded
by
utter
blankness
if
his
uncle
would
not
help
him
he
could
not
go
on
at
the
hospital
panic
seized
him
and
putting
aside
his
pride
he
wrote
again
to
the
vicar
of
blackstable
placing
the
case
before
him
more
urgently
but
perhaps
he
did
not
explain
himself
properly
and
his
uncle
did
not
realise
in
what
desperate
straits
he
was
for
he
answered
that
he
could
not
change
his
mind
philip
was
twentyfive
and
really
ought
to
be
earning
his
living
when
he
died
philip
would
come
into
a
little
but
till
then
he
refused
to
give
him
a
penny
philip
felt
in
the
letter
the
satisfaction
of
a
man
who
for
many
years
had
disapproved
of
his
courses
and
now
saw
himself
justified
chapter
xcix
philip
began
to
pawn
his
clothes
he
reduced
his
expenses
by
eating
only
one
meal
a
day
beside
his
breakfast
and
he
ate
it
bread
and
butter
and
cocoa
at
four
so
that
it
should
last
him
till
next
morning
he
was
so
hungry
by
nine
oclock
that
he
had
to
go
to
bed
he
thought
of
borrowing
money
from
lawson
but
the
fear
of
a
refusal
held
him
back
at
last
he
asked
him
for
five
pounds
lawson
lent
it
with
pleasure
but
as
he
did
so
said
youll
let
me
have
it
back
in
a
week
or
so
wont
you
ive
got
to
pay
my
framer
and
im
awfully
broke
just
now
philip
knew
he
would
not
be
able
to
return
it
and
the
thought
of
what
lawson
would
think
made
him
so
ashamed
that
in
a
couple
of
days
he
took
the
money
back
untouched
lawson
was
just
going
out
to
luncheon
and
asked
philip
to
come
too
philip
could
hardly
eat
he
was
so
glad
to
get
some
solid
food
on
sunday
he
was
sure
of
a
good
dinner
from
athelny
he
hesitated
to
tell
the
athelnys
what
had
happened
to
him
they
had
always
looked
upon
him
as
comparatively
welltodo
and
he
had
a
dread
that
they
would
think
less
well
of
him
if
they
knew
he
was
penniless
though
he
had
always
been
poor
the
possibility
of
not
having
enough
to
eat
had
never
occurred
to
him
it
was
not
the
sort
of
thing
that
happened
to
the
people
among
whom
he
lived
and
he
was
as
ashamed
as
if
he
had
some
disgraceful
disease
the
situation
in
which
he
found
himself
was
quite
outside
the
range
of
his
experience
he
was
so
taken
aback
that
he
did
not
know
what
else
to
do
than
to
go
on
at
the
hospital
he
had
a
vague
hope
that
something
would
turn
up
he
could
not
quite
believe
that
what
was
happening
to
him
was
true
and
he
remembered
how
during
his
first
term
at
school
he
had
often
thought
his
life
was
a
dream
from
which
he
would
awake
to
find
himself
once
more
at
home
but
very
soon
he
foresaw
that
in
a
week
or
so
he
would
have
no
money
at
all
he
must
set
about
trying
to
earn
something
at
once
if
he
had
been
qualified
even
with
a
clubfoot
he
could
have
gone
out
to
the
cape
since
the
demand
for
medical
men
was
now
great
except
for
his
deformity
he
might
have
enlisted
in
one
of
the
yeomanry
regiments
which
were
constantly
being
sent
out
he
went
to
the
secretary
of
the
medical
school
and
asked
if
he
could
give
him
the
coaching
of
some
backward
student
but
the
secretary
held
out
no
hope
of
getting
him
anything
of
the
sort
philip
read
the
advertisement
columns
of
the
medical
papers
and
he
applied
for
the
post
of
unqualified
assistant
to
a
man
who
had
a
dispensary
in
the
fulham
road
when
he
went
to
see
him
he
saw
the
doctor
glance
at
his
clubfoot
and
on
hearing
that
philip
was
only
in
his
fourth
year
at
the
hospital
he
said
at
once
that
his
experience
was
insufficient
philip
understood
that
this
was
only
an
excuse
the
man
would
not
have
an
assistant
who
might
not
be
as
active
as
he
wanted
philip
turned
his
attention
to
other
means
of
earning
money
he
knew
french
and
german
and
thought
there
might
be
some
chance
of
finding
a
job
as
correspondence
clerk
it
made
his
heart
sink
but
he
set
his
teeth
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
though
too
shy
to
answer
the
advertisements
which
demanded
a
personal
application
he
replied
to
those
which
asked
for
letters
but
he
had
no
experience
to
state
and
no
recommendations
he
was
conscious
that
neither
his
german
nor
his
french
was
commercial
he
was
ignorant
of
the
terms
used
in
business
he
knew
neither
shorthand
nor
typewriting
he
could
not
help
recognising
that
his
case
was
hopeless
he
thought
of
writing
to
the
solicitor
who
had
been
his
fathers
executor
but
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
for
it
was
contrary
to
his
express
advice
that
he
had
sold
the
mortgages
in
which
his
money
had
been
invested
he
knew
from
his
uncle
that
mr
nixon
thoroughly
disapproved
of
him
he
had
gathered
from
philips
year
in
the
accountants
office
that
he
was
idle
and
incompetent
id
sooner
starve
philip
muttered
to
himself
once
or
twice
the
possibility
of
suicide
presented
itself
to
him
it
would
be
easy
to
get
something
from
the
hospital
dispensary
and
it
was
a
comfort
to
think
that
if
the
worst
came
to
the
worst
he
had
at
hand
means
of
making
a
painless
end
of
himself
but
it
was
not
a
course
that
he
considered
seriously
when
mildred
had
left
him
to
go
with
griffiths
his
anguish
had
been
so
great
that
he
wanted
to
die
in
order
to
get
rid
of
the
pain
he
did
not
feel
like
that
now
he
remembered
that
the
casualty
sister
had
told
him
how
people
oftener
did
away
with
themselves
for
want
of
money
than
for
want
of
love
and
he
chuckled
when
he
thought
that
he
was
an
exception
he
wished
only
that
he
could
talk
his
worries
over
with
somebody
but
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
confess
them
he
was
ashamed
he
went
on
looking
for
work
he
left
his
rent
unpaid
for
three
weeks
explaining
to
his
landlady
that
he
would
get
money
at
the
end
of
the
month
she
did
not
say
anything
but
pursed
her
lips
and
looked
grim
when
the
end
of
the
month
came
and
she
asked
if
it
would
be
convenient
for
him
to
pay
something
on
account
it
made
him
feel
very
sick
to
say
that
he
could
not
he
told
her
he
would
write
to
his
uncle
and
was
sure
to
be
able
to
settle
his
bill
on
the
following
saturday
well
i
ope
you
will
mr
carey
because
i
ave
my
rent
to
pay
and
i
cant
afford
to
let
accounts
run
on
she
did
not
speak
with
anger
but
with
determination
that
was
rather
frightening
she
paused
for
a
moment
and
then
said
if
you
dont
pay
next
saturday
i
shall
ave
to
complain
to
the
secretary
of
the
ospital
oh
yes
thatll
be
all
right
she
looked
at
him
for
a
little
and
glanced
round
the
bare
room
when
she
spoke
it
was
without
any
emphasis
as
though
it
were
quite
a
natural
thing
to
say
ive
got
a
nice
ot
joint
downstairs
and
if
you
like
to
come
down
to
the
kitchen
youre
welcome
to
a
bit
of
dinner
philip
felt
himself
redden
to
the
soles
of
his
feet
and
a
sob
caught
at
his
throat
thank
you
very
much
mrs
higgins
but
im
not
at
all
hungry
very
good
sir
when
she
left
the
room
philip
threw
himself
on
his
bed
he
had
to
clench
his
fists
in
order
to
prevent
himself
from
crying
chapter
c
saturday
it
was
the
day
on
which
he
had
promised
to
pay
his
landlady
he
had
been
expecting
something
to
turn
up
all
through
the
week
he
had
found
no
work
he
had
never
been
driven
to
extremities
before
and
he
was
so
dazed
that
he
did
not
know
what
to
do
he
had
at
the
back
of
his
mind
a
feeling
that
the
whole
thing
was
a
preposterous
joke
he
had
no
more
than
a
few
coppers
left
he
had
sold
all
the
clothes
he
could
do
without
he
had
some
books
and
one
or
two
odds
and
ends
upon
which
he
might
have
got
a
shilling
or
two
but
the
landlady
was
keeping
an
eye
on
his
comings
and
goings
he
was
afraid
she
would
stop
him
if
he
took
anything
more
from
his
room
the
only
thing
was
to
tell
her
that
he
could
not
pay
his
bill
he
had
not
the
courage
it
was
the
middle
of
june
the
night
was
fine
and
warm
he
made
up
his
mind
to
stay
out
he
walked
slowly
along
the
chelsea
embankment
because
the
river
was
restful
and
quiet
till
he
was
tired
and
then
sat
on
a
bench
and
dozed
he
did
not
know
how
long
he
slept
he
awoke
with
a
start
dreaming
that
he
was
being
shaken
by
a
policeman
and
told
to
move
on
but
when
he
opened
his
eyes
he
found
himself
alone
he
walked
on
he
did
not
know
why
and
at
last
came
to
chiswick
where
he
slept
again
presently
the
hardness
of
the
bench
roused
him
the
night
seemed
very
long
he
shivered
he
was
seized
with
a
sense
of
his
misery
and
he
did
not
know
what
on
earth
to
do
he
was
ashamed
at
having
slept
on
the
embankment
it
seemed
peculiarly
humiliating
and
he
felt
his
cheeks
flush
in
the
darkness
he
remembered
stories
he
had
heard
of
those
who
did
and
how
among
them
were
officers
clergymen
and
men
who
had
been
to
universities
he
wondered
if
he
would
become
one
of
them
standing
in
a
line
to
get
soup
from
a
charitable
institution
it
would
be
much
better
to
commit
suicide
he
could
not
go
on
like
that
lawson
would
help
him
when
he
knew
what
straits
he
was
in
it
was
absurd
to
let
his
pride
prevent
him
from
asking
for
assistance
he
wondered
why
he
had
come
such
a
cropper
he
had
always
tried
to
do
what
he
thought
best
and
everything
had
gone
wrong
he
had
helped
people
when
he
could
he
did
not
think
he
had
been
more
selfish
than
anyone
else
it
seemed
horribly
unjust
that
he
should
be
reduced
to
such
a
pass
but
it
was
no
good
thinking
about
it
he
walked
on
it
was
now
light
the
river
was
beautiful
in
the
silence
and
there
was
something
mysterious
in
the
early
day
it
was
going
to
be
very
fine
and
the
sky
pale
in
the
dawn
was
cloudless
he
felt
very
tired
and
hunger
was
gnawing
at
his
entrails
but
he
could
not
sit
still
he
was
constantly
afraid
of
being
spoken
to
by
a
policeman
he
dreaded
the
mortification
of
that
he
felt
dirty
and
wished
he
could
have
a
wash
at
last
he
found
himself
at
hampton
court
he
felt
that
if
he
did
not
have
something
to
eat
he
would
cry
he
chose
a
cheap
eatinghouse
and
went
in
there
was
a
smell
of
hot
things
and
it
made
him
feel
slightly
sick
he
meant
to
eat
something
nourishing
enough
to
keep
up
for
the
rest
of
the
day
but
his
stomach
revolted
at
the
sight
of
food
he
had
a
cup
of
tea
and
some
bread
and
butter
he
remembered
then
that
it
was
sunday
and
he
could
go
to
the
athelnys
he
thought
of
the
roast
beef
and
the
yorkshire
pudding
they
would
eat
but
he
was
fearfully
tired
and
could
not
face
the
happy
noisy
family
he
was
feeling
morose
and
wretched
he
wanted
to
be
left
alone
he
made
up
his
mind
that
he
would
go
into
the
gardens
of
the
palace
and
lie
down
his
bones
ached
perhaps
he
would
find
a
pump
so
that
he
could
wash
his
hands
and
face
and
drink
something
he
was
very
thirsty
and
now
that
he
was
no
longer
hungry
he
thought
with
pleasure
of
the
flowers
and
the
lawns
and
the
great
leafy
trees
he
felt
that
there
he
could
think
out
better
what
he
must
do
he
lay
on
the
grass
in
the
shade
and
lit
his
pipe
for
economys
sake
he
had
for
a
long
time
confined
himself
to
two
pipes
a
day
he
was
thankful
now
that
his
pouch
was
full
he
did
not
know
what
people
did
when
they
had
no
money
presently
he
fell
asleep
when
he
awoke
it
was
nearly
midday
and
he
thought
that
soon
he
must
be
setting
out
for
london
so
as
to
be
there
in
the
early
morning
and
answer
any
advertisements
which
seemed
to
promise
he
thought
of
his
uncle
who
had
told
him
that
he
would
leave
him
at
his
death
the
little
he
had
philip
did
not
in
the
least
know
how
much
this
was
it
could
not
be
more
than
a
few
hundred
pounds
he
wondered
whether
he
could
raise
money
on
the
reversion
not
without
the
old
mans
consent
and
that
he
would
never
give
the
only
thing
i
can
do
is
to
hang
on
somehow
till
he
dies
philip
reckoned
his
age
the
vicar
of
blackstable
was
well
over
seventy
he
had
chronic
bronchitis
but
many
old
men
had
that
and
lived
on
indefinitely
meanwhile
something
must
turn
up
philip
could
not
get
away
from
the
feeling
that
his
position
was
altogether
abnormal
people
in
his
particular
station
did
not
starve
it
was
because
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
believe
in
the
reality
of
his
experience
that
he
did
not
give
way
to
utter
despair
he
made
up
his
mind
to
borrow
half
a
sovereign
from
lawson
he
stayed
in
the
garden
all
day
and
smoked
when
he
felt
very
hungry
he
did
not
mean
to
eat
anything
until
he
was
setting
out
again
for
london
it
was
a
long
way
and
he
must
keep
up
his
strength
for
that
he
started
when
the
day
began
to
grow
cooler
and
slept
on
benches
when
he
was
tired
no
one
disturbed
him
he
had
a
wash
and
brush
up
and
a
shave
at
victoria
some
tea
and
bread
and
butter
and
while
he
was
eating
this
read
the
advertisement
columns
of
the
morning
paper
as
he
looked
down
them
his
eye
fell
upon
an
announcement
asking
for
a
salesman
in
the
furnishing
drapery
department
of
some
wellknown
stores
he
had
a
curious
little
sinking
of
the
heart
for
with
his
middleclass
prejudices
it
seemed
dreadful
to
go
into
a
shop
but
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
after
all
what
did
it
matter
and
he
made
up
his
mind
to
have
a
shot
at
it
he
had
a
queer
feeling
that
by
accepting
every
humiliation
by
going
out
to
meet
it
even
he
was
forcing
the
hand
of
fate
when
he
presented
himself
feeling
horribly
shy
in
the
department
at
nine
oclock
he
found
that
many
others
were
there
before
him
they
were
of
all
ages
from
boys
of
sixteen
to
men
of
forty
some
were
talking
to
one
another
in
undertones
but
most
were
silent
and
when
he
took
up
his
place
those
around
him
gave
him
a
look
of
hostility
he
heard
one
man
say
the
only
thing
i
look
forward
to
is
getting
my
refusal
soon
enough
to
give
me
time
to
look
elsewhere
the
man
standing
next
him
glanced
at
philip
and
asked
had
any
experience
no
said
philip
he
paused
a
moment
and
then
made
a
remark
even
the
smaller
houses
wont
see
you
without
appointment
after
lunch
philip
looked
at
the
assistants
some
were
draping
chintzes
and
cretonnes
and
others
his
neighbour
told
him
were
preparing
country
orders
that
had
come
in
by
post
at
about
a
quarter
past
nine
the
buyer
arrived
he
heard
one
of
the
men
who
were
waiting
say
to
another
that
it
was
mr
gibbons
he
was
middleaged
short
and
corpulent
with
a
black
beard
and
dark
greasy
hair
he
had
brisk
movements
and
a
clever
face
he
wore
a
silk
hat
and
a
frock
coat
the
lapel
of
which
was
adorned
with
a
white
geranium
surrounded
by
leaves
he
went
into
his
office
leaving
the
door
open
it
was
very
small
and
contained
only
an
american
rolldesk
in
the
corner
a
bookcase
and
a
cupboard
the
men
standing
outside
watched
him
mechanically
take
the
geranium
out
of
his
coat
and
put
it
in
an
inkpot
filled
with
water
it
was
against
the
rules
to
wear
flowers
in
business
during
the
day
the
department
men
who
wanted
to
keep
in
with
the
governor
admired
the
flower
ive
never
seen
better
they
said
you
didnt
grow
it
yourself
yes
i
did
he
smiled
and
a
gleam
of
pride
filled
his
intelligent
eyes
he
took
off
his
hat
and
changed
his
coat
glanced
at
the
letters
and
then
at
the
men
who
were
waiting
to
see
him
he
made
a
slight
sign
with
one
finger
and
the
first
in
the
queue
stepped
into
the
office
they
filed
past
him
one
by
one
and
answered
his
questions
he
put
them
very
briefly
keeping
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
applicants
face
age
experience
why
did
you
leave
your
job
he
listened
to
the
replies
without
expression
when
it
came
to
philips
turn
he
fancied
that
mr
gibbons
stared
at
him
curiously
philips
clothes
were
neat
and
tolerably
cut
he
looked
a
little
different
from
the
others
experience
im
afraid
i
havent
any
said
philip
no
good
philip
walked
out
of
the
office
the
ordeal
had
been
so
much
less
painful
than
he
expected
that
he
felt
no
particular
disappointment
he
could
hardly
hope
to
succeed
in
getting
a
place
the
first
time
he
tried
he
had
kept
the
newspaper
and
now
looked
at
the
advertisements
again
a
shop
in
holborn
needed
a
salesman
too
and
he
went
there
but
when
he
arrived
he
found
that
someone
had
already
been
engaged
if
he
wanted
to
get
anything
to
eat
that
day
he
must
go
to
lawsons
studio
before
he
went
out
to
luncheon
so
he
made
his
way
along
the
brompton
road
to
yeomans
row
i
say
im
rather
broke
till
the
end
of
the
month
he
said
as
soon
as
he
found
an
opportunity
i
wish
youd
lend
me
half
a
sovereign
will
you
it
was
incredible
the
difficulty
he
found
in
asking
for
money
and
he
remembered
the
casual
way
as
though
almost
they
were
conferring
a
favour
men
at
the
hospital
had
extracted
small
sums
out
of
him
which
they
had
no
intention
of
repaying
like
a
shot
said
lawson
but
when
he
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
he
found
that
he
had
only
eight
shillings
philips
heart
sank
oh
well
lend
me
five
bob
will
you
he
said
lightly
here
you
are
philip
went
to
the
public
baths
in
westminster
and
spent
sixpence
on
a
bath
then
he
got
himself
something
to
eat
he
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
himself
in
the
afternoon
he
would
not
go
back
to
the
hospital
in
case
anyone
should
ask
him
questions
and
besides
he
had
nothing
to
do
there
now
they
would
wonder
in
the
two
or
three
departments
he
had
worked
in
why
he
did
not
come
but
they
must
think
what
they
chose
it
did
not
matter
he
would
not
be
the
first
student
who
had
dropped
out
without
warning
he
went
to
the
free
library
and
looked
at
the
papers
till
they
wearied
him
then
he
took
out
stevensons
new
arabian
nights
but
he
found
he
could
not
read
the
words
meant
nothing
to
him
and
he
continued
to
brood
over
his
helplessness
he
kept
on
thinking
the
same
things
all
the
time
and
the
fixity
of
his
thoughts
made
his
head
ache
at
last
craving
for
fresh
air
he
went
into
the
green
park
and
lay
down
on
the
grass
he
thought
miserably
of
his
deformity
which
made
it
impossible
for
him
to
go
to
the
war
he
went
to
sleep
and
dreamt
that
he
was
suddenly
sound
of
foot
and
out
at
the
cape
in
a
regiment
of
yeomanry
the
pictures
he
had
looked
at
in
the
illustrated
papers
gave
materials
for
his
fancy
and
he
saw
himself
on
the
veldt
in
khaki
sitting
with
other
men
round
a
fire
at
night
when
he
awoke
he
found
that
it
was
still
quite
light
and
presently
he
heard
big
ben
strike
seven
he
had
twelve
hours
to
get
through
with
nothing
to
do
he
dreaded
the
interminable
night
the
sky
was
overcast
and
he
feared
it
would
rain
he
would
have
to
go
to
a
lodginghouse
where
he
could
get
a
bed
he
had
seen
them
advertised
on
lamps
outside
houses
in
lambeth
good
beds
sixpence
he
had
never
been
inside
one
and
dreaded
the
foul
smell
and
the
vermin
he
made
up
his
mind
to
stay
in
the
open
air
if
he
possibly
could
he
remained
in
the
park
till
it
was
closed
and
then
began
to
walk
about
he
was
very
tired
the
thought
came
to
him
that
an
accident
would
be
a
piece
of
luck
so
that
he
could
be
taken
to
a
hospital
and
lie
there
in
a
clean
bed
for
weeks
at
midnight
he
was
so
hungry
that
he
could
not
go
without
food
any
more
so
he
went
to
a
coffee
stall
at
hyde
park
corner
and
ate
a
couple
of
potatoes
and
had
a
cup
of
coffee
then
he
walked
again
he
felt
too
restless
to
sleep
and
he
had
a
horrible
dread
of
being
moved
on
by
the
police
he
noted
that
he
was
beginning
to
look
upon
the
constable
from
quite
a
new
angle
this
was
the
third
night
he
had
spent
out
now
and
then
he
sat
on
the
benches
in
piccadilly
and
towards
morning
he
strolled
down
to
the
embankment
he
listened
to
the
striking
of
big
ben
marking
every
quarter
of
an
hour
and
reckoned
out
how
long
it
left
till
the
city
woke
again
in
the
morning
he
spent
a
few
coppers
on
making
himself
neat
and
clean
bought
a
paper
to
read
the
advertisements
and
set
out
once
more
on
the
search
for
work
he
went
on
in
this
way
for
several
days
he
had
very
little
food
and
began
to
feel
weak
and
ill
so
that
he
had
hardly
enough
energy
to
go
on
looking
for
the
work
which
seemed
so
desperately
hard
to
find
he
was
growing
used
now
to
the
long
waiting
at
the
back
of
a
shop
on
the
chance
that
he
would
be
taken
on
and
the
curt
dismissal
he
walked
to
all
parts
of
london
in
answer
to
the
advertisements
and
he
came
to
know
by
sight
men
who
applied
as
fruitlessly
as
himself
one
or
two
tried
to
make
friends
with
him
but
he
was
too
tired
and
too
wretched
to
accept
their
advances
he
did
not
go
any
more
to
lawson
because
he
owed
him
five
shillings
he
began
to
be
too
dazed
to
think
clearly
and
ceased
very
much
to
care
what
would
happen
to
him
he
cried
a
good
deal
at
first
he
was
very
angry
with
himself
for
this
and
ashamed
but
he
found
it
relieved
him
and
somehow
made
him
feel
less
hungry
in
the
very
early
morning
he
suffered
a
good
deal
from
cold
one
night
he
went
into
his
room
to
change
his
linen
he
slipped
in
about
three
when
he
was
quite
sure
everyone
would
be
asleep
and
out
again
at
five
he
lay
on
the
bed
and
its
softness
was
enchanting
all
his
bones
ached
and
as
he
lay
he
revelled
in
the
pleasure
of
it
it
was
so
delicious
that
he
did
not
want
to
go
to
sleep
he
was
growing
used
to
want
of
food
and
did
not
feel
very
hungry
but
only
weak
constantly
now
at
the
back
of
his
mind
was
the
thought
of
doing
away
with
himself
but
he
used
all
the
strength
he
had
not
to
dwell
on
it
because
he
was
afraid
the
temptation
would
get
hold
of
him
so
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
help
himself
he
kept
on
saying
to
himself
that
it
would
be
absurd
to
commit
suicide
since
something
must
happen
soon
he
could
not
get
over
the
impression
that
his
situation
was
too
preposterous
to
be
taken
quite
seriously
it
was
like
an
illness
which
must
be
endured
but
from
which
he
was
bound
to
recover
every
night
he
swore
that
nothing
would
induce
him
to
put
up
with
such
another
and
determined
next
morning
to
write
to
his
uncle
or
to
mr
nixon
the
solicitor
or
to
lawson
but
when
the
time
came
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
make
the
humiliating
confession
of
his
utter
failure
he
did
not
know
how
lawson
would
take
it
in
their
friendship
lawson
had
been
scatterbrained
and
he
had
prided
himself
on
his
common
sense
he
would
have
to
tell
the
whole
history
of
his
folly
he
had
an
uneasy
feeling
that
lawson
after
helping
him
would
turn
the
cold
shoulder
on
him
his
uncle
and
the
solicitor
would
of
course
do
something
for
him
but
he
dreaded
their
reproaches
he
did
not
want
anyone
to
reproach
him
he
clenched
his
teeth
and
repeated
that
what
had
happened
was
inevitable
just
because
it
had
happened
regret
was
absurd
the
days
were
unending
and
the
five
shillings
lawson
had
lent
him
would
not
last
much
longer
philip
longed
for
sunday
to
come
so
that
he
could
go
to
athelnys
he
did
not
know
what
prevented
him
from
going
there
sooner
except
perhaps
that
he
wanted
so
badly
to
get
through
on
his
own
for
athelny
who
had
been
in
straits
as
desperate
was
the
only
person
who
could
do
anything
for
him
perhaps
after
dinner
he
could
bring
himself
to
tell
athelny
that
he
was
in
difficulties
philip
repeated
to
himself
over
and
over
again
what
he
should
say
to
him
he
was
dreadfully
afraid
that
athelny
would
put
him
off
with
airy
phrases
that
would
be
so
horrible
that
he
wanted
to
delay
as
long
as
possible
the
putting
of
him
to
the
test
philip
had
lost
all
confidence
in
his
fellows
saturday
night
was
cold
and
raw
philip
suffered
horribly
from
midday
on
saturday
till
he
dragged
himself
wearily
to
athelnys
house
he
ate
nothing
he
spent
his
last
twopence
on
sunday
morning
on
a
wash
and
a
brush
up
in
the
lavatory
at
charing
cross
chapter
ci
when
philip
rang
a
head
was
put
out
of
the
window
and
in
a
minute
he
heard
a
noisy
clatter
on
the
stairs
as
the
children
ran
down
to
let
him
in
it
was
a
pale
anxious
thin
face
that
he
bent
down
for
them
to
kiss
he
was
so
moved
by
their
exuberant
affection
that
to
give
himself
time
to
recover
he
made
excuses
to
linger
on
the
stairs
he
was
in
a
hysterical
state
and
almost
anything
was
enough
to
make
him
cry
they
asked
him
why
he
had
not
come
on
the
previous
sunday
and
he
told
them
he
had
been
ill
they
wanted
to
know
what
was
the
matter
with
him
and
philip
to
amuse
them
suggested
a
mysterious
ailment
the
name
of
which
doublebarrelled
and
barbarous
with
its
mixture
of
greek
and
latin
medical
nomenclature
bristled
with
such
made
them
shriek
with
delight
they
dragged
philip
into
the
parlour
and
made
him
repeat
it
for
their
fathers
edification
athelny
got
up
and
shook
hands
with
him
he
stared
at
philip
but
with
his
round
bulging
eyes
he
always
seemed
to
stare
philip
did
not
know
why
on
this
occasion
it
made
him
selfconscious
we
missed
you
last
sunday
he
said
philip
could
never
tell
lies
without
embarrassment
and
he
was
scarlet
when
he
finished
his
explanation
for
not
coming
then
mrs
athelny
entered
and
shook
hands
with
him
i
hope
youre
better
mr
carey
she
said
he
did
not
know
why
she
imagined
that
anything
had
been
the
matter
with
him
for
the
kitchen
door
was
closed
when
he
came
up
with
the
children
and
they
had
not
left
him
dinner
wont
be
ready
for
another
ten
minutes
she
said
in
her
slow
drawl
wont
you
have
an
egg
beaten
up
in
a
glass
of
milk
while
youre
waiting
there
was
a
look
of
concern
on
her
face
which
made
philip
uncomfortable
he
forced
a
laugh
and
answered
that
he
was
not
at
all
hungry
sally
came
in
to
lay
the
table
and
philip
began
to
chaff
her
it
was
the
family
joke
that
she
would
be
as
fat
as
an
aunt
of
mrs
athelny
called
aunt
elizabeth
whom
the
children
had
never
seen
but
regarded
as
the
type
of
obscene
corpulence
i
say
what
has
happened
since
i
saw
you
last
sally
philip
began
nothing
that
i
know
of
i
believe
youve
been
putting
on
weight
im
sure
you
havent
she
retorted
youre
a
perfect
skeleton
philip
reddened
thats
a
tu
quoque
sally
cried
her
father
you
will
be
fined
one
golden
hair
of
your
head
jane
fetch
the
shears
well
he
is
thin
father
remonstrated
sally
hes
just
skin
and
bone
thats
not
the
question
child
he
is
at
perfect
liberty
to
be
thin
but
your
obesity
is
contrary
to
decorum
as
he
spoke
he
put
his
arm
proudly
round
her
waist
and
looked
at
her
with
admiring
eyes
let
me
get
on
with
the
table
father
if
i
am
comfortable
there
are
some
who
dont
seem
to
mind
it
the
hussy
cried
athelny
with
a
dramatic
wave
of
the
hand
she
taunts
me
with
the
notorious
fact
that
joseph
a
son
of
levi
who
sells
jewels
in
holbom
has
made
her
an
offer
of
marriage
have
you
accepted
him
sally
asked
philip
dont
you
know
father
better
than
that
by
this
time
theres
not
a
word
of
truth
in
it
well
if
he
hasnt
made
you
an
offer
of
marriage
cried
athelny
by
saint
george
and
merry
england
i
will
seize
him
by
the
nose
and
demand
of
him
immediately
what
are
his
intentions
sit
down
father
dinners
ready
now
then
you
children
get
along
with
you
and
wash
your
hands
all
of
you
and
dont
shirk
it
because
i
mean
to
look
at
them
before
you
have
a
scrap
of
dinner
so
there
philip
thought
he
was
ravenous
till
he
began
to
eat
but
then
discovered
that
his
stomach
turned
against
food
and
he
could
eat
hardly
at
all
his
brain
was
weary
and
he
did
not
notice
that
athelny
contrary
to
his
habit
spoke
very
little
philip
was
relieved
to
be
sitting
in
a
comfortable
house
but
every
now
and
then
he
could
not
prevent
himself
from
glancing
out
of
the
window
the
day
was
tempestuous
the
fine
weather
had
broken
and
it
was
cold
and
there
was
a
bitter
wind
now
and
again
gusts
of
rain
drove
against
the
window
philip
wondered
what
he
should
do
that
night
the
athelnys
went
to
bed
early
and
he
could
not
stay
where
he
was
after
ten
oclock
his
heart
sank
at
the
thought
of
going
out
into
the
bleak
darkness
it
seemed
more
terrible
now
that
he
was
with
his
friends
than
when
he
was
outside
and
alone
he
kept
on
saying
to
himself
that
there
were
plenty
more
who
would
be
spending
the
night
out
of
doors
he
strove
to
distract
his
mind
by
talking
but
in
the
middle
of
his
words
a
spatter
of
rain
against
the
window
would
make
him
start
its
like
march
weather
said
athelny
not
the
sort
of
day
one
would
like
to
be
crossing
the
channel
presently
they
finished
and
sally
came
in
and
cleared
away
would
you
like
a
twopenny
stinker
said
athelny
handing
him
a
cigar
philip
took
it
and
inhaled
the
smoke
with
delight
it
soothed
him
extraordinarily
when
sally
had
finished
athelny
told
her
to
shut
the
door
after
her
now
we
shant
be
disturbed
he
said
turning
to
philip
ive
arranged
with
betty
not
to
let
the
children
come
in
till
i
call
them
philip
gave
him
a
startled
look
but
before
he
could
take
in
the
meaning
of
his
words
athelny
fixing
his
glasses
on
his
nose
with
the
gesture
habitual
to
him
went
on
i
wrote
to
you
last
sunday
to
ask
if
anything
was
the
matter
with
you
and
as
you
didnt
answer
i
went
to
your
rooms
on
wednesday
philip
turned
his
head
away
and
did
not
answer
his
heart
began
to
beat
violently
athelny
did
not
speak
and
presently
the
silence
seemed
intolerable
to
philip
he
could
not
think
of
a
single
word
to
say
your
landlady
told
me
you
hadnt
been
in
since
saturday
night
and
she
said
you
owed
her
for
the
last
month
where
have
you
been
sleeping
all
this
week
it
made
philip
sick
to
answer
he
stared
out
of
the
window
nowhere
i
tried
to
find
you
why
asked
philip
betty
and
i
have
been
just
as
broke
in
our
day
only
we
had
babies
to
look
after
why
didnt
you
come
here
i
couldnt
philip
was
afraid
he
was
going
to
cry
he
felt
very
weak
he
shut
his
eyes
and
frowned
trying
to
control
himself
he
felt
a
sudden
flash
of
anger
with
athelny
because
he
would
not
leave
him
alone
but
he
was
broken
and
presently
his
eyes
still
closed
slowly
in
order
to
keep
his
voice
steady
he
told
him
the
story
of
his
adventures
during
the
last
few
weeks
as
he
spoke
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
behaved
inanely
and
it
made
it
still
harder
to
tell
he
felt
that
athelny
would
think
him
an
utter
fool
now
youre
coming
to
live
with
us
till
you
find
something
to
do
said
athelny
when
he
had
finished
philip
flushed
he
knew
not
why
oh
its
awfully
kind
of
you
but
i
dont
think
ill
do
that
why
not
philip
did
not
answer
he
had
refused
instinctively
from
fear
that
he
would
be
a
bother
and
he
had
a
natural
bashfulness
of
accepting
favours
he
knew
besides
that
the
athelnys
lived
from
hand
to
mouth
and
with
their
large
family
had
neither
space
nor
money
to
entertain
a
stranger
of
course
you
must
come
here
said
athelny
thorpe
will
tuck
in
with
one
of
his
brothers
and
you
can
sleep
in
his
bed
you
dont
suppose
your
foods
going
to
make
any
difference
to
us
philip
was
afraid
to
speak
and
athelny
going
to
the
door
called
his
wife
betty
he
said
when
she
came
in
mr
careys
coming
to
live
with
us
oh
that
is
nice
she
said
ill
go
and
get
the
bed
ready
she
spoke
in
such
a
hearty
friendly
tone
taking
everything
for
granted
that
philip
was
deeply
touched
he
never
expected
people
to
be
kind
to
him
and
when
they
were
it
surprised
and
moved
him
now
he
could
not
prevent
two
large
tears
from
rolling
down
his
cheeks
the
athelnys
discussed
the
arrangements
and
pretended
not
to
notice
to
what
a
state
his
weakness
had
brought
him
when
mrs
athelny
left
them
philip
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
looking
out
of
the
window
laughed
a
little
its
not
a
very
nice
night
to
be
out
is
it
chapter
cii
athelny
told
philip
that
he
could
easily
get
him
something
to
do
in
the
large
firm
of
linendrapers
in
which
himself
worked
several
of
the
assistants
had
gone
to
the
war
and
lynn
and
sedley
with
patriotic
zeal
had
promised
to
keep
their
places
open
for
them
they
put
the
work
of
the
heroes
on
those
who
remained
and
since
they
did
not
increase
the
wages
of
these
were
able
at
once
to
exhibit
public
spirit
and
effect
an
economy
but
the
war
continued
and
trade
was
less
depressed
the
holidays
were
coming
when
numbers
of
the
staff
went
away
for
a
fortnight
at
a
time
they
were
bound
to
engage
more
assistants
philips
experience
had
made
him
doubtful
whether
even
then
they
would
engage
him
but
athelny
representing
himself
as
a
person
of
consequence
in
the
firm
insisted
that
the
manager
could
refuse
him
nothing
philip
with
his
training
in
paris
would
be
very
useful
it
was
only
a
matter
of
waiting
a
little
and
he
was
bound
to
get
a
wellpaid
job
to
design
costumes
and
draw
posters
philip
made
a
poster
for
the
summer
sale
and
athelny
took
it
away
two
days
later
he
brought
it
back
saying
that
the
manager
admired
it
very
much
and
regretted
with
all
his
heart
that
there
was
no
vacancy
just
then
in
that
department
philip
asked
whether
there
was
nothing
else
he
could
do
im
afraid
not
are
you
quite
sure
well
the
fact
is
theyre
advertising
for
a
shopwalker
tomorrow
said
athelny
looking
at
him
doubtfully
through
his
glasses
dyou
think
i
stand
any
chance
of
getting
it
athelny
was
a
little
confused
he
had
led
philip
to
expect
something
much
more
splendid
on
the
other
hand
he
was
too
poor
to
go
on
providing
him
indefinitely
with
board
and
lodging
you
might
take
it
while
you
wait
for
something
better
you
always
stand
a
better
chance
if
youre
engaged
by
the
firm
already
im
not
proud
you
know
smiled
philip
if
you
decide
on
that
you
must
be
there
at
a
quarter
to
nine
tomorrow
morning
notwithstanding
the
war
there
was
evidently
much
difficulty
in
finding
work
for
when
philip
went
to
the
shop
many
men
were
waiting
already
he
recognised
some
whom
he
had
seen
in
his
own
searching
and
there
was
one
whom
he
had
noticed
lying
about
the
park
in
the
afternoon
to
philip
now
that
suggested
that
he
was
as
homeless
as
himself
and
passed
the
night
out
of
doors
the
men
were
of
all
sorts
old
and
young
tall
and
short
but
every
one
had
tried
to
make
himself
smart
for
the
interview
with
the
manager
they
had
carefully
brushed
hair
and
scrupulously
clean
hands
they
waited
in
a
passage
which
philip
learnt
afterwards
led
up
to
the
dininghall
and
the
work
rooms
it
was
broken
every
few
yards
by
five
or
six
steps
though
there
was
electric
light
in
the
shop
here
was
only
gas
with
wire
cages
over
it
for
protection
and
it
flared
noisily
philip
arrived
punctually
but
it
was
nearly
ten
oclock
when
he
was
admitted
into
the
office
it
was
threecornered
like
a
cut
of
cheese
lying
on
its
side
on
the
walls
were
pictures
of
women
in
corsets
and
two
posterproofs
one
of
a
man
in
pyjamas
green
and
white
in
large
stripes
and
the
other
of
a
ship
in
full
sail
ploughing
an
azure
sea
on
the
sail
was
printed
in
large
letters
great
white
sale
the
widest
side
of
the
office
was
the
back
of
one
of
the
shopwindows
which
was
being
dressed
at
the
time
and
an
assistant
went
to
and
fro
during
the
interview
the
manager
was
reading
a
letter
he
was
a
florid
man
with
sandy
hair
and
a
large
sandy
moustache
from
the
middle
of
his
watchchain
hung
a
bunch
of
football
medals
he
sat
in
his
shirt
sleeves
at
a
large
desk
with
a
telephone
by
his
side
before
him
were
the
days
advertisements
athelnys
work
and
cuttings
from
newspapers
pasted
on
a
card
he
gave
philip
a
glance
but
did
not
speak
to
him
he
dictated
a
letter
to
the
typist
a
girl
who
sat
at
a
small
table
in
one
corner
then
he
asked
philip
his
name
age
and
what
experience
he
had
had
he
spoke
with
a
cockney
twang
in
a
high
metallic
voice
which
he
seemed
not
able
always
to
control
philip
noticed
that
his
upper
teeth
were
large
and
protruding
they
gave
you
the
impression
that
they
were
loose
and
would
come
out
if
you
gave
them
a
sharp
tug
i
think
mr
athelny
has
spoken
to
you
about
me
said
philip
oh
you
are
the
young
feller
who
did
that
poster
yes
sir
no
good
to
us
you
know
not
a
bit
of
good
he
looked
philip
up
and
down
he
seemed
to
notice
that
philip
was
in
some
way
different
from
the
men
who
had
preceded
him
youd
ave
to
get
a
frock
coat
you
know
i
suppose
you
avent
got
one
you
seem
a
respectable
young
feller
i
suppose
you
found
art
didnt
pay
philip
could
not
tell
whether
he
meant
to
engage
him
or
not
he
threw
remarks
at
him
in
a
hostile
way
wheres
your
home
my
father
and
mother
died
when
i
was
a
child
i
like
to
give
young
fellers
a
chance

it

odd
to
him
and
he
was
afraid
of
overdoing
it
the
manager
liked
talking
it
gave
him
a
happy
consciousness
of
his
own
importance

he
did
not
give
philip
his
decision

ciii
mrs
athelny
lent
philip
money
to
pay
his
landlady
enough
of
her
bill
to
let
him
take
his
things
away
for
five
shillings
and
the
pawnticket
on
a
suit
he
was
able
to
get
from
a
pawnbroker
a
frock
coat
which
fitted
him
fairly
well
he
redeemed
the
rest
of
his
clothes
he
sent
his
box
to
harrington
street
by
carter
patterson
and
on
monday
morning
went
with
athelny
to
the
shop
athelny
introduced
him
to
the
buyer
of
the
costumes
and
left
him
the
buyer
was
a
pleasant
fussy
little
man
of
thirty
named
sampson
he
shook
hands
with
philip
and
in
order
to
show
his
own
accomplishment
of
which
he
was
very
proud
asked
him
if
he
spoke
french
he
was
surprised
when
philip
told
him
he
did
any
other
language
i
speak
german
oh
i
go
over
to
paris
myself
occasionally
parlezvous
francais
ever
been
to
maxims
philip
was
stationed
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
in
the
costumes
his
work
consisted
in
directing
people
to
the
various
departments
there
seemed
a
great
many
of
them
as
mr
sampson
tripped
them
off
his
tongue
suddenly
he
noticed
that
philip
limped
whats
the
matter
with
your
leg
he
asked
ive
got
a
clubfoot
said
philip
but
it
doesnt
prevent
my
walking
or
anything
like
that
the
buyer
looked
at
it
for
a
moment
doubtfully
and
philip
surmised
that
he
was
wondering
why
the
manager
had
engaged
him
philip
knew
that
he
had
not
noticed
there
was
anything
the
matter
with
him
i
dont
expect
you
to
get
them
all
correct
the
first
day
if
youre
in
any
doubt
all
youve
got
to
do
is
to
ask
one
of
the
young
ladies
mr
sampson
turned
away
and
philip
trying
to
remember
where
this
or
the
other
department
was
watched
anxiously
for
the
customer
in
search
of
information
at
one
oclock
he
went
up
to
dinner
the
diningroom
on
the
top
floor
of
the
vast
building
was
large
long
and
well
lit
but
all
the
windows
were
shut
to
keep
out
the
dust
and
there
was
a
horrid
smell
of
cooking
there
were
long
tables
covered
with
cloths
with
big
glass
bottles
of
water
at
intervals
and
down
the
centre
salt
cellars
and
bottles
of
vinegar
the
assistants
crowded
in
noisily
and
sat
down
on
forms
still
warm
from
those
who
had
dined
at
twelvethirty
no
pickles
remarked
the
man
next
to
philip
he
was
a
tall
thin
young
man
with
a
hooked
nose
and
a
pasty
face
he
had
a
long
head
unevenly
shaped
as
though
the
skull
had
been
pushed
in
here
and
there
oddly
and
on
his
forehead
and
neck
were
large
acne
spots
red
and
inflamed
his
name
was
harris
philip
discovered
that
on
some
days
there
were
large
soupplates
down
the
table
full
of
mixed
pickles
they
were
very
popular
there
were
no
knives
and
forks
but
in
a
minute
a
large
fat
boy
in
a
white
coat
came
in
with
a
couple
of
handfuls
of
them
and
threw
them
loudly
on
the
middle
of
the
table
each
man
took
what
he
wanted
they
were
warm
and
greasy
from
recent
washing
in
dirty
water
plates
of
meat
swimming
in
gravy
were
handed
round
by
boys
in
white
jackets
and
as
they
flung
each
plate
down
with
the
quick
gesture
of
a
prestidigitator
the
gravy
slopped
over
on
to
the
tablecloth
then
they
brought
large
dishes
of
cabbages
and
potatoes
the
sight
of
them
turned
philips
stomach
he
noticed
that
everyone
poured
quantities
of
vinegar
over
them
the
noise
was
awful
they
talked
and
laughed
and
shouted
and
there
was
the
clatter
of
knives
and
forks
and
strange
sounds
of
eating
philip
was
glad
to
get
back
into
the
department
he
was
beginning
to
remember
where
each
one
was
and
had
less
often
to
ask
one
of
the
assistants
when
somebody
wanted
to
know
the
way
first
to
the
right
second
on
the
left
madam
one
or
two
of
the
girls
spoke
to
him
just
a
word
when
things
were
slack
and
he
felt
they
were
taking
his
measure
at
five
he
was
sent
up
again
to
the
diningroom
for
tea
he
was
glad
to
sit
down
there
were
large
slices
of
bread
heavily
spread
with
butter
and
many
had
pots
of
jam
which
were
kept
in
the
store
and
had
their
names
written
on
philip
was
exhausted
when
work
stopped
at
half
past
six
harris
the
man
he
had
sat
next
to
at
dinner
offered
to
take
him
over
to
harrington
street
to
show
him
where
he
was
to
sleep
he
told
philip
there
was
a
spare
bed
in
his
room
and
as
the
other
rooms
were
full
he
expected
philip
would
be
put
there
the
house
in
harrington
street
had
been
a
bootmakers
and
the
shop
was
used
as
a
bedroom
but
it
was
very
dark
since
the
window
had
been
boarded
three
parts
up
and
as
this
did
not
open
the
only
ventilation
came
from
a
small
skylight
at
the
far
end
there
was
a
musty
smell
and
philip
was
thankful
that
he
would
not
have
to
sleep
there
harris
took
him
up
to
the
sittingroom
which
was
on
the
first
floor
it
had
an
old
piano
in
it
with
a
keyboard
that
looked
like
a
row
of
decayed
teeth
and
on
the
table
in
a
cigarbox
without
a
lid
was
a
set
of
dominoes
old
numbers
of
the
strand
magazine
and
of
the
graphic
were
lying
about
the
other
rooms
were
used
as
bedrooms
that
in
which
philip
was
to
sleep
was
at
the
top
of
the
house
there
were
six
beds
in
it
and
a
trunk
or
a
box
stood
by
the
side
of
each
the
only
furniture
was
a
chest
of
drawers
it
had
four
large
drawers
and
two
small
ones
and
philip
as
the
newcomer
had
one
of
these
there
were
keys
to
them
but
as
they
were
all
alike
they
were
not
of
much
use
and
harris
advised
him
to
keep
his
valuables
in
his
trunk
there
was
a
lookingglass
on
the
chimneypiece
harris
showed
philip
the
lavatory
which
was
a
fairly
large
room
with
eight
basins
in
a
row
and
here
all
the
inmates
did
their
washing
it
led
into
another
room
in
which
were
two
baths
discoloured
the
woodwork
stained
with
soap
and
in
them
were
dark
rings
at
various
intervals
which
indicated
the
water
marks
of
different
baths
when
harris
and
philip
went
back
to
their
bedroom
they
found
a
tall
man
changing
his
clothes
and
a
boy
of
sixteen
whistling
as
loud
as
he
could
while
he
brushed
his
hair
in
a
minute
or
two
without
saying
a
word
to
anybody
the
tall
man
went
out
harris
winked
at
the
boy
and
the
boy
whistling
still
winked
back
harris
told
philip
that
the
man
was
called
prior
he
had
been
in
the
army
and
now
served
in
the
silks
he
kept
pretty
much
to
himself
and
he
went
off
every
night
just
like
that
without
so
much
as
a
goodevening
to
see
his
girl
harris
went
out
too
and
only
the
boy
remained
to
watch
philip
curiously
while
he
unpacked
his
things
his
name
was
bell
and
he
was
serving
his
time
for
nothing
in
the
haberdashery
he
was
much
interested
in
philips
evening
clothes
he
told
him
about
the
other
men
in
the
room
and
asked
him
every
sort
of
question
about
himself
he
was
a
cheerful
youth
and
in
the
intervals
of
conversation
sang
in
a
halfbroken
voice
snatches
of
musichall
songs
when
philip
had
finished
he
went
out
to
walk
about
the
streets
and
look
at
the
crowd
occasionally
he
stopped
outside
the
doors
of
restaurants
and
watched
the
people
going
in
he
felt
hungry
so
he
bought
a
bath
bun
and
ate
it
while
he
strolled
along
he
had
been
given
a
latchkey
by
the
prefect
the
man
who
turned
out
the
gas
at
a
quarter
past
eleven
but
afraid
of
being
locked
out
he
returned
in
good
time
he
had
learned
already
the
system
of
fines
you
had
to
pay
a
shilling
if
you
came
in
after
eleven
and
half
a
crown
after
a
quarter
past
and
you
were
reported
besides
if
it
happened
three
times
you
were
dismissed
all
but
the
soldier
were
in
when
philip
arrived
and
two
were
already
in
bed
philip
was
greeted
with
cries
oh
clarence
naughty
boy
he
discovered
that
bell
had
dressed
up
the
bolster
in
his
evening
clothes
the
boy
was
delighted
with
his
joke
you
must
wear
them
at
the
social
evening
clarence
hell
catch
the
belle
of
lynns
if
hes
not
careful
philip
had
already
heard
of
the
social
evenings
for
the
money
stopped
from
the
wages
to
pay
for
them
was
one
of
the
grievances
of
the
staff
it
was
only
two
shillings
a
month
and
it
covered
medical
attendance
and
the
use
of
a
library
of
worn
novels
but
as
four
shillings
a
month
besides
was
stopped
for
washing
philip
discovered
that
a
quarter
of
his
six
shillings
a
week
would
never
be
paid
to
him
most
of
the
men
were
eating
thick
slices
of
fat
bacon
between
a
roll
of
bread
cut
in
two
these
sandwiches
the
assistants
usual
supper
were
supplied
by
a
small
shop
a
few
doors
off
at
twopence
each
the
soldier
rolled
in
silently
rapidly
took
off
his
clothes
and
threw
himself
into
bed
at
ten
minutes
past
eleven
the
gas
gave
a
big
jump
and
five
minutes
later
went
out
the
soldier
went
to
sleep
but
the
others
crowded
round
the
big
window
in
their
pyjamas
and
nightshirts
and
throwing
remains
of
their
sandwiches
at
the
women
who
passed
in
the
street
below
shouted
to
them
facetious
remarks
the
house
opposite
six
storeys
high
was
a
workshop
for
jewish
tailors
who
left
off
work
at
eleven
the
rooms
were
brightly
lit
and
there
were
no
blinds
to
the
windows
the
sweaters
daughterthe
family
consisted
of
father
mother
two
small
boys
and
a
girl
of
twentywent
round
the
house
to
put
out
the
lights
when
work
was
over
and
sometimes
she
allowed
herself
to
be
made
love
to
by
one
of
the
tailors
the
shop
assistants
in
philips
room
got
a
lot
of
amusement
out
of
watching
the
manoeuvres
of
one
man
or
another
to
stay
behind
and
they
made
small
bets
on
which
would
succeed
at
midnight
the
people
were
turned
out
of
the
harrington
arms
at
the
end
of
the
street
and
soon
after
they
all
went
to
bed
bell
who
slept
nearest
the
door
made
his
way
across
the
room
by
jumping
from
bed
to
bed
and
even
when
he
got
to
his
own
would
not
stop
talking
at
last
everything
was
silent
but
for
the
steady
snoring
of
the
soldier
and
philip
went
to
sleep
he
was
awaked
at
seven
by
the
loud
ringing
of
a
bell
and
by
a
quarter
to
eight
they
were
all
dressed
and
hurrying
downstairs
in
their
stockinged
feet
to
pick
out
their
boots
they
laced
them
as
they
ran
along
to
the
shop
in
oxford
street
for
breakfast
if
they
were
a
minute
later
than
eight
they
got
none
nor
once
in
were
they
allowed
out
to
get
themselves
anything
to
eat
sometimes
if
they
knew
they
could
not
get
into
the
building
in
time
they
stopped
at
the
little
shop
near
their
quarters
and
bought
a
couple
of
buns
but
this
cost
money
and
most
went
without
food
till
dinner
philip
ate
some
bread
and
butter
drank
a
cup
of
tea
and
at
half
past
eight
began
his
days
work
again
first
to
the
right
second
on
the
left
madam
soon
he
began
to
answer
the
questions
quite
mechanically
the
work
was
monotonous
and
very
tiring
after
a
few
days
his
feet
hurt
him
so
that
he
could
hardly
stand
the
thick
soft
carpets
made
them
burn
and
at
night
his
socks
were
painful
to
remove
it
was
a
common
complaint
and
his
fellow
floormen
told
him
that
socks
and
boots
just
rotted
away
from
the
continual
sweating
all
the
men
in
his
room
suffered
in
the
same
fashion
and
they
relieved
the
pain
by
sleeping
with
their
feet
outside
the
bedclothes
at
first
philip
could
not
walk
at
all
and
was
obliged
to
spend
a
good
many
of
his
evenings
in
the
sittingroom
at
harrington
street
with
his
feet
in
a
pail
of
cold
water
his
companion
on
these
occasions
was
bell
the
lad
in
the
haberdashery
who
stayed
in
often
to
arrange
the
stamps
he
collected
as
he
fastened
them
with
little
pieces
of
stamppaper
he
whistled
monotonously
chapter
civ
the
social
evenings
took
place
on
alternate
mondays
there
was
one
at
the
beginning
of
philips
second
week
at

he
arranged
to

of
the

had
a
yellow
face
with
a
network
of
small
red
veins
all
over
it
and
yellow
whites
to
her
pale
blue
eyes
she
took
a
fancy
to
philip
and
called
him
by
his
christian
name
before
he
had
been
in
the
shop
a
week
weve
both
known
what
it
is
to
come
down
she
said
she
told
philip
that
her
real
name
was
not
hodges
but
she
always
referred
to
me
usband
misterodges
he
was
a
barrister
and
he
treated
her
simply
shocking
so
she
left
him
as
she
preferred
to
be
independent

but
she
had
known
what
it
was
to
drive
in
her
own
carriage

enormous
silver
brooch
it
was
in
the
form
of
a
whip
and
a
huntingcrop
crossed
with

philip
was
ill
at
ease
in
his
new
surroundings
and
the
girls
in
the
shop
called
him
sidey
one
addressed
him
as
phil
and
he
did
not
answer
because
he
had
not
the
least
idea
that
she
was
speaking
to
him
so
she
tossed
her
head
saying
he
was
a
stuckup
thing
and
next
time
with
ironical
emphasis
called
him
mister
carey
she
was
a
miss
jewell
and
she
was
going
to
marry
a
doctor
the
other
girls
had

lovely
presents

those
who
were
going
to
take
part
in
the
social
evening
came
in
the
younger
members
of
the
staff
mostly
boys
who
had
not
girls
of
their
own
and
girls
who
had
not
yet
found
anyone
to
walk
with
several
of
the
young
gentlemen
wore
lounge
suits
with
white
evening
ties
and
red
silk
handkerchiefs
they
were
going
to
perform
and
they
had
a
busy
abstracted
air
some
were
selfconfident
but
others
were
nervous
and
they
watched
their
public
with
an
anxious
eye
presently
a
girl
with
a
great
deal
of
hair
sat
at
the
piano
and
ran
her
hands
noisily
across
the
keyboard
when
the
audience
had
settled
itself
she
looked
round
and
gave
the
name
of
her
piece
a
drive
in
russia
there
was
a
round
of
clapping
during
which
she
deftly
fixed
bells
to
her
wrists
she
smiled
a
little
and
immediately
burst
into
energetic
melody
there
was
a
great
deal
more
clapping
when
she
finished
and
when
this
was
over
as
an
encore
she
gave
a
piece
which
imitated
the
sea
there
were
little
trills
to
represent
the
lapping
waves
and
thundering
chords
with
the
loud
pedal
down
to
suggest
a
storm
after
this
a
gentleman
sang
a
song
called
bid
me
goodbye
and
as
an
encore
obliged
with
sing
me
to
sleep
the
audience
measured
their
enthusiasm
with
a
nice
discrimination
everyone
was
applauded
till
he
gave
an
encore
and
so
that
there
might
be
no
jealousy
no
one
was
applauded
more
than
anyone
else
miss
bennett
sailed
up
to
philip
im
sure
you
play
or
sing
mr
carey
she
said
archly
i
can
see
it
in
your
face
im
afraid
i
dont
dont
you
even
recite
i
have
no
parlour
tricks
the
buyer
in
the
gentlemans
hosiery
was
a
wellknown
reciter
and
he
was
called
upon
loudly
to
perform
by
all
the
assistants
in
his
department
needing
no
pressing
he
gave
a
long
poem
of
tragic
character
in
which
he
rolled
his
eyes
put
his
hand
on
his
chest
and
acted
as
though
he
were
in
great
agony
the
point
that
he
had
eaten
cucumber
for
supper
was
divulged
in
the
last
line
and
was
greeted
with
laughter
a
little
forced
because
everyone
knew
the
poem
well
but
loud
and
long
miss
bennett
did
not
sing
play
or
recite
oh
no
she
as
a
little
game
of
her
own
said
mrs
hodges
now
dont
you
begin
chaffing
me
the
fact
is
i
know
quite
a
lot
about
palmistry
and
second
sight
oh

tell
my
and
miss
bennett
cried
the
girls
in
her
department
eager
to
please
her
i
dont
like
telling
ands
i
dont
really
ive
told
people
such
terrible
things
and
theyve
all
come
true
it
makes
one
superstitious
like
oh
miss
bennett
just
for
once
a
little
crowd
collected
round
her
and
amid
screams
of
embarrassment
giggles
blushings
and
cries
of
dismay
or
admiration
she
talked
mysteriously
of
fair
and
dark
men
of
money
in
a
letter
and
of
journeys
till
the
sweat
stood
in
heavy
beads
on
her
painted
face
look
at
me
she
said
im
all
of
a
perspiration
supper
was
at
nine
there
were
cakes
buns
sandwiches
tea
and
coffee
all
free
but
if
you
wanted
mineral
water
you
had
to
pay
for
it
gallantry
often
led
young
men
to
offer
the
ladies
ginger
beer
but
common
decency
made
them
refuse
miss
bennett
was
very
fond
of
ginger
beer
and
she
drank
two
and
sometimes
three
bottles
during
the
evening
but
she
insisted
on
paying
for
them
herself
the
men
liked
her
for
that
shes
a
rum
old
bird
they
said
but
mind
you
shes
not
a
bad
sort
shes
not
like
what
some
are
after
supper
progressive
whist
was
played
this
was
very
noisy
and
there
was
a
great
deal
of
laughing
and
shouting
as
people
moved
from
table
to
table
miss
bennett
grew
hotter
and
hotter
look
at
me
she
said
im
all
of
a
perspiration
in
due
course
one
of
the
more
dashing
of
the
young
men
remarked
that
if
they
wanted
to
dance
theyd
better
begin
the
girl
who
had
played
the
accompaniments
sat
at
the
piano
and
placed
a
decided
foot
on
the
loud
pedal
she
played
a
dreamy
waltz
marking
the
time
with
the
bass
while
with
the
right
hand
she
tiddled
in
alternate
octaves
by
way
of
a
change
she
crossed
her
hands
and
played
the
air
in
the
bass
she
does
play
well
doesnt
she
mrs
hodges
remarked
to
philip
and
whats
more
shes
never
ad
a
lesson
in
er
life
its
all
ear
miss
bennett
liked
dancing
and
poetry
better
than
anything
in
the
world
she
danced
well
but
very
very
slowly
and
an
expression
came
into
her
eyes
as
though
her
thoughts
were
far
far
away
she
talked
breathlessly
of
the
floor
and
the
heat
and
the
supper
she
said
that
the
portman
rooms
had
the
best
floor
in
london
and
she
always
liked
the
dances
there
they
were
very
select
and
she
couldnt
bear
dancing
with
all
sorts
of
men
you
didnt
know
anything
about
why
you
might
be
exposing
yourself
to
you
didnt
know
what
all
nearly
all
the
people
danced
very
well
and
they
enjoyed
themselves
sweat
poured
down
their
faces
and
the
very
high
collars
of
the
young
men
grew
limp
philip
looked
on
and
a
greater
depression
seized
him
than
he
remembered
to
have
felt
for
a
long
time
he
felt
intolerably
alone
he
did
not
go
because
he
was
afraid
to
seem
supercilious
and
he
talked
with
the
girls
and
laughed
but
in
his
heart
was
unhappiness
miss
bennett
asked
him
if
he
had
a
girl
no
he
smiled
oh
well
theres
plenty
to
choose
from
here
and
theyre
very
nice
respectable
girls
some
of
them
i
expect
youll
have
a
girl
before
youve
been
here
long
she
looked
at
him
very
archly
meet
em
alfway
said
mrs
hodges
thats
what
i
tell
him
it
was
nearly
eleven
oclock
and
the
party
broke
up
philip
could
not
get
to
sleep
like
the
others
he
kept
his
aching
feet
outside
the
bedclothes
he
tried
with
all
his
might
not
to
think
of
the
life
he
was
leading
the
soldier
was
snoring
quietly
chapter
cv
the
wages
were
paid
once
a
month
by
the
secretary
on
payday
each
batch
of
assistants
coming
down
from
tea
went
into
the
passage
and
joined
the
long
line
of
people
waiting
orderly
like
the
audience
in
a
queue
outside
a
gallery
door
one
by
one
they
entered
the
office
the
secretary
sat
at
a
desk
with
wooden
bowls
of
money
in
front
of
him
and
he
asked
the
employes
name
he
referred
to
a
book
quickly
after
a
suspicious
glance
at
the
assistant
said
aloud
the
sum
due
and
taking
money
out
of
the
bowl
counted
it
into
his
hand
thank
you
he
said
next
thank
you
was
the
reply
the
assistant
passed
on
to
the
second
secretary
and
before
leaving
the
room
paid
him
four
shillings
for
washing
money
two
shillings
for
the
club
and
any
fines
that
he
might
have
incurred
with
what
he
had
left
he
went
back
into
his
department
and
there
waited
till
it
was
time
to
go
most
of
the
men
in
philips
house
were
in
debt
with
the
woman
who
sold
the
sandwiches
they
generally
ate
for
supper
she
was
a
funny
old
thing
very
fat
with
a
broad
red
face
and
black
hair
plastered
neatly
on
each
side
of
the
forehead
in
the
fashion
shown
in
early
pictures
of
queen
victoria
she
always
wore
a
little
black
bonnet
and
a
white
apron
her
sleeves
were
tucked
up
to
the
elbow
she
cut
the
sandwiches
with
large
dirty
greasy
hands
and
there
was
grease
on
her
bodice
grease
on
her
apron
grease
on
her
skirt
she
was
called
mrs
fletcher
but
everyone
addressed
her
as
ma
she
was
really
fond
of
the
shop
assistants
whom
she
called
her
boys
she
never
minded
giving
credit
towards
the
end
of
the
month
and
it
was
known
that
now
and
then
she
had
lent
someone
or
other
a
few
shillings
when
he
was
in
straits
she
was
a
good
woman
when
they
were
leaving
or
when
they
came
back
from
the
holidays
the
boys
kissed
her
fat
red
cheek
and
more
than
one
dismissed
and
unable
to
find
another
job
had
got
for
nothing
food
to
keep
body
and
soul
together
the
boys
were
sensible
of
her
large
heart
and
repaid
her
with
genuine
affection
there
was
a
story
they
liked
to
tell
of
a
man
who
had
done
well
for
himself
at
bradford
and
had
five
shops
of
his
own
and
had
come
back
after
fifteen
years
and
visited
ma
fletcher
and
given
her
a
gold
watch
philip
found
himself
with
eighteen
shillings
left
out
of
his
months
pay
it
was
the
first
money
he
had
ever
earned
in
his
life
it
gave
him
none
of
the
pride
which
might
have
been
expected
but
merely
a
feeling
of
dismay
the
smallness
of
the
sum
emphasised
the
hopelessness
of
his
position
he
took
fifteen
shillings
to
mrs
athelny
to
pay
back
part
of
what
he
owed
her
but
she
would
not
take
more
than
half
a
sovereign
dyou
know
at
that
rate
itll
take
me
eight
months
to
settle
up
with
you
as
long
as
athelnys
in
work
i
can
afford
to
wait
and
who
knows
praps
theyll
give
you
a
rise
athelny
kept
on
saying
that
he
would
speak
to
the
manager
about
philip
it
was
absurd
that
no
use
should
be
made
of
his
talents
but
he
did
nothing
and
philip
soon
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
pressagent
was
not
a
person
of
so
much
importance
in
the
managers
eyes
as
in
his
own
occasionally
he
saw
athelny
in
the
shop
his
flamboyance
was
extinguished
and
in
neat
commonplace
shabby
clothes
he
hurried
a
subdued
unassuming
little
man
through
the
departments
as
though
anxious
to
escape
notice
when
i
think
of
how
im
wasted
there
he
said
at
home
im
almost
tempted
to
give
in
my
notice
theres
no
scope
for
a
man
like
me
im
stunted
im
starved
mrs
athelny
quietly
sewing
took
no
notice
of
his
complaints
her
mouth
tightened
a
little
its
very
hard
to
get
jobs
in
these
times
its
regular
and
its
safe
i
expect
youll
stay
there
as
long
as
you
give
satisfaction
it
was
evident
that
athelny
would
it
was
interesting
to
see
the
ascendency
which
the
uneducated
woman
bound
to
him
by
no
legal
tie
had
acquired
over
the
brilliant
unstable
man
mrs
athelny
treated
philip
with
motherly
kindness
now
that
he
was
in
a
different
position
and
he
was
touched
by
her
anxiety
that
he
should
make
a
good
meal
it
was
the
solace
of
his
life
and
when
he
grew
used
to
it
the
monotony
of
it
was
what
chiefly
appalled
him
that
he
could
go
every
sunday
to
that
friendly
house
it
was
a
joy
to
sit
in
the
stately
spanish
chairs
and
discuss
all
manner
of
things
with
athelny
though
his
condition
seemed
so
desperate
he
never
left
him
to
go
back
to
harrington
street
without
a
feeling
of
exultation
at
first
philip
in
order
not
to
forget
what
he
had
learned
tried
to
go
on
reading
his
medical
books
but
he
found
it
useless
he
could
not
fix
his
attention
on
them
after
the
exhausting
work
of
the
day
and
it
seemed
hopeless
to
continue
working
when
he
did
not
know
in
how
long
he
would
be
able
to
go
back
to
the
hospital
he
dreamed
constantly
that
he
was
in
the
wards
the
awakening
was
painful
the
sensation
of
other
people
sleeping
in
the
room
was
inexpressibly
irksome
to
him
he
had
been
used
to
solitude
and
to
be
with
others
always
never
to
be
by
himself
for
an
instant
was
at
these
moments
horrible
to
him
it
was
then
that
he
found
it
most
difficult
to
combat
his
despair
he
saw
himself
going
on
with
that
life
first
to
the
right
second
on
the
left
madam
indefinitely
and
having
to
be
thankful
if
he
was
not
sent
away
the
men
who
had
gone
to
the
war
would
be
coming
home
soon
the
firm
had
guaranteed
to
take
them
back
and
this
must
mean
that
others
would
be
sacked
he
would
have
to
stir
himself
even
to
keep
the
wretched
post
he
had
there
was
only
one
thing
to
free
him
and
that
was
the
death
of
his
uncle
he
would
get
a
few
hundred
pounds
then
and
on
this
he
could
finish
his
course
at
the
hospital
philip
began
to
wish
with
all
his
might
for
the
old
mans
death
he
reckoned
out
how
long
he
could
possibly
live
he
was
well
over
seventy
philip
did
not
know
his
exact
age
but
he
must
be
at
least
seventyfive
he
suffered
from
chronic
bronchitis
and
every
winter
had
a
bad
cough
though
he
knew
them
by
heart
philip
read
over
and
over
again
the
details
in
his
textbook
of
medicine
of
chronic
bronchitis
in
the
old
a
severe
winter
might
be
too
much
for
the
old
man
with
all
his
heart
philip
longed
for
cold
and
rain
he
thought
of
it
constantly
so
that
it
became
a
monomania
uncle
william
was
affected
by
the
great
heat
too
and
in
august
they
had
three
weeks
of
sweltering
weather
philip
imagined
to
himself
that
one
day
perhaps
a
telegram
would
come
saying
that
the
vicar
had
died
suddenly
and
he
pictured
to
himself
his
unutterable
relief
as
he
stood
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
and
directed
people
to
the
departments
they
wanted
he
occupied
his
mind
with
thinking
incessantly
what
he
would
do
with
the
money
he
did
not
know
how
much
it
would
be
perhaps
no
more
than
five
hundred
pounds
but
even
that
would
be
enough
he
would
leave
the
shop
at
once
he
would
not
bother
to
give
notice
he
would
pack
his
box
and
go
without
saying
a
word
to
anybody
and
then
he
would
return
to
the
hospital
that
was
the
first
thing
would
he
have
forgotten
much
in
six
months
he
could
get
it
all
back
and
then
he
would
take
his
three
examinations
as
soon
as
he
could
midwifery
first
then
medicine
and
surgery
the
awful
fear
seized
him
that
his
uncle
notwithstanding
his
promises
might
leave
everything
he
had
to
the
parish
or
the
church
the
thought
made
philip
sick
he
could
not
be
so
cruel
but
if
that
happened
philip
was
quite
determined
what
to
do
he
would
not
go
on
in
that
way
indefinitely
his
life
was
only
tolerable
because
he
could
look
forward
to
something
better
if
he
had
no
hope
he
would
have
no
fear
the
only
brave
thing
to
do
then
would
be
to
commit
suicide
and
thinking
this
over
too
philip
decided
minutely
what
painless
drug
he
would
take
and
how
he
would
get
hold
of
it
it
encouraged
him
to
think
that
if
things
became
unendurable
he
had
at
all
events
a
way
out
second
to
the
right
madam
and
down
the
stairs
first
on
the
left
and
straight
through
mr
philips
forward
please
once
a
month
for
a
week
philip
was
on
duty
he
had
to
go
to
the
department
at
seven
in
the
morning
and
keep
an
eye
on
the
sweepers
when
they
finished
he
had
to
take
the
sheets
off
the
cases
and
the
models
then
in
the
evening
when
the
assistants
left
he
had
to
put
back
the
sheets
on
the
models
and
the
cases
and
gang
the
sweepers
again
it
was
a
dusty
dirty
job
he
was
not
allowed
to
read
or
write
or
smoke
but
just
had
to
walk
about
and
the
time
hung
heavily
on
his
hands
when
he
went
off
at
half
past
nine
he
had
supper
given
him
and
this
was
the
only
consolation
for
tea
at
five
oclock
had
left
him
with
a
healthy
appetite
and
the
bread
and
cheese
the
abundant
cocoa
which
the
firm
provided
were
welcome
one
day
when
philip
had
been
at
lynns
for
three
months
mr
sampson
the
buyer
came
into
the
department
fuming
with
anger
the
manager
happening
to
notice
the
costume
window
as
he
came
in
had
sent
for
the
buyer
and
made
satirical
remarks
upon
the
colour
scheme
forced
to
submit
in
silence
to
his
superiors
sarcasm
mr
sampson
took
it
out
of
the
assistants
and
he
rated
the
wretched
fellow
whose
duty
it
was
to
dress
the
window
if
you
want
a
thing
well
done
you
must
do
it
yourself
mr
sampson
stormed
ive
always
said
it
and
i
always
shall
one
cant
leave
anything
to
you
chaps
intelligent
you
call
yourselves
do
you
intelligent
he
threw
the
word
at
the
assistants
as
though
it
were
the
bitterest
term
of
reproach
dont
you
know
that
if
you
put
an
electric
blue
in
the
window
itll
kill
all
the
other
blues
he
looked
round
the
department
ferociously
and
his
eye
fell
upon
philip
youll
dress
the
window
next
friday
carey
lets
see
what
you
can
make
of
it
he
went
into
his
office
muttering
angrily
philips
heart
sank
when
friday
morning
came
he
went
into
the
window
with
a
sickening
sense
of
shame
his
cheeks
were
burning
it
was
horrible
to
display
himself
to
the
passersby
and
though
he
told
himself
it
was
foolish
to
give
way
to
such
a
feeling
he
turned
his
back
to
the
street
there
was
not
much
chance
that
any
of
the
students
at
the
hospital
would
pass
along
oxford
street
at
that
hour
and
he
knew
hardly
anyone
else
in
london
but
as
philip
worked
with
a
huge
lump
in
his
throat
he
fancied
that
on
turning
round
he
would
catch
the
eye
of
some
man
he
knew
he
made
all
the
haste
he
could
by
the
simple
observation
that
all
reds
went
together
and
by
spacing
the
costumes
more
than
was
usual
philip
got
a
very
good
effect
and
when
the
buyer
went
into
the
street
to
look
at
the
result
he
was
obviously
pleased
i
knew
i
shouldnt
go
far
wrong
in
putting
you
on
the
window
the
fact
is
you
and
me
are
gentlemen
mind
you
i
wouldnt
say
this
in
the
department
but
you
and
me
are
gentlemen
and
that
always
tells
its
no
good
your
telling
me
it
doesnt
tell
because
i
know
it
does
tell
philip
was
put
on
the
job
regularly
but
he
could
not
accustom
himself
to
the
publicity
and
he
dreaded
friday
morning
on
which
the
window
was
dressed
with
a
terror
that
made
him
awake
at
five
oclock
and
lie
sleepless
with
sickness
in
his
heart
the
girls
in
the
department
noticed
his
shamefaced
way
and
they
very
soon
discovered
his
trick
of
standing
with
his
back
to
the
street
they
laughed
at
him
and
called
him
sidey
i
suppose
youre
afraid
your
auntll
come
along
and
cut
you
out
of
her
will
on
the
whole
he
got
on
well
enough
with
the
girls
they
thought
him
a
little
queer
but
his
clubfoot
seemed
to
excuse
his
not
being
like
the
rest
and
they
found
in
due
course
that
he
was
goodnatured
he
never
minded
helping
anyone
and
he
was
polite
and
even
tempered
you
can
see
hes
a
gentleman
they
said
very
reserved
isnt
he
said
one
young
woman
to
whose
passionate
enthusiasm
for
the
theatre
he
had
listened
unmoved
most
of
them
had
fellers
and
those
who
hadnt
said
they
had
rather
than
have
it
supposed
that
no
one
had
an
inclination
for
them
one
or
two
showed
signs
of
being
willing
to
start
a
flirtation
with
philip
and
he
watched
their
manoeuvres
with
grave
amusement
he
had
had
enough
of
lovemaking
for
some
time
and
he
was
nearly
always
tired
and
often
hungry
chapter
cvi
philip
avoided
the
places
he
had
known
in
happier
times
the
little
gatherings
at
the
tavern
in
beak
street
were
broken
up
macalister
having
let
down
his
friends
no
longer
went
there
and
hayward
was
at
the
cape
only
lawson
remained
and
philip
feeling
that
now
the
painter
and
he
had
nothing
in
common
did
not
wish
to
see
him
but
one
saturday
afternoon
after
dinner
having
changed
his
clothes
he
walked
down
regent
street
to
go
to
the
free
library
in
st
martins
lane
meaning
to
spend
the
afternoon
there
and
suddenly
found
himself
face
to
face
with
him
his
first
instinct
was
to
pass
on
without
a
word
but
lawson
did
not
give
him
the
opportunity
where
on
earth
have
you
been
all
this
time
he
cried
i
said
philip
i
wrote
you
and
asked
you
to
come
to
the
studio
for
a
beano
and
you
never
even
answered
i
didnt
get
your
letter
no
i
know
i
went
to
the
hospital
to
ask
for
you
and
i
saw
my
letter
in
the
rack
have
you
chucked
the
medical
philip
hesitated
for
a
moment
he
was
ashamed
to
tell
the
truth
but
the
shame
he
felt
angered
him
and
he
forced
himself
to
speak
he
could
not
help
reddening
yes
i
lost
the
little
money
i
had
i
couldnt
afford
to
go
on
with
it
i
say
im
awfully
sorry
what
are
you
doing
im
a
shopwalker
the
words
choked
philip
but
he
was
determined
not
to
shirk
the
truth
he
kept
his
eyes
on
lawson
and
saw
his
embarrassment
philip
smiled
savagely
if
you
went
into
lynn
and
sedley
and
made
your
way
into
the
made
robes
department
you
would
see
me
in
a
frock
coat
walking
about
with
a
degage
air
and
directing
ladies
who
want
to
buy
petticoats
or
stockings
first
to
the
right
madam
and
second
on
the
left
lawson
seeing
that
philip
was
making
a
jest
of
it
laughed
awkwardly
he
did
not
know
what
to
say
the
picture
that
philip
called
up
horrified
him
but
he
was
afraid
to
show
his
sympathy
thats
a
bit
of
a
change
for
you
he
said
his
words
seemed
absurd
to
him
and
immediately
he
wished
he
had
not
said
them
philip
flushed
darkly
a
bit
he
said
by
the
way
i
owe
you
five
bob
he
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
and
pulled
out
some
silver
oh
it
doesnt
matter
id
forgotten
all
about
it
go
on
take
it
lawson
received
the
money
silently
they
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
pavement
and
people
jostled
them
as
they
passed
there
was
a
sardonic
twinkle
in
philips
eyes
which
made
the
painter
intensely
uncomfortable
and
he
could
not
tell
that
philips
heart
was
heavy
with
despair
lawson
wanted
dreadfully
to
do
something
but
he
did
not
know
what
to
do
i
say
wont
you
come
to
the
studio
and
have
a
talk
no
said
philip
why
not
theres
nothing
to
talk
about
he
saw
the
pain
come
into
lawsons
eyes
he
could
not
help
it
he
was
sorry
but
he
had
to
think
of
himself
he
could
not
bear
the
thought
of
discussing
his
situation
he
could
endure
it
only
by
determining
resolutely
not
to
think
about
it
he
was
afraid
of
his
weakness
if
once
he
began
to
open
his
heart
moreover
he
took
irresistible
dislikes
to
the
places
where
he
had
been
miserable
he
remembered
the
humiliation
he
had
endured
when
he
had
waited
in
that
studio
ravenous
with
hunger
for
lawson
to
offer
him
a
meal
and
the
last
occasion
when
he
had
taken
the
five
shillings
off
him
he
hated
the
sight
of
lawson
because
he
recalled
those
days
of
utter
abasement
then
look
here
come
and
dine
with
me
one
night
choose
your
own
evening
philip
was
touched
with
the
painters
kindness
all
sorts
of
people
were
strangely
kind
to
him
he
thought
its
awfully
good
of
you
old
man
but
id
rather
not
he
held
out
his
hand
goodbye
lawson
troubled
by
a
behaviour
which
seemed
inexplicable
took
his
hand
and
philip
quickly
limped
away
his
heart
was
heavy
and
as
was
usual
with
him
he
began
to
reproach
himself
for
what
he
had
done
he
did
not
know
what
madness
of
pride
had
made
him
refuse
the
offered
friendship
but
he
heard
someone
running
behind
him
and
presently
lawsons
voice
calling
him
he
stopped
and
suddenly
the
feeling
of
hostility
got
the
better
of
him
he
presented
to
lawson
a
cold
set
face
what
is
it
i
suppose
you
heard
about
hayward
didnt
you
i
know
he
went
to
the
cape
he
died
you
know
soon
after
landing
for
a
moment
philip
did
not
answer
he
could
hardly
believe
his
ears
how
he
asked
oh
enteric
hard
luck
wasnt
it
i
thought
you
mightnt
know
gave
me
a
bit
of
a
turn
when
i
heard
it
lawson
nodded
quickly
and
walked
away
philip
felt
a
shiver
pass
through
his
heart
he
had
never
before
lost
a
friend
of
his
own
age
for
the
death
of
cronshaw
a
man
so
much
older
than
himself
had
seemed
to
come
in
the
normal
course
of
things
the
news
gave
him
a
peculiar
shock
it
reminded
him
of
his
own
mortality
for
like
everyone
else
philip
knowing
perfectly
that
all
men
must
die
had
no
intimate
feeling
that
the
same
must
apply
to
himself
and
haywards
death
though
he
had
long
ceased
to
have
any
warm
feeling
for
him
affected
him
deeply
he
remembered
on
a
sudden
all
the
good
talks
they
had
had
and
it
pained
him
to
think
that
they
would
never
talk
with
one
another
again
he
remembered
their
first
meeting
and
the
pleasant
months
they
had
spent
together
in
heidelberg
philips
heart
sank
as
he
thought
of
the
lost
years
he
walked
on
mechanically
not
noticing
where
he
went
and
realised
suddenly
with
a
movement
of
irritation
that
instead
of
turning
down
the
haymarket
he
had
sauntered
along
shaftesbury
avenue
it
bored
him
to
retrace
his
steps
and
besides
with
that
news
he
did
not
want
to
read
he
wanted
to
sit
alone
and
think
he
made
up
his
mind
to
go
to
the
british
museum
solitude
was
now
his
only
luxury
since
he
had
been
at
lynns
he
had
often
gone
there
and
sat
in
front
of
the
groups
from
the
parthenon
and
not
deliberately
thinking
had
allowed
their
divine
masses
to
rest
his
troubled
soul
but
this
afternoon
they
had
nothing
to
say
to
him
and
after
a
few
minutes
impatiently
he
wandered
out
of
the
room
there
were
too
many
people
provincials
with
foolish
faces
foreigners
poring
over
guidebooks
their
hideousness
besmirched
the
everlasting
masterpieces
their
restlessness
troubled
the
gods
immortal
repose
he
went
into
another
room
and
here
there
was
hardly
anyone
philip
sat
down
wearily
his
nerves
were
on
edge
he
could
not
get
the
people
out
of
his
mind
sometimes
at
lynns
they
affected
him
in
the
same
way
and
he
looked
at
them
file
past
him
with
horror
they
were
so
ugly
and
there
was
such
meanness
in
their
faces
it
was
terrifying
their
features
were
distorted
with
paltry
desires
and
you
felt
they
were
strange
to
any
ideas
of
beauty
they
had
furtive
eyes
and
weak
chins
there
was
no
wickedness
in
them
but
only
pettiness
and
vulgarity
their
humour
was
a
low
facetiousness
sometimes
he
found
himself
looking
at
them
to
see
what
animal
they
resembled
he
tried
not
to
for
it
quickly
became
an
obsession
and
he
saw
in
them
all
the
sheep
or
the
horse
or
the
fox
or
the
goat
human
beings
filled
him
with
disgust
but
presently
the
influence
of
the
place
descended
upon
him
he
felt
quieter
he
began
to
look
absently
at
the
tombstones
with
which
the
room
was
lined
they
were
the
work
of
athenian
stone
masons
of
the
fourth
and
fifth
centuries
before
christ
and
they
were
very
simple
work
of
no
great
talent
but
with
the
exquisite
spirit
of
athens
upon
them
time
had
mellowed
the
marble
to
the
colour
of
honey
so
that
unconsciously
one
thought
of
the
bees
of
hymettus
and
softened
their
outlines
some
represented
a
nude
figure
seated
on
a
bench
some
the
departure
of
the
dead
from
those
who
loved
him
and
some
the
dead
clasping
hands
with
one
who
remained
behind
on
all
was
the
tragic
word
farewell
that
and
nothing
more
their
simplicity
was
infinitely
touching
friend
parted
from
friend
the
son
from
his
mother
and
the
restraint
made
the
survivors
grief
more
poignant
it
was
so
long
long
ago
and
century
upon
century
had
passed
over
that
unhappiness
for
two
thousand
years
those
who
wept
had
been
dust
as
those
they
wept
for
yet
the
woe
was
alive
still
and
it
filled
philips
heart
so
that
he
felt
compassion
spring
up
in
it
and
he
said
poor
things
poor
things
and
it
came
to
him
that
the
gaping
sightseers
and
the
fat
strangers
with
their
guidebooks
and
all
those
mean
common
people
who
thronged
the
shop
with
their
trivial
desires
and
vulgar
cares
were
mortal
and
must
die
they
too
loved
and
must
part
from
those
they
loved
the
son
from
his
mother
the
wife
from
her
husband
and
perhaps
it
was
more
tragic
because
their
lives
were
ugly
and
sordid
and
they
knew
nothing
that
gave
beauty
to
the
world
there
was
one
stone
which
was
very
beautiful
a
bas
relief
of
two
young
men
holding
each
others
hand
and
the
reticence
of
line
the
simplicity
made
one
like
to
think
that
the
sculptor
here
had
been
touched
with
a
genuine
emotion
it
was
an
exquisite
memorial
to
that
than
which
the
world
offers
but
one
thing
more
precious
to
a
friendship
and
as
philip
looked
at
it
he
felt
the
tears
come
to
his
eyes
he
thought
of
hayward
and
his
eager
admiration
for
him
when
first
they
met
and
how
disillusion
had
come
and
then
indifference
till
nothing
held
them
together
but
habit
and
old
memories
it
was
one
of
the
queer
things
of
life
that
you
saw
a
person
every
day
for
months
and
were
so
intimate
with
him
that
you
could
not
imagine
existence
without
him
then
separation
came
and
everything
went
on
in
the
same
way
and
the
companion
who
had
seemed
essential
proved
unnecessary
your
life
proceeded
and
you
did
not
even
miss
him
philip
thought
of
those
early
days
in
heidelberg
when
hayward
capable
of
great
things
had
been
full
of
enthusiasm
for
the
future
and
how
little
by
little
achieving
nothing
he
had
resigned
himself
to
failure
now
he
was
dead
his
death
had
been
as
futile
as
his
life
he
died
ingloriously
of
a
stupid
disease
failing
once
more
even
at
the
end
to
accomplish
anything
it
was
just
the
same
now
as
if
he
had
never
lived
philip
asked
himself
desperately
what
was
the
use
of
living
at
all
it
all
seemed
inane
it
was
the
same
with
cronshaw
it
was
quite
unimportant
that
he
had
lived
he
was
dead
and
forgotten
his
book
of
poems
sold
in
remainder
by
secondhand
booksellers
his
life
seemed
to
have
served
nothing
except
to
give
a
pushing
journalist
occasion
to
write
an
article
in
a
review
and
philip
cried
out
in
his
soul
what
is
the
use
of
it
the
effort
was
so
incommensurate
with
the
result
the
bright
hopes
of
youth
had
to
be
paid
for
at
such
a
bitter
price
of
disillusionment
pain
and
disease
and
unhappiness
weighed
down
the
scale
so
heavily
what
did
it
all
mean
he
thought
of
his
own
life
the
high
hopes
with
which
he
had
entered
upon
it
the
limitations
which
his
body
forced
upon
him
his
friendlessness
and
the
lack
of
affection
which
had
surrounded
his
youth
he
did
not
know
that
he
had
ever
done
anything
but
what
seemed
best
to
do
and
what
a
cropper
he
had
come
other
men
with
no
more
advantages
than
he
succeeded
and
others
again
with
many
more
failed
it
seemed
pure
chance
the
rain
fell
alike
upon
the
just
and
upon
the
unjust
and
for
nothing
was
there
a
why
and
a
wherefore
thinking
of
cronshaw
philip
remembered
the
persian
rug
which
he
had
given
him
telling
him
that
it
offered
an
answer
to
his
question
upon
the
meaning
of
life
and
suddenly
the
answer
occurred
to
him
he
chuckled
now
that
he
had
it
it
was
like
one
of
the
puzzles
which
you
worry
over
till
you
are
shown
the
solution
and
then
cannot
imagine
how
it
could
ever
have
escaped
you
the
answer
was
obvious
life
had
no
meaning
on
the
earth
satellite
of
a
star
speeding
through
space
living
things
had
arisen
under
the
influence
of
conditions
which
were
part
of
the
planets
history
and
as
there
had
been
a
beginning
of
life
upon
it
so
under
the
influence
of
other
conditions
there
would
be
an
end
man
no
more
significant
than
other
forms
of
life
had
come
not
as
the
climax
of
creation
but
as
a
physical
reaction
to
the
environment
philip
remembered
the
story
of
the
eastern
king
who
desiring
to
know
the
history
of
man
was
brought
by
a
sage
five
hundred
volumes
busy
with
affairs
of
state
he
bade
him
go
and
condense
it
in
twenty
years
the
sage
returned
and
his
history
now
was
in
no
more
than
fifty
volumes
but
the
king
too
old
then
to
read
so
many
ponderous
tomes
bade
him
go
and
shorten
it
once
more
twenty
years
passed
again
and
the
sage
old
and
gray
brought
a
single
book
in
which
was
the
knowledge
the
king
had
sought
but
the
king
lay
on
his
deathbed
and
he
had
no
time
to
read
even
that
and
then
the
sage
gave
him
the
history
of
man
in
a
single
line
it
was
this
he
was
born
he
suffered
and
he
died
there
was
no
meaning
in
life
and
man
by
living
served
no
end
it
was
immaterial
whether
he
was
born
or
not
born
whether
he
lived
or
ceased
to
live
life
was
insignificant
and
death
without
consequence
philip
exulted
as
he
had
exulted
in
his
boyhood
when
the
weight
of
a
belief
in
god
was
lifted
from
his
shoulders
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
last
burden
of
responsibility
was
taken
from
him
and
for
the
first
time
he
was
utterly
free
his
insignificance
was
turned
to
power
and
he
felt
himself
suddenly
equal
with
the
cruel
fate
which
had
seemed
to
persecute
him
for
if
life
was
meaningless
the
world
was
robbed
of
its
cruelty
what
he
did
or
left
undone
did
not
matter
failure
was
unimportant
and
success
amounted
to
nothing
he
was
the
most
inconsiderate
creature
in
that
swarming
mass
of
mankind
which
for
a
brief
space
occupied
the
surface
of
the
earth
and
he
was
almighty
because
he
had
wrenched
from
chaos
the
secret
of
its
nothingness
thoughts
came
tumbling
over
one
another
in
philips
eager
fancy
and
he
took
long
breaths
of
joyous
satisfaction
he
felt
inclined
to
leap
and
sing
he
had
not
been
so
happy
for
months
oh
life
he
cried
in
his
heart
oh
life
where
is
thy
sting
for
the
same
uprush
of
fancy
which
had
shown
him
with
all
the
force
of
mathematical
demonstration
that
life
had
no
meaning
brought
with
it
another
idea
and
that
was
why
cronshaw
he
imagined
had
given
him
the
persian
rug
as
the
weaver
elaborated
his
pattern
for
no
end
but
the
pleasure
of
his
aesthetic
sense
so
might
a
man
live
his
life
or
if
one
was
forced
to
believe
that
his
actions
were
outside
his
choosing
so
might
a
man
look
at
his
life
that
it
made
a
pattern
there
was
as
little
need
to
do
this
as
there
was
use
it
was
merely
something
he
did
for
his
own
pleasure
out
of
the
manifold
events
of
his
life
his
deeds
his
feelings
his
thoughts
he
might
make
a
design
regular
elaborate
complicated
or
beautiful
and
though
it
might
be
no
more
than
an
illusion
that
he
had
the
power
of
selection
though
it
might
be
no
more
than
a
fantastic
legerdemain
in
which
appearances
were
interwoven
with
moonbeams
that
did
not
matter
it
seemed
and
so
to
him
it
was
in
the
vast
warp
of
life
a
river
arising
from
no
spring
and
flowing
endlessly
to
no
sea
with
the
background
to
his
fancies
that
there
was
no
meaning
and
that
nothing
was
important
a
man
might
get
a
personal
satisfaction
in
selecting
the
various
strands
that
worked
out
the
pattern
there
was
one
pattern
the
most
obvious
perfect
and
beautiful
in
which
a
man
was
born
grew
to
manhood
married
produced
children
toiled
for
his
bread
and
died
but
there
were
others
intricate
and
wonderful
in
which
happiness
did
not
enter
and
in
which
success
was
not
attempted
and
in
them
might
be
discovered
a
more
troubling
grace
some
lives
and
haywards
was
among
them
the
blind
indifference
of
chance
cut
off
while
the
design
was
still
imperfect
and
then
the
solace
was
comfortable
that
it
did
not
matter
other
lives
such
as
cronshaws
offered
a
pattern
which
was
difficult
to
follow
the
point
of
view
had
to
be
shifted
and
old
standards
had
to
be
altered
before
one
could
understand
that
such
a
life
was
its
own
justification
philip
thought
that
in
throwing
over
the
desire
for
happiness
he
was
casting
aside
the
last
of
his
illusions
his
life
had
seemed
horrible
when
it
was
measured
by
its
happiness
but
now
he
seemed
to
gather
strength
as
he
realised
that
it
might
be
measured
by
something
else
happiness
mattered
as
little
as
pain
they
came
in
both
of
them
as
all
the
other
details
of
his
life
came
in
to
the
elaboration
of
the
design
he
seemed
for
an
instant
to
stand
above
the
accidents
of
his
existence
and
he
felt
that
they
could
not
affect
him
again
as
they
had
done
before
whatever
happened
to
him
now
would
be
one
more
motive
to
add
to
the
complexity
of
the
pattern
and
when
the
end
approached
he
would
rejoice
in
its
completion
it
would
be
a
work
of
art
and
it
would
be
none
the
less
beautiful
because
he
alone
knew
of
its
existence
and
with
his
death
it
would
at
once
cease
to
be
philip
was
happy
chapter
cvii
mr
sampson
the
buyer
took
a
fancy
to
philip
mr
sampson
was
very
dashing
and
the
girls
in
his
department
said
they
would
not
be
surprised
if
he
married
one
of
the
rich
customers
he
lived
out
of
town
and
often
impressed
the
assistants
by
putting
on
his
evening
clothes
in
the
office
sometimes
he
would
be
seen
by
those
on
sweeping
duty
coming
in
next
morning
still
dressed
and
they
would
wink
gravely
to
one
another
while
he
went
into
his
office
and
changed
into
a
frock
coat
on
these
occasions
having
slipped
out
for
a
hurried
breakfast
he
also
would
wink
at
philip
as
he
walked
up
the
stairs
on
his
way
back
and
rub
his
hands
what
a
night
what
a
night
he
said
my
word
he
told
philip
that
he
was
the
only
gentleman
there
and
he
and
philip
were
the
only
fellows
who
knew
what
life
was
having
said
this
he
changed
his
manner
suddenly
called
philip
mr
carey
instead
of
old
boy
assumed
the
importance
due
to
his
position
as
buyer
and
put
philip
back
into
his
place
of
shopwalker
lynn
and
sedley
received
fashion
papers
from
paris
once
a
week
and
adapted
the
costumes
illustrated
in
them
to
the
needs
of
their
customers
their
clientele
was
peculiar
the
most
substantial
part
consisted
of
women
from
the
smaller
manufacturing
towns
who
were
too
elegant
to
have
their
frocks
made
locally
and
not
sufficiently
acquainted
with
london
to
discover
good
dressmakers
within
their
means
beside
these
incongruously
was
a
large
number
of
musichall
artistes
this
was
a
connection
that
mr
sampson
had
worked
up
for
himself
and
took
great
pride
in
they
had
begun
by
getting
their
stagecostumes
at
lynns
and
he
had
induced
many
of
them
to
get
their
other
clothes
there
as
well
as
good
as
paquin
and
half
the
price
he
said
he
had
a
persuasive
hailfellow
wellmet
air
with
him
which
appealed
to
customers
of
this
sort
and
they
said
to
one
another
whats
the
good
of
throwing
money
away
when
you
can
get
a
coat
and
skirt
at
lynns
that
nobody
knows
dont
come
from
paris
mr
sampson
was
very
proud
of
his
friendship
with
the
popular
favourites
whose
frocks
he
made
and
when
he
went
out
to
dinner
at
two
oclock
on
sunday
with
miss
victoria
virgoshe
was
wearing
that
powder
blue
we
made
her
and
i
lay
she
didnt
let
on
it
come
from
us
i
ad
to
tell
her
meself
that
if
i
adnt
designed
it
with
my
own
ands
id
have
said
it
must
come
from
paquinat
her
beautiful
house
in
tulse
hill
he
regaled
the
department
next
day
with
abundant
details
philip
had
never
paid
much
attention
to
womens
clothes
but
in
course
of
time
he
began
a
little
amused
at
himself
to
take
a
technical
interest
in
them
he
had
an
eye
for
colour
which
was
more
highly
trained
than
that
of
anyone
in
the
department
and
he
had
kept
from
his
student
days
in
paris
some
knowledge
of
line
mr
sampson
an
ignorant
man
conscious
of
his
incompetence
but
with
a
shrewdness
that
enabled
him
to
combine
other
peoples
suggestions
constantly
asked
the
opinion
of
the
assistants
in
his
department
in
making
up
new
designs
and
he
had
the
quickness
to
see
that
philips
criticisms
were
valuable
but
he
was
very
jealous
and
would
never
allow
that
he
took
anyones
advice
when
he
had
altered
some
drawing
in
accordance
with
philips
suggestion
he
always
finished
up
by
saying
well
it
comes
round
to
my
own
idea
in
the
end
one
day
when
philip
had
been
at
the
shop
for
five
months
miss
alice
antonia
the
wellknown
seriocomic
came
in
and
asked
to
see
mr
sampson
she
was
a
large
woman
with
flaxen
hair
and
a
boldly
painted
face
a
metallic
voice
and
the
breezy
manner
of
a
comedienne
accustomed
to
be
on
friendly
terms
with
the
gallery
boys
of
provincial
musichalls
she
had
a
new
song
and
wished
mr
sampson
to
design
a
costume
for
her
i
want
something
striking
she
said
i
dont
want
any
old
thing
you
know
i
want
something
different
from
what
anybody
else
has
mr
sampson
bland
and
familiar
said
he
was
quite
certain
they
could
get
her
the
very
thing
she
required
he
showed
her
sketches
i
know
theres
nothing
here
that
would
do
but
i
just
want
to
show
you
the
kind
of
thing
i
would
suggest
oh
no
thats
not
the
sort
of
thing
at
all
she
said
as
she
glanced
at
them
impatiently
what
i
want
is
something
thatll
just
hit
em
in
the
jaw
and
make
their
front
teeth
rattle
yes
i
quite
understand
miss
antonia
said
the
buyer
with
a
bland
smile
but
his
eyes
grew
blank
and
stupid
i
expect
i
shall
ave
to
pop
over
to
paris
for
it
in
the
end
oh
i
think
we
can
give
you
satisfaction
miss
antonia
what
you
can
get
in
paris
you
can
get
here
when
she
had
swept
out
of
the
department
mr
sampson
a
little
worried
discussed
the
matter
with
mrs
hodges
shes
a
caution
and
no
mistake
said
mrs
hodges
alice
where
art
thou
remarked
the
buyer
irritably
and
thought
he
had
scored
a
point
against
her
his
ideas
of
musichall
costumes
had
never
gone
beyond
short
skirts
a
swirl
of
lace
and
glittering
sequins
but
miss
antonia
had
expressed
herself
on
that
subject
in
no
uncertain
terms
oh
my
aunt
she
said
and
the
invocation
was
uttered
in
such
a
tone
as
to
indicate
a
rooted
antipathy
to
anything
so
commonplace
even
if
she
had
not
added
that
sequins
gave
her
the
sick
mr
sampson
got
out
one
or
two
ideas
but
mrs
hodges
told
him
frankly
she
did
not
think
they
would
do
it
was
she
who
gave
philip
the
suggestion
can
you
draw
phil
why
dont
you
try
your
and
and
see
what
you
can
do
philip
bought
a
cheap
box
of
water
colours
and
in
the
evening
while
bell
the
noisy
lad
of
sixteen
whistling
three
notes
busied
himself
with
his
stamps
he
made
one
or
two
sketches
he
remembered
some
of
the
costumes
he
had
seen
in
paris
and
he
adapted
one
of
them
getting
his
effect
from
a
combination
of
violent
unusual
colours
the
result
amused
him
and
next
morning
he
showed
it
to
mrs
hodges
she
was
somewhat
astonished
but
took
it
at
once
to
the
buyer
its
unusual
he
said
theres
no
denying
that
it
puzzled
him
and
at
the
same
time
his
trained
eye
saw
that
it
would
make
up
admirably
to
save
his
face
he
began
making
suggestions
for
altering
it
but
mrs
hodges
with
more
sense
advised
him
to
show
it
to
miss
antonia
as
it
was
its
neck
or
nothing
with
her
and
she
may
take
a
fancy
to
it
its
a
good
deal
more
nothing
than
neck
said
mr
sampson
looking
at
the
decolletage
he
can
draw
cant
he
fancy
im
keeping
it
dark
all
this
time
when
miss
antonia
was
announced
the
buyer
placed
the
design
on
the
table
in
such
a
position
that
it
must
catch
her
eye
the
moment
she
was
shown
into
his
office
she
pounced
on
it
at
once
whats
that
she
said
why
cant
i
ave
that
thats
just
an
idea
we
got
out
for
you
said
mr
sampson
casually
dyou
like
it
do
i
like
it
she
said
give
me
alf
a
pint
with
a
little
drop
of
gin
in
it
ah
you
see
you
dont
have
to
go
to
paris
youve
only
got
to
say
what
you
want
and
there
you
are
the
work
was
put
in
hand
at
once
and
philip
felt
quite
a
thrill
of
satisfaction
when
he
saw
the
costume
completed
the
buyer
and
mrs
hodges
took
all
the
credit
of
it
but
he
did
not
care
and
when
he
went
with
them
to
the
tivoli
to
see
miss
antonia
wear
it
for
the
first
time
he
was
filled
with
elation
in
answer
to
her
questions
he
at
last
told
mrs
hodges
how
he
had
learnt
to
drawfearing
that
the
people
he
lived
with
would
think
he
wanted
to
put
on
airs
he
had
always
taken
the
greatest
care
to
say
nothing
about
his
past
occupationsand
she
repeated
the
information
to
mr
sampson
the
buyer
said
nothing
to
him
on
the
subject
but
began
to
treat
him
a
little
more
deferentially
and
presently
gave
him
designs
to
do
for
two
of
the
country
customers
they
met
with
satisfaction
then
he
began
to
speak
to
his
clients
of
a
clever
young
feller
paris
artstudent
you
know
who
worked
for
him
and
soon
philip
ensconced
behind
a
screen
in
his
shirt
sleeves
was
drawing
from
morning
till
night
sometimes
he
was
so
busy
that
he
had
to
dine
at
three
with
the
stragglers
he
liked
it
because
there
were
few
of
them
and
they
were
all
too
tired
to
talk
the
food
also
was
better
for
it
consisted
of
what
was
left
over
from
the
buyers
table
philips
rise
from
shopwalker
to
designer
of
costumes
had
a
great
effect
on
the
department
he
realised
that
he
was
an
object
of
envy
harris
the
assistant
with
the
queershaped
head
who
was
the
first
person
he
had
known
at
the
shop
and
had
attached
himself
to
philip
could
not
conceal
his
bitterness
some
people
ave
all
the
luck
he
said
youll
be
a
buyer
yourself
one
of
these
days
and
we
shall
all
be
calling
you
sir
he
told
philip
that
he
should
demand
higher
wages
for
notwithstanding
the
difficult
work
he
was
now
engaged
in
he
received
no
more
than
the
six
shillings
a
week
with
which
he
started
but
it
was
a
ticklish
matter
to
ask
for
a
rise
the
manager
had
a
sardonic
way
of
dealing
with
such
applicants
think
youre
worth
more
do
you
how
much
dyou
think
youre
worth
eh
the
assistant
with
his
heart
in
his
mouth
would
suggest
that
he
thought
he
ought
to
have
another
two
shillings
a
week
oh
very
well
if
you
think
youre
worth
it
you
can
ave
it
then
he
paused
and
sometimes
with
a
steely
eye
added
and
you
can
ave
your
notice
too
it
was
no
use
then
to
withdraw
your
request
you
had
to
go
the
managers
idea
was
that
assistants
who
were
dissatisfied
did
not
work
properly
and
if
they
were
not
worth
a
rise
it
was
better
to
sack
them
at
once
the
result
was
that
they
never
asked
for
one
unless
they
were
prepared
to
leave
philip
hesitated
he
was
a
little
suspicious
of
the
men
in
his
room
who
told
him
that
the
buyer
could
not
do
without
him
they
were
decent
fellows
but
their
sense
of
humour
was
primitive
and
it
would
have
seemed
funny
to
them
if
they
had
persuaded
philip
to
ask
for
more
wages
and
he
were
sacked
he
could
not
forget
the
mortification
he
had
suffered
in
looking
for
work
he
did
not
wish
to
expose
himself
to
that
again
and
he
knew
there
was
small
chance
of
his
getting
elsewhere
a
post
as
designer
there
were
hundreds
of
people
about
who
could
draw
as
well
as
he
but
he
wanted
money
very
badly
his
clothes
were
worn
out
and
the
heavy
carpets
rotted
his
socks
and
boots
he
had
almost
persuaded
himself
to
take
the
venturesome
step
when
one
morning
passing
up
from
breakfast
in
the
basement
through
the
passage
that
led
to
the
managers
office
he
saw
a
queue
of
men
waiting
in
answer
to
an
advertisement
there
were
about
a
hundred
of
them
and
whichever
was
engaged
would
be
offered
his
keep
and
the
same
six
shillings
a
week
that
philip
had
he
saw
some
of
them
cast
envious
glances
at
him
because
he
had
employment
it
made
him
shudder
he
dared
not
risk
it
chapter
cviii
the
winter
passed
now
and
then
philip
went
to
the
hospital
slinking
in
when
it
was
late
and
there
was
little
chance
of
meeting
anyone
he
knew
to
see
whether
there
were
letters
for
him
at
easter
he
received
one
from
his
uncle
he
was
surprised
to
hear
from
him
for
the
vicar
of
blackstable
had
never
written
him
more
than
half
a
dozen
letters
in
his
whole
life
and
they
were
on
business
matters
dear
philip
if
you
are
thinking
of
taking
a
holiday
soon
and
care
to
come
down
here
i
shall
be
pleased
to
see
you
i
was
very
ill
with
my
bronchitis
in
the
winter
and
doctor
wigram
never
expected
me
to
pull
through
i
have
a
wonderful
constitution
and
i
made
thank
god
a
marvellous
recovery
yours
affectionately
william
carey
the
letter
made
philip
angry
how
did
his
uncle
think
he
was
living
he
did
not
even
trouble
to
inquire
he
might
have
starved
for
all
the
old
man
cared
but
as
he
walked
home
something
struck
him
he
stopped
under
a
lamppost
and
read
the
letter
again
the
handwriting
had
no
longer
the
businesslike
firmness
which
had
characterised
it
it
was
larger
and
wavering
perhaps
the
illness
had
shaken
him
more
than
he
was
willing
to
confess
and
he
sought
in
that
formal
note
to
express
a
yearning
to
see
the
only
relation
he
had
in
the
world
philip
wrote
back
that
he
could
come
down
to
blackstable
for
a
fortnight
in
july
the
invitation
was
convenient
for
he
had
not
known
what
to
do
with
his
brief
holiday
the
athelnys
went
hopping
in
september
but
he
could
not
then
be
spared
since
during
that
month
the
autumn
models
were
prepared
the
rule
of
lynns
was
that
everyone
must
take
a
fortnight
whether
he
wanted
it
or
not
and
during
that
time
if
he
had
nowhere
to
go
the
assistant
might
sleep
in
his
room
but
he
was
not
allowed
food
a
number
had
no
friends
within
reasonable
distance
of
london
and
to
these
the
holiday
was
an
awkward
interval
when
they
had
to
provide
food
out
of
their
small
wages
and
with
the
whole
day
on
their
hands
had
nothing
to
spend
philip
had
not
been
out
of
london
since
his
visit
to
brighton
with
mildred
now
two
years
before
and
he
longed
for
fresh
air
and
the
silence
of
the
sea
he
thought
of
it
with
such
a
passionate
desire
all
through
may
and
june
that
when
at
length
the
time
came
for
him
to
go
he
was
listless
on
his
last
evening
when
he
talked
with
the
buyer
of
one
or
two
jobs
he
had
to
leave
over
mr
sampson
suddenly
said
to
him
what
wages
have
you
been
getting
six
shillings
i
dont
think
its
enough
ill
see
that
youre
put
up
to
twelve
when
you
come
back
thank
you
very
much
smiled
philip
im
beginning
to
want
some
new
clothes
badly
if
you
stick
to
your
work
and
dont
go
larking
about
with
the
girls
like
what
some
of
them
do
ill
look
after
you
carey
mind
you
youve
got
a
lot
to
learn
but
youre
promising
ill
say
that
for
you
youre
promising
and
ill
see
that
you
get
a
pound
a
week
as
soon
as
you
deserve
it
philip
wondered
how
long
he
would
have
to
wait
for
that
two
years
he
was
startled
at
the
change
in
his
uncle
when
last
he
had
seen
him
he
was
a
stout
man
who
held
himself
upright
cleanshaven
with
a
round
sensual
face
but
he
had
fallen
in
strangely
his
skin
was
yellow
there
were
great
bags
under
the
eyes
and
he
was
bent
and
old
he
had
grown
a
beard
during
his
last
illness
and
he
walked
very
slowly
i
m
not
at
my
best
today
he
said
when
philip
having
just
arrived
was
sitting
with
him
in
the
diningroom
the
heat
upsets
me
philip
asking
after
the
affairs
of
the
parish
looked
at
him
and
wondered
how
much
longer
he
could
last
a
hot
summer
would
finish
him
philip
noticed
how
thin
his
hands
were
they
trembled
it
meant
so
much
to
philip
if
he
died
that
summer
he
could
go
back
to
the
hospital
at
the
beginning
of
the
winter
session
his
heart
leaped
at
the
thought
of
returning
no
more
to
lynns
at
dinner
the
vicar
sat
humped
up
on
his
chair
and
the
housekeeper
who
had
been
with
him
since
his
wifes
death
said
shall
mr
philip
carve
sir
the
old
man
who
had
been
about
to
do
so
from
disinclination
to
confess
his
weakness
seemed
glad
at
the
first
suggestion
to
relinquish
the
attempt
youve
got
a
very
good
appetite
said
philip
oh
yes
i
always
eat
well
but
im
thinner
than
when
you
were
here
last
im
glad
to
be
thinner
i
didnt
like
being
so
fat
dr
wigram
thinks
im
all
the
better
for
being
thinner
than
i
was
when
dinner
was
over
the
housekeeper
brought
him
some
medicine
show
the
prescription
to
master
philip
he
said
hes
a
doctor
too
id
like
him
to
see
that
he
thinks
its
all
right
i
told
dr
wigram
that
now
youre
studying
to
be
a
doctor
he
ought
to
make
a
reduction
in
his
charges
its
dreadful
the
bills
ive
had
to
pay
he
came
every
day
for
two
months
and
he
charges
five
shillings
a
visit
its
a
lot
of
money
isnt
it
he
comes
twice
a
week
still
im
going
to
tell
him
he
neednt
come
any
more
ill
send
for
him
if
i
want
him
he
looked
at
philip
eagerly
while
he
read
the
prescriptions
they
were
narcotics
there
were
two
of
them
and
one
was
a
medicine
which
the
vicar
explained
he
was
to
use
only
if
his
neuritis
grew
unendurable
im
very
careful
he
said
i
dont
want
to
get
into
the
opium
habit
he
did
not
mention
his
nephews
affairs
philip
fancied
that
it
was
by
way
of
precaution
in
case
he
asked
for
money
that
his
uncle
kept
dwelling
on
the
financial
calls
upon
him
he
had
spent
so
much
on
the
doctor
and
so
much
more
on
the
chemist
while
he
was
ill
they
had
had
to
have
a
fire
every
day
in
his
bedroom
and
now
on
sunday
he
needed
a
carriage
to
go
to
church
in
the
evening
as
well
as
in
the
morning
philip
felt
angrily
inclined
to
say
he
need
not
be
afraid
he
was
not
going
to
borrow
from
him
but
he
held
his
tongue
it
seemed
to
him
that
everything
had
left
the
old
man
now
but
two
things
pleasure
in
his
food
and
a
grasping
desire
for
money
it
was
a
hideous
old
age
in
the
afternoon
dr
wigram
came
and
after
the
visit
philip
walked
with
him
to
the
garden
gate
how
dyou
think
he
is
said
philip
dr
wigram
was
more
anxious
not
to
do
wrong
than
to
do
right
and
he
never
hazarded
a
definite
opinion
if
he
could
help
it
he
had
practised
at
blackstable
for
fiveandthirty
years
he
had
the
reputation
of
being
very
safe
and
many
of
his
patients
thought
it
much
better
that
a
doctor
should
be
safe
than
clever
there
was
a
new
man
at
blackstablehe
had
been
settled
there
for
ten
years
but
they
still
looked
upon
him
as
an
interloperand
he
was
said
to
be
very
clever
but
he
had
not
much
practice
among
the
better
people
because
no
one
really
knew
anything
about
him
oh
hes
as
well
as
can
be
expected
said
dr
wigram
in
answer
to
philips
inquiry
has
he
got
anything
seriously
the
matter
with
him
well
philip
your
uncle
is
no
longer
a
young
man
said
the
doctor
with
a
cautious
little
smile
which
suggested
that
after
all
the
vicar
of
blackstable
was
not
an
old
man
either
he
seems
to
think
his
hearts
in
a
bad
way
im
not
satisfied
with
his
heart
hazarded
the
doctor
i
think
he
should
be
careful
very
careful
on
the
tip
of
philips
tongue
was
the
question
how
much
longer
can
he
live
he
was
afraid
it
would
shock
in
these
matters
a
periphrase
was
demanded
by
the
decorum
of
life
but
as
he
asked
another
question
instead
it
flashed
through
him
that
the
doctor
must
be
accustomed
to
the
impatience
of
a
sick
mans
relatives
he
must
see
through
their
sympathetic
expressions
philip
with
a
faint
smile
at
his
own
hypocrisy
cast
down
his
eyes
i
suppose
hes
in
no
immediate
danger
this
was
the
kind
of
question
the
doctor
hated
if
you
said
a
patient
couldnt
live
another
month
the
family
prepared
itself
for
a
bereavement
and
if
then
the
patient
lived
on
they
visited
the
medical
attendant
with
the
resentment
they
felt
at
having
tormented
themselves
before
it
was
necessary
on
the
other
hand
if
you
said
the
patient
might
live
a
year
and
he
died
in
a
week
the
family
said
you
did
not
know
your
business
they
thought
of
all
the
affection
they
would
have
lavished
on
the
defunct
if
they
had
known
the
end
was
so
near
dr
wigram
made
the
gesture
of
washing
his
hands
i
dont
think
theres
any
grave
risk
so
long
as
heremains
as
he
is
he
ventured
at
last
but
on
the
other
hand
we
mustnt
forget
that
hes
no
longer
a
young
man
and
well
the
machine
is
wearing
out
if
he
gets
over
the
hot
weather
i
dont
see
why
he
shouldnt
get
on
very
comfortably
till
the
winter
and
then
if
the
winter
does
not
bother
him
too
much
well
i
dont
see
why
anything
should
happen
philip
went
back
to
the
diningroom
where
his
uncle
was
sitting
with
his
skullcap
and
a
crochet
shawl
over
his
shoulders
he
looked
grotesque
his
eyes
had
been
fixed
on
the
door
and
they
rested
on
philips
face
as
he
entered
philip
saw
that
his
uncle
had
been
waiting
anxiously
for
his
return
well
what
did
he
say
about
me
philip
understood
suddenly
that
the
old
man
was
frightened
of
dying
it
made
philip
a
little
ashamed
so
that
he
looked
away
involuntarily
he
was
always
embarrassed
by
the
weakness
of
human
nature
he
says
he
thinks
youre
much
better
said
philip
a
gleam
of
delight
came
into
his
uncles
eyes
ive
got
a
wonderful
constitution
he
said
what
else
did
he
say
he
added
suspiciously
philip
smiled
he
said
that
if
you
take
care
of
yourself
theres
no
reason
why
you
shouldnt
live
to
be
a
hundred
i
dont
know
that
i
can
expect
to
do
that
but
i
dont
see
why
i
shouldnt
see
eighty
my
mother
lived
till
she
was
eightyfour
there
was
a
little
table
by
the
side
of
mr
careys
chair
and
on
it
were
a
bible
and
the
large
volume
of
the
common
prayer
from
which
for
so
many
years
he
had
been
accustomed
to
read
to
his
household
he
stretched
out
now
his
shaking
hand
and
took
his
bible
those
old
patriarchs
lived
to
a
jolly
good
old
age
didnt
they
he
said
with
a
queer
little
laugh
in
which
philip
read
a
sort
of
timid
appeal
the
old
man
clung
to
life
yet
he
believed
implicitly
all
that
his
religion
taught
him
he
had
no
doubt
in
the
immortality
of
the
soul
and
he
felt
that
he
had
conducted
himself
well
enough
according
to
his
capacities
to
make
it
very
likely
that
he
would
go
to
heaven
in
his
long
career
to
how
many
dying
persons
must
he
have
administered
the
consolations
of
religion
perhaps
he
was
like
the
doctor
who
could
get
no
benefit
from
his
own
prescriptions
philip
was
puzzled
and
shocked
by
that
eager
cleaving
to
the
earth
he
wondered
what
nameless
horror
was
at
the
back
of
the
old
mans
mind
he
would
have
liked
to
probe
into
his
soul
so
that
he
might
see
in
its
nakedness
the
dreadful
dismay
of
the
unknown
which
he
suspected
the
fortnight
passed
quickly
and
philip
returned
to
london
he
passed
a
sweltering
august
behind
his
screen
in
the
costumes
department
drawing
in
his
shirt
sleeves
the
assistants
in
relays
went
for
their
holidays
in
the
evening
philip
generally
went
into
hyde
park
and
listened
to
the
band
growing
more
accustomed
to
his
work
it
tired
him
less
and
his
mind
recovering
from
its
long
stagnation
sought
for
fresh
activity
his
whole
desire
now
was
set
on
his
uncles
death
he
kept
on
dreaming
the
same
dream
a
telegram
was
handed
to
him
one
morning
early
which
announced
the
vicars
sudden
demise
and
freedom
was
in
his
grasp
when
he
awoke
and
found
it
was
nothing
but
a
dream
he
was
filled
with
sombre
rage
he
occupied
himself
now
that
the
event
seemed
likely
to
happen
at
any
time
with
elaborate
plans
for
the
future
in
these
he
passed
rapidly
over
the
year
which
he
must
spend
before
it
was
possible
for
him
to
be
qualified
and
dwelt
on
the
journey
to
spain
on
which
his
heart
was
set
he
read
books
about
that
country
which
he
borrowed
from
the
free
library
and
already
he
knew
from
photographs
exactly
what
each
city
looked
like
he
saw
himself
lingering
in
cordova
on
the
bridge
that
spanned
the
gaudalquivir
he
wandered
through
tortuous
streets
in
toledo
and
sat
in
churches
where
he
wrung
from
el
greco
the
secret
which
he
felt
the
mysterious
painter
held
for
him
athelny
entered
into
his
humour
and
on
sunday
afternoons
they
made
out
elaborate
itineraries
so
that
philip
should
miss
nothing
that
was
noteworthy
to
cheat
his
impatience
philip
began
to
teach
himself
spanish
and
in
the
deserted
sittingroom
in
harrington
street
he
spent
an
hour
every
evening
doing
spanish
exercises
and
puzzling
out
with
an
english
translation
by
his
side
the
magnificent
phrases
of
don
quixote
athelny
gave
him
a
lesson
once
a
week
and
philip
learned
a
few
sentences
to
help
him
on
his
journey
mrs
athelny
laughed
at
them
you
two
and
your
spanish
she
said
why
dont
you
do
something
useful
but
sally
who
was
growing
up
and
was
to
put
up
her
hair
at
christmas
stood
by
sometimes
and
listened
in
her
grave
way
while
her
father
and
philip
exchanged
remarks
in
a
language
she
did
not
understand
she
thought
her
father
the
most
wonderful
man
who
had
ever
existed
and
she
expressed
her
opinion
of
philip
only
through
her
fathers
commendations
father
thinks
a
rare
lot
of
your
uncle
philip
she
remarked
to
her
brothers
and
sisters
thorpe
the
eldest
boy
was
old
enough
to
go
on
the
arethusa
and
athelny
regaled
his
family
with
magnificent
descriptions
of
the
appearance
the
lad
would
make
when
he
came
back
in
uniform
for
his
holidays
as
soon
as
sally
was
seventeen
she
was
to
be
apprenticed
to
a
dressmaker
athelny
in
his
rhetorical
way
talked
of
the
birds
strong
enough
to
fly
now
who
were
leaving
the
parental
nest
and
with
tears
in
his
eyes
told
them
that
the
nest
would
be
there
still
if
ever
they
wished
to
return
to
it
a
shakedown
and
a
dinner
would
always
be
theirs
and
the
heart
of
a
father
would
never
be
closed
to
the
troubles
of
his
children
you
do
talk
athelny
said
his
wife
i
dont
know
what
trouble
theyre
likely
to
get
into
so
long
as
theyre
steady
so
long
as
youre
honest
and
not
afraid
of
work
youll
never
be
out
of
a
job
thats
what
i
think
and
i
can
tell
you
i
shant
be
sorry
when
i
see
the
last
of
them
earning
their
own
living
childbearing
hard
work
and
constant
anxiety
were
beginning
to
tell
on
mrs
athelny
and
sometimes
her
back
ached
in
the
evening
so
that
she
had
to
sit
down
and
rest
herself
her
ideal
of
happiness
was
to
have
a
girl
to
do
the
rough
work
so
that
she
need
not
herself
get
up
before
seven
athelny
waved
his
beautiful
white
hand
ah
my
betty
weve
deserved
well
of
the
state
you
and
i
weve
reared
nine
healthy
children
and
the
boys
shall
serve
their
king
the
girls
shall
cook
and
sew
and
in
their
turn
breed
healthy
children
he
turned
to
sally
and
to
comfort
her
for
the
anticlimax
of
the
contrast
added
grandiloquently
they
also
serve
who
only
stand
and
wait
athelny
had
lately
added
socialism
to
the
other
contradictory
theories
he
vehemently
believed
in
and
he
stated
now
in
a
socialist
state
we
should
be
richly
pensioned
you
and
i
betty
oh
dont
talk
to
me
about
your
socialists
ive
got
no
patience
with
them
she
cried
it
only
means
that
another
lot
of
lazy
loafers
will
make
a
good
thing
out
of
the
working
classes
my
motto
is
leave
me
alone
i
dont
want
anyone
interfering
with
me
ill
make
the
best
of
a
bad
job
and
the
devil
take
the
hindmost
dyou
call
life
a
bad
job
said
athelny
never
weve
had
our
ups
and
downs
weve
had
our
struggles
weve
always
been
poor
but
its
been
worth
it
ay
worth
it
a
hundred
times
i
say
when
i
look
round
at
my
children
you
do
talk
athelny
she
said
looking
at
him
not
with
anger
but
with
scornful
calm
youve
had
the
pleasant
part
of
the
children
ive
had
the
bearing
of
them
and
the
bearing
with
them
i
dont
say
that
im
not
fond
of
them
now
theyre
there
but
if
i
had
my
time
over
again
id
remain
single
why
if
id
remained
single
i
might
have
a
little
shop
by
now
and
four
or
five
hundred
pounds
in
the
bank
and
a
girl
to
do
the
rough
work
oh
i
wouldnt
go
over
my
life
again
not
for
something
philip
thought
of
the
countless
millions
to
whom
life
is
no
more
than
unending
labour
neither
beautiful
nor
ugly
but
just
to
be
accepted
in
the
same
spirit
as
one
accepts
the
changes
of
the
seasons
fury
seized
him
because
it
all
seemed
useless
he
could
not
reconcile
himself
to
the
belief
that
life
had
no
meaning
and
yet
everything
he
saw
all
his
thoughts
added
to
the
force
of
his
conviction
but
though
fury
seized
him
it
was
a
joyful
fury
life
was
not
so
horrible
if
it
was
meaningless
and
he
faced
it
with
a
strange
sense
of
power
chapter
cix
the
autumn
passed
into
winter
philip
had
left
his
address
with
mrs
foster
his
uncles
housekeeper
so
that
she
might
communicate
with
him
but
still
went
once
a
week
to
the
hospital
on
the
chance
of
there
being
a
letter
one
evening
he
saw
his
name
on
an
envelope
in
a
handwriting
he
had
hoped
never
to
see
again
it
gave
him
a
queer
feeling
for
a
little
while
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
take
it
it
brought
back
a
host
of
hateful
memories
but
at
length
impatient
with
himself
he
ripped
open
the
envelope
william
street
fitzroy
square
dear
phil
can
i
see
you
for
a
minute
or
two
as
soon
as
possible
i
am
in
awful
trouble
and
dont
know
what
to
do
its
not
money
yours
truly
mildred
he
tore
the
letter
into
little
bits
and
going
out
into
the
street
scattered
them
in
the
darkness
ill
see
her
damned
he
muttered
a
feeling
of
disgust
surged
up
in
him
at
the
thought
of
seeing
her
again
he
did
not
care
if
she
was
in
distress
it
served
her
right
whatever
it
was
he
thought
of
her
with
hatred
and
the
love
he
had
had
for
her
aroused
his
loathing
his
recollections
filled
him
with
nausea
and
as
he
walked
across
the
thames
he
drew
himself
aside
in
an
instinctive
withdrawal
from
his
thought
of
her
he
went
to
bed
but
he
could
not
sleep
he
wondered
what
was
the
matter
with
her
and
he
could
not
get
out
of
his
head
the
fear
that
she
was
ill
and
hungry
she
would
not
have
written
to
him
unless
she
were
desperate
he
was
angry
with
himself
for
his
weakness
but
he
knew
that
he
would
have
no
peace
unless
he
saw
her
next
morning
he
wrote
a
lettercard
and
posted
it
on
his
way
to
the
shop
he
made
it
as
stiff
as
he
could
and
said
merely
that
he
was
sorry
she
was
in
difficulties
and
would
come
to
the
address
she
had
given
at
seven
oclock
that
evening
it
was
that
of
a
shabby
lodginghouse
in
a
sordid
street
and
when
sick
at
the
thought
of
seeing
her
he
asked
whether
she
was
in
a
wild
hope
seized
him
that
she
had
left
it
looked
the
sort
of
place
people
moved
in
and
out
of
frequently
he
had
not
thought
of
looking
at
the
postmark
on
her
letter
and
did
not
know
how
many
days
it
had
lain
in
the
rack
the
woman
who
answered
the
bell
did
not
reply
to
his
inquiry
but
silently
preceded
him
along
the
passage
and
knocked
on
a
door
at
the
back
mrs
miller
a
gentleman
to
see
you
she
called
the
door
was
slightly
opened
and
mildred
looked
out
suspiciously
oh
its
you
she
said
come
in
he
walked
in
and
she
closed
the
door
it
was
a
very
small
bedroom
untidy
as
was
every
place
she
lived
in
there
was
a
pair
of
shoes
on
the
floor
lying
apart
from
one
another
and
uncleaned
a
hat
was
on
the
chest
of
drawers
with
false
curls
beside
it
and
there
was
a
blouse
on
the
table
philip
looked
for
somewhere
to
put
his
hat
the
hooks
behind
the
door
were
laden
with
skirts
and
he
noticed
that
they
were
muddy
at
the
hem
sit
down
wont
you
she
said
then
she
gave
a
little
awkward
laugh
i
suppose
you
were
surprised
to
hear
from
me
again
youre
awfully
hoarse
he
answered
have
you
got
a
sore
throat
yes
i
have
had
for
some
time
he
did
not
say
anything
he
waited
for
her
to
explain
why
she
wanted
to
see
him
the
look
of
the
room
told
him
clearly
enough
that
she
had
gone
back
to
the
life
from
which
he
had
taken
her
he
wondered
what
had
happened
to
the
baby
there
was
a
photograph
of
it
on
the
chimneypiece
but
no
sign
in
the
room
that
a
child
was
ever
there
mildred
was
holding
her
handkerchief
she
made
it
into
a
little
ball
and
passed
it
from
hand
to
hand
he
saw
that
she
was
very
nervous
she
was
staring
at
the
fire
and
he
could
look
at
her
without
meeting
her
eyes
she
was
much
thinner
than
when
she
had
left
him
and
the
skin
yellow
and
dryish
was
drawn
more
tightly
over
her
cheekbones
she
had
dyed
her
hair
and
it
was
now
flaxen
it
altered
her
a
good
deal
and
made
her
look
more
vulgar
i
was
relieved
to
get
your
letter
i
can
tell
you
she
said
at
last
i
thought
praps
you
werent
at
the
ospital
any
more
philip
did
not
speak
i
suppose
youre
qualified
by
now
arent
you
no
hows
that
im
no
longer
at
the
hospital
i
had
to
give
it
up
eighteen
months
ago
you
are
changeable
you
dont
seem
as
if
you
could
stick
to
anything
philip
was
silent
for
another
moment
and
when
he
went
on
it
was
with
coldness
i
lost
the
little
money
i
had
in
an
unlucky
speculation
and
i
couldnt
afford
to
go
on
with
the
medical
i
had
to
earn
my
living
as
best
i
could
what
are
you
doing
then
im
in
a
shop
oh
she
gave
him
a
quick
glance
and
turned
her
eyes
away
at
once
he
thought
that
she
reddened
she
dabbed
her
palms
nervously
with
the
handkerchief
youve
not
forgotten
all
your
doctoring
have
you
she
jerked
the
words
out
quite
oddly
not
entirely
because
thats
why
i
wanted
to
see
you
her
voice
sank
to
a
hoarse
whisper
i
dont
know
whats
the
matter
with
me
why
dont
you
go
to
a
hospital
i
dont
like
to
do
that
and
have
all
the
stoodents
staring
at
me
and
im
afraid
theyd
want
to
keep
me
what
are
you
complaining
of
asked
philip
coldly
with
the
stereotyped
phrase
used
in
the
outpatients
room
well
ive
come
out
in
a
rash
and
i
cant
get
rid
of
it
philip
felt
a
twinge
of
horror
in
his
heart
sweat
broke
out
on
his
forehead
let
me
look
at
your
throat
he
took
her
over
to
the
window
and
made
such
examination
as
he
could
suddenly
he
caught
sight
of
her
eyes
there
was
deadly
fear
in
them
it
was
horrible
to
see
she
was
terrified
she
wanted
him
to
reassure
her
she
looked
at
him
pleadingly
not
daring
to
ask
for
words
of
comfort
but
with
all
her
nerves
astrung
to
receive
them
he
had
none
to
offer
her
im
afraid
youre
very
ill
indeed
he
said
what
dyou
think
it
is
when
he
told
her
she
grew
deathly
pale
and
her
lips
even
turned
yellow
she
began
to
cry
hopelessly
quietly
at
first
and
then
with
choking
sobs
im
awfully
sorry
he
said
at
last
but
i
had
to
tell
you
i
may
just
as
well
kill
myself
and
have
done
with
it
he
took
no
notice
of
the
threat
have
you
got
any
money
he
asked
six
or
seven
pounds
you
must
give
up
this
life
you
know
dont
you
think
you
could
find
some
work
to
do
im
afraid
i
cant
help
you
much
i
only
get
twelve
bob
a
week
what
is
there
i
can
do
now
she
cried
impatiently
damn
it
all
you
must
try
to
get
something
he
spoke
to
her
very
gravely
telling
her
of
her
own
danger
and
the
danger
to
which
she
exposed
others
and
she
listened
sullenly
he
tried
to
console
her
at
last
he
brought
her
to
a
sulky
acquiescence
in
which
she
promised
to
do
all
he
advised
he
wrote
a
prescription
which
he
said
he
would
leave
at
the
nearest
chemists
and
he
impressed
upon
her
the
necessity
of
taking
her
medicine
with
the
utmost
regularity
getting
up
to
go
he
held
out
his
hand
dont
be
downhearted
youll
soon
get
over
your
throat
but
as
he
went
her
face
became
suddenly
distorted
and
she
caught
hold
of
his
coat
oh
dont
leave
me
she
cried
hoarsely
im
so
afraid
dont
leave
me
alone
yet
phil
please
theres
no
one
else
i
can
go
to
youre
the
only
friend
ive
ever
had
he
felt
the
terror
of
her
soul
and
it
was
strangely
like
that
terror
he
had
seen
in
his
uncles
eyes
when
he
feared
that
he
might
die
philip
looked
down
twice
that
woman
had
come
into
his
life
and
made
him
wretched
she
had
no
claim
upon
him
and
yet
he
knew
not
why
deep
in
his
heart
was
a
strange
aching
it
was
that
which
when
he
received
her
letter
had
left
him
no
peace
till
he
obeyed
her
summons
i
suppose
i
shall
never
really
quite
get
over
it
he
said
to
himself
what
perplexed
him
was
that
he
felt
a
curious
physical
distaste
which
made
it
uncomfortable
for
him
to
be
near
her
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
he
asked
lets
go
out
and
dine
together
ill
pay
he
hesitated
he
felt
that
she
was
creeping
back
again
into
his
life
when
he
thought
she
was
gone
out
of
it
for
ever
she
watched
him
with
sickening
anxiety
oh
i
know
ive
treated
you
shocking
but
dont
leave
me
alone
now
youve
had
your
revenge
if
you
leave
me
by
myself
now
i
dont
know
what
i
shall
do
all
right
i
dont
mind
he
said
but
we
shall
have
to
do
it
on
the
cheap
i
havent
got
money
to
throw
away
these
days
she
sat
down
and
put
her
shoes
on
then
changed
her
skirt
and
put
on
a
hat
and
they
walked
out
together
till
they
found
a
restaurant
in
the
tottenham
court
road
philip
had
got
out
of
the
habit
of
eating
at
those
hours
and
mildreds
throat
was
so
sore
that
she
could
not
swallow
they
had
a
little
cold
ham
and
philip
drank
a
glass
of
beer
they
sat
opposite
one
another
as
they
had
so
often
sat
before
he
wondered
if
she
remembered
they
had
nothing
to
say
to
one
another
and
would
have
sat
in
silence
if
philip
had
not
forced
himself
to
talk
in
the
bright
light
of
the
restaurant
with
its
vulgar
lookingglasses
that
reflected
in
an
endless
series
she
looked
old
and
haggard
philip
was
anxious
to
know
about
the
child
but
he
had
not
the
courage
to
ask
at
last
she
said
you
know
baby
died
last
summer
oh
he
said
you
might
say
youre
sorry
im
not
he
answered
im
very
glad
she
glanced
at
him
and
understanding
what
he
meant
looked
away
you
were
rare
stuck
on
it
at
one
time
werent
you
i
always
thought
it
funny
like
how
you
could
see
so
much
in
another
mans
child
when
they
had
finished
eating
they
called
at
the
chemists
for
the
medicine
philip
had
ordered
and
going
back
to
the
shabby
room
he
made
her
take
a
dose
then
they
sat
together
till
it
was
time
for
philip
to
go
back
to
harrington
street
he
was
hideously
bored
philip
went
to
see
her
every
day
she
took
the
medicine
he
had
prescribed
and
followed
his
directions
and
soon
the
results
were
so
apparent
that
she
gained
the
greatest
confidence
in
philips
skill
as
she
grew
better
she
grew
less
despondent
she
talked
more
freely
as
soon
as
i
can
get
a
job
i
shall
be
all
right
she
said
ive
had
my
lesson
now
and
i
mean
to
profit
by
it
no
more
racketing
about
for
yours
truly
each
time
he
saw
her
philip
asked
whether
she
had
found
work
she
told
him
not
to
worry
she
would
find
something
to
do
as
soon
as
she
wanted
it
she
had
several
strings
to
her
bow
it
was
all
the
better
not
to
do
anything
for
a
week
or
two
he
could
not
deny
this
but
at
the
end
of
that
time
he
became
more
insistent
she
laughed
at
him
she
was
much
more
cheerful
now
and
said
he
was
a
fussy
old
thing
she
told
him
long
stories
of
the
manageresses
she
interviewed
for
her
idea
was
to
get
work
at
some
eatinghouse
what
they
said
and
what
she
answered
nothing
definite
was
fixed
but
she
was
sure
to
settle
something
at
the
beginning
of
the
following
week
there
was
no
use
hurrying
and
it
would
be
a
mistake
to
take
something
unsuitable
its
absurd
to
talk
like
that
he
said
impatiently
you
must
take
anything
you
can
get
i
cant
help
you
and
your
money
wont
last
for
ever
oh
well
ive
not
come
to
the
end
of
it
yet
and
chance
it
he
looked
at
her
sharply
it
was
three
weeks
since
his
first
visit
and
she
had
then
less
than
seven
pounds
suspicion
seized
him
he
remembered
some
of
the
things
she
had
said
he
put
two
and
two
together
he
wondered
whether
she
had
made
any
attempt
to
find
work
perhaps
she
had
been
lying
to
him
all
the
time
it
was
very
strange
that
her
money
should
have
lasted
so
long
what
is
your
rent
here
oh
the
landladys
very
nice
different
from
what
some
of
them
are
shes
quite
willing
to
wait
till
its
convenient
for
me
to
pay
he
was
silent
what
he
suspected
was
so
horrible
that
he
hesitated
it
was
no
use
to
ask
her
she
would
deny
everything
if
he
wanted
to
know
he
must
find
out
for
himself
he
was
in
the
habit
of
leaving
her
every
evening
at
eight
and
when
the
clock
struck
he
got
up
but
instead
of
going
back
to
harrington
street
he
stationed
himself
at
the
corner
of
fitzroy
square
so
that
he
could
see
anyone
who
came
along
william
street
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
waited
an
interminable
time
and
he
was
on
the
point
of
going
away
thinking
his
surmise
had
been
mistaken
when
the
door
of
no

opened
and
mildred
came
out
he
fell
back
into
the
darkness
and
watched
her
walk
towards
him
she
had
on
the
hat
with
a
quantity
of
feathers
on
it
which
he
had
seen
in
her
room
and
she
wore
a
dress
he
recognized
too
showy
for
the
street
and
unsuitable
to
the
time
of
year
he
followed
her
slowly
till
she
came
into
the
tottenham
court
road
where
she
slackened
her
pace
at
the
corner
of
oxford
street
she
stopped
looked
round
and
crossed
over
to
a
musichall
he
went
up
to
her
and
touched
her
on
the
arm
he
saw
that
she
had
rouged
her
cheeks
and
painted
her
lips
where
are
you
going
mildred
she
started
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
and
reddened
as
she
always
did
when
she
was
caught
in
a
lie
then
the
flash
of
anger
which
he
knew
so
well
came
into
her
eyes
as
she
instinctively
sought
to
defend
herself
by
abuse
but
she
did
not
say
the
words
which
were
on
the
tip
of
her
tongue
oh
i
was
only
going
to
see
the
show
it
gives
me
the
hump
sitting
every
night
by
myself
he
did
not
pretend
to
believe
her
you
mustnt
good
heavens
ive
told
you
fifty
times
how
dangerous
it
is
you
must
stop
this
sort
of
thing
at
once
oh
hold
your
jaw
she
cried
roughly
how
dyou
suppose
im
going
to
live
he
took
hold
of
her
arm
and
without
thinking
what
he
was
doing
tried
to
drag
her
away
for
gods
sake
come
along
let
me
take
you
home
you
dont
know
what
youre
doing
its
criminal
what
do
i
care
let
them
take
their
chance
men
havent
been
so
good
to
me
that
i
need
bother
my
head
about
them
she
pushed
him
away
and
walking
up
to
the
boxoffice
put
down
her
money
philip
had
threepence
in
his
pocket
he
could
not
follow
he
turned
away
and
walked
slowly
down
oxford
street
i
cant
do
anything
more
he
said
to
himself
that
was
the
end
he
did
not
see
her
again
chapter
cx
christmas
that
year
falling
on
thursday
the
shop
was
to
close
for
four
days
philip
wrote
to
his
uncle
asking
whether
it
would
be
convenient
for
him
to
spend
the
holidays
at
the
vicarage
he
received
an
answer
from
mrs
foster
saying
that
mr
carey
was
not
well
enough
to
write
himself
but
wished
to
see
his
nephew
and
would
be
glad
if
he
came
down
she
met
philip
at
the
door
and
when
she
shook
hands
with
him
said
youll
find
him
changed
since
you
was
here
last
sir
but
youll
pretend
you
dont
notice
anything
wont
you
sir
hes
that
nervous
about
himself
philip
nodded
and
she
led
him
into
the
diningroom
heres
mr
philip
sir
the
vicar
of
blackstable
was
a
dying
man
there
was
no
mistaking
that
when
you
looked
at
the
hollow
cheeks
and
the
shrunken
body
he
sat
huddled
in
the
armchair
with
his
head
strangely
thrown
back
and
a
shawl
over
his
shoulders
he
could
not
walk
now
without
the
help
of
sticks
and
his
hands
trembled
so
that
he
could
only
feed
himself
with
difficulty
he
cant
last
long
now
thought
philip
as
he
looked
at
him
how
dyou
think
im
looking
asked
the
vicar
dyou
think
ive
changed
since
you
were
here
last
i
think
you
look
stronger
than
you
did
last
summer
it
was
the
heat
that
always
upsets
me
mr
careys
history
of
the
last
few
months
consisted
in
the
number
of
weeks
he
had
spent
in
his
bedroom
and
the
number
of
weeks
he
had
spent
downstairs
he
had
a
handbell
by
his
side
and
while
he
talked
he
rang
it
for
mrs
foster
who
sat
in
the
next
room
ready
to
attend
to
his
wants
to
ask
on
what
day
of
the
month
he
had
first
left
his
room
on
the
seventh
of
november
sir
mr
carey
looked
at
philip
to
see
how
he
took
the
information
but
i
eat
well
still
dont
i
mrs
foster
yes
sir
youve
got
a
wonderful
appetite
i
dont
seem
to
put
on
flesh
though
nothing
interested
him
now
but
his
health
he
was
set
upon
one
thing
indomitably
and
that
was
living
just
living
notwithstanding
the
monotony
of
his
life
and
the
constant
pain
which
allowed
him
to
sleep
only
when
he
was
under
the
influence
of
morphia
its
terrible
the
amount
of
money
i
have
to
spend
on
doctors
bills
he
tinkled
his
bell
again
mrs
foster
show
master
philip
the
chemists
bill
patiently
she
took
it
off
the
chimneypiece
and
handed
it
to
philip
thats
only
one
month
i
was
wondering
if
as
youre
doctoring
yourself
you
couldnt
get
me
the
drugs
cheaper
i
thought
of
getting
them
down
from
the
stores
but
then
theres
the
postage
though
apparently
taking
so
little
interest
in
him
that
he
did
not
trouble
to
inquire
what
phil
was
doing
he
seemed
glad
to
have
him
there
he
asked
how
long
he
could
stay
and
when
philip
told
him
he
must
leave
on
tuesday
morning
expressed
a
wish
that
the
visit
might
have
been
longer
he
told
him
minutely
all
his
symptoms
and
repeated
what
the
doctor
had
said
of
him
he
broke
off
to
ring
his
bell
and
when
mrs
foster
came
in
said
oh
i
wasnt
sure
if
you
were
there
i
only
rang
to
see
if
you
were
when
she
had
gone
he
explained
to
philip
that
it
made
him
uneasy
if
he
was
not
certain
that
mrs
foster
was
within
earshot
she
knew
exactly
what
to
do
with
him
if
anything
happened
philip
seeing
that
she
was
tired
and
that
her
eyes
were
heavy
from
want
of
sleep
suggested
that
he
was
working
her
too
hard
oh
nonsense
said
the
vicar
shes
as
strong
as
a
horse
and
when
next
she
came
in
to
give
him
his
medicine
he
said
to
her
master
philip
says
youve
got
too
much
to
do
mrs
foster
you
like
looking
after
me
dont
you
oh
i
dont
mind
sir
i
want
to
do
everything
i
can
presently
the
medicine
took
effect
and
mr
carey
fell
asleep
philip
went
into
the
kitchen
and
asked
mrs
foster
whether
she
could
stand
the
work
he
saw
that
for
some
months
she
had
had
little
peace
well
sir
what
can
i
do
she
answered
the
poor
old
gentlemans
so
dependent
on
me
and
although
he
is
troublesome
sometimes
you
cant
help
liking
him
can
you
ive
been
here
so
many
years
now
i
dont
know
what
i
shall
do
when
he
comes
to
go
philip
saw
that
she
was
really
fond
of
the
old
man
she
washed
and
dressed
him
gave
him
his
food
and
was
up
half
a
dozen
times
in
the
night
for
she
slept
in
the
next
room
to
his
and
whenever
he
awoke
he
tinkled
his
little
bell
till
she
came
in
he
might
die
at
any
moment
but
he
might
live
for
months
it
was
wonderful
that
she
should
look
after
a
stranger
with
such
patient
tenderness
and
it
was
tragic
and
pitiful
that
she
should
be
alone
in
the
world
to
care
for
him
it
seemed
to
philip
that
the
religion
which
his
uncle
had
preached
all
his
life
was
now
of
no
more
than
formal
importance
to
him
every
sunday
the
curate
came
and
administered
to
him
holy
communion
and
he
often
read
his
bible
but
it
was
clear
that
he
looked
upon
death
with
horror
he
believed
that
it
was
the
gateway
to
life
everlasting
but
he
did
not
want
to
enter
upon
that
life
in
constant
pain
chained
to
his
chair
and
having
given
up
the
hope
of
ever
getting
out
into
the
open
again
like
a
child
in
the
hands
of
a
woman
to
whom
he
paid
wages
he
clung
to
the
world
he
knew
in
philips
head
was
a
question
he
could
not
ask
because
he
was
aware
that
his
uncle
would
never
give
any
but
a
conventional
answer
he
wondered
whether
at
the
very
end
now
that
the
machine
was
painfully
wearing
itself
out
the
clergyman
still
believed
in
immortality
perhaps
at
the
bottom
of
his
soul
not
allowed
to
shape
itself
into
words
in
case
it
became
urgent
was
the
conviction
that
there
was
no
god
and
after
this
life
nothing
on
the
evening
of
boxing
day
philip
sat
in
the
diningroom
with
his
uncle
he
had
to
start
very
early
next
morning
in
order
to
get
to
the
shop
by
nine
and
he
was
to
say
goodnight
to
mr
carey
then
the
vicar
of
blackstable
was
dozing
and
philip
lying
on
the
sofa
by
the
window
let
his
book
fall
on
his
knees
and
looked
idly
round
the
room
he
asked
himself
how
much
the
furniture
would
fetch
he
had
walked
round
the
house
and
looked
at
the
things
he
had
known
from
his
childhood
there
were
a
few
pieces
of
china
which
might
go
for
a
decent
price
and
philip
wondered
if
it
would
be
worth
while
to
take
them
up
to
london
but
the
furniture
was
of
the
victorian
order
of
mahogany
solid
and
ugly
it
would
go
for
nothing
at
an
auction
there
were
three
or
four
thousand
books
but
everyone
knew
how
badly
they
sold
and
it
was
not
probable
that
they
would
fetch
more
than
a
hundred
pounds
philip
did
not
know
how
much
his
uncle
would
leave
and
he
reckoned
out
for
the
hundredth
time
what
was
the
least
sum
upon
which
he
could
finish
the
curriculum
at
the
hospital
take
his
degree
and
live
during
the
time
he
wished
to
spend
on
hospital
appointments
he
looked
at
the
old
man
sleeping
restlessly
there
was
no
humanity
left
in
that
shrivelled
face
it
was
the
face
of
some
queer
animal
philip
thought
how
easy
it
would
be
to
finish
that
useless
life
he
had
thought
it
each
evening
when
mrs
foster
prepared
for
his
uncle
the
medicine
which
was
to
give
him
an
easy
night
there
were
two
bottles
one
contained
a
drug
which
he
took
regularly
and
the
other
an
opiate
if
the
pain
grew
unendurable
this
was
poured
out
for
him
and
left
by
his
bedside
he
generally
took
it
at
three
or
four
in
the
morning
it
would
be
a
simple
thing
to
double
the
dose
he
would
die
in
the
night
and
no
one
would
suspect
anything
for
that
was
how
doctor
wigram
expected
him
to
die
the
end
would
be
painless
philip
clenched
his
hands
as
he
thought
of
the
money
he
wanted
so
badly
a
few
more
months
of
that
wretched
life
could
matter
nothing
to
the
old
man
but
the
few
more
months
meant
everything
to
him
he
was
getting
to
the
end
of
his
endurance
and
when
he
thought
of
going
back
to
work
in
the
morning
he
shuddered
with
horror
his
heart
beat
quickly
at
the
thought
which
obsessed
him
and
though
he
made
an
effort
to
put
it
out
of
his
mind
he
could
not
it
would
be
so
easy
so
desperately
easy
he
had
no
feeling
for
the
old
man
he
had
never
liked
him
he
had
been
selfish
all
his
life
selfish
to
his
wife
who
adored
him
indifferent
to
the
boy
who
had
been
put
in
his
charge
he
was
not
a
cruel
man
but
a
stupid
hard
man
eaten
up
with
a
small
sensuality
it
would
be
easy
desperately
easy
philip
did
not
dare
he
was
afraid
of
remorse
it
would
be
no
good
having
the
money
if
he
regretted
all
his
life
what
he
had
done
though
he
had
told
himself
so
often
that
regret
was
futile
there
were
certain
things
that
came
back
to
him
occasionally
and
worried
him
he
wished
they
were
not
on
his
conscience
his
uncle
opened
his
eyes
philip
was
glad
for
he
looked
a
little
more
human
then
he
was
frankly
horrified
at
the
idea
that
had
come
to
him
it
was
murder
that
he
was
meditating
and
he
wondered
if
other
people
had
such
thoughts
or
whether
he
was
abnormal
and
depraved
he
supposed
he
could
not
have
done
it
when
it
came
to
the
point
but
there
the
thought
was
constantly
recurring
if
he
held
his
hand
it
was
from
fear
his
uncle
spoke
youre
not
looking
forward
to
my
death
philip
philip
felt
his
heart
beat
against
his
chest
good
heavens
no
thats
a
good
boy
i
shouldnt
like
you
to
do
that
youll
get
a
little
bit
of
money
when
i
pass
away
but
you
mustnt
look
forward
to
it
it
wouldnt
profit
you
if
you
did
he
spoke
in
a
low
voice
and
there
was
a
curious
anxiety
in
his
tone
it
sent
a
pang
into
philips
heart
he
wondered
what
strange
insight
might
have
led
the
old
man
to
surmise
what
strange
desires
were
in
philips
mind
i
hope
youll
live
for
another
twenty
years
he
said
oh
well
i
cant
expect
to
do
that
but
if
i
take
care
of
myself
i
dont
see
why
i
shouldnt
last
another
three
or
four
he
was
silent
for
a
while
and
philip
found
nothing
to
say
then
as
if
he
had
been
thinking
it
all
over
the
old
man
spoke
again
everyone
has
the
right
to
live
as
long
as
he
can
philip
wanted
to
distract
his
mind
by
the
way
i
suppose
you
never
hear
from
miss
wilkinson
now
yes
i
had
a
letter
some
time
this
year
shes
married
you
know
really
yes
she
married
a
widower
i
believe
theyre
quite
comfortable
chapter
cxi
next
day
philip
began
work
again
but
the
end
which
he
expected
within
a
few
weeks
did
not
come
the
weeks
passed
into
months
the
winter
wore
away
and
in
the
parks
the
trees
burst
into
bud
and
into
leaf
a
terrible
lassitude
settled
upon
philip
time
was
passing
though
it
went
with
such
heavy
feet
and
he
thought
that
his
youth
was
going
and
soon
he
would
have
lost
it
and
nothing
would
have
been
accomplished
his
work
seemed
more
aimless
now
that
there
was
the
certainty
of
his
leaving
it
he
became
skilful
in
the
designing
of
costumes
and
though
he
had
no
inventive
faculty
acquired
quickness
in
the
adaptation
of
french
fashions
to
the
english
market
sometimes
he
was
not
displeased
with
his
drawings
but
they
always
bungled
them
in
the
execution
he
was
amused
to
notice
that
he
suffered
from
a
lively
irritation
when
his
ideas
were
not
adequately
carried
out
he
had
to
walk
warily
whenever
he
suggested
something
original
mr
sampson
turned
it
down
their
customers
did
not
want
anything
outre
it
was
a
very
respectable
class
of
business
and
when
you
had
a
connection
of
that
sort
it
wasnt
worth
while
taking
liberties
with
it
once
or
twice
he
spoke
sharply
to
philip
he
thought
the
young
man
was
getting
a
bit
above
himself
because
philips
ideas
did
not
always
coincide
with
his
own
you
jolly
well
take
care
my
fine
young
fellow
or
one
of
these
days
youll
find
yourself
in
the
street
philip
longed
to
give
him
a
punch
on
the
nose
but
he
restrained
himself
after
all
it
could
not
possibly
last
much
longer
and
then
he
would
he
done
with
all
these
people
for
ever
sometimes
in
comic
desperation
he
cried
out
that
his
uncle
must
be
made
of
iron
what
a
constitution
the
ills
he
suffered
from
would
have
killed
any
decent
person
twelve
months
before
when
at
last
the
news
came
that
the
vicar
was
dying
philip
who
had
been
thinking
of
other
things
was
taken
by
surprise
it
was
in
july
and
in
another
fortnight
he
was
to
have
gone
for
his
holiday
he
received
a
letter
from
mrs
foster
to
say
the
doctor
did
not
give
mr
carey
many
days
to
live
and
if
philip
wished
to
see
him
again
he
must
come
at
once
philip
went
to
the
buyer
and
told
him
he
wanted
to
leave
mr
sampson
was
a
decent
fellow
and
when
he
knew
the
circumstances
made
no
difficulties
philip
said
goodbye
to
the
people
in
his
department
the
reason
of
his
leaving
had
spread
among
them
in
an
exaggerated
form
and
they
thought
he
had
come
into
a
fortune
mrs
hodges
had
tears
in
her
eyes
when
she
shook
hands
with
him
i
suppose
we
shant
often
see
you
again
she
said
im
glad
to
get
away
from
lynns
he
answered
it
was
strange
but
he
was
actually
sorry
to
leave
these
people
whom
he
thought
he
had
loathed
and
when
he
drove
away
from
the
house
in
harrington
street
it
was
with
no
exultation
he
had
so
anticipated
the
emotions
he
would
experience
on
this
occasion
that
now
he
felt
nothing
he
was
as
unconcerned
as
though
he
were
going
for
a
few
days
holiday
ive
got
a
rotten
nature
he
said
to
himself
i
look
forward
to
things
awfully
and
then
when
they
come
im
always
disappointed
he
reached
blackstable
early
in
the
afternoon
mrs
foster
met
him
at
the
door
and
her
face
told
him
that
his
uncle
was
not
yet
dead
hes
a
little
better
today
she
said
hes
got
a
wonderful
constitution
she
led
him
into
the
bedroom
where
mr
carey
lay
on
his
back
he
gave
philip
a
slight
smile
in
which
was
a
trace
of
satisfied
cunning
at
having
circumvented
his
enemy
once
more
i
thought
it
was
all
up
with
me
yesterday
he
said
in
an
exhausted
voice
theyd
all
given
me
up
hadnt
you
mrs
foster
youve
got
a
wonderful
constitution
theres
no
denying
that
theres
life
in
the
old
dog
yet
mrs
foster
said
that
the
vicar
must
not
talk
it
would
tire
him
she
treated
him
like
a
child
with
kindly
despotism
and
there
was
something
childish
in
the
old
mans
satisfaction
at
having
cheated
all
their
expectations
it
struck
him
at
once
that
philip
had
been
sent
for
and
he
was
amused
that
he
had
been
brought
on
a
fools
errand
if
he
could
only
avoid
another
of
his
heart
attacks
he
would
get
well
enough
in
a
week
or
two
and
he
had
had
the
attacks
several
times
before
he
always
felt
as
if
he
were
going
to
die
but
he
never
did
they
all
talked
of
his
constitution
but
they
none
of
them
knew
how
strong
it
was
are
you
going
to
stay
a
day
or
two
he
asked
philip
pretending
to
believe
he
had
come
down
for
a
holiday
i
was
thinking
of
it
philip
answered
cheerfully
a
breath
of
seaair
will
do
you
good
presently
dr
wigram
came
and
after
he
had
seen
the
vicar
talked
with
philip
he
adopted
an
appropriate
manner
im
afraid
it
is
the
end
this
time
philip
he
said
itll
be
a
great
loss
to
all
of
us
ive
known
him
for
fiveandthirty
years
he
seems
well
enough
now
said
philip
im
keeping
him
alive
on
drugs
but
it
cant
last
it
was
dreadful
these
last
two
days
i
thought
he
was
dead
half
a
dozen
times
the
doctor
was
silent
for
a
minute
or
two
but
at
the
gate
he
said
suddenly
to
philip
has
mrs
foster
said
anything
to
you
what
dyou
mean
theyre
very
superstitious
these
people
shes
got
hold
of
an
idea
that
hes
got
something
on
his
mind
and
he
cant
die
till
he
gets
rid
of
it
and
he
cant
bring
himself
to
confess
it
philip
did
not
answer
and
the
doctor
went
on
of
course
its
nonsense
hes
led
a
very
good
life
hes
done
his
duty
hes
been
a
good
parish
priest
and
im
sure
we
shall
all
miss
him
he
cant
have
anything
to
reproach
himself
with
i
very
much
doubt
whether
the
next
vicar
will
suit
us
half
so
well
for
several
days
mr
carey
continued
without
change
his
appetite
which
had
been
excellent
left
him
and
he
could
eat
little
dr
wigram
did
not
hesitate
now
to
still
the
pain
of
the
neuritis
which
tormented
him
and
that
with
the
constant
shaking
of
his
palsied
limbs
was
gradually
exhausting
him
his
mind
remained
clear
philip
and
mrs
foster
nursed
him
between
them
she
was
so
tired
by
the
many
months
during
which
she
had
been
attentive
to
all
his
wants
that
philip
insisted
on
sitting
up
with
the
patient
so
that
she
might
have
her
nights
rest
he
passed
the
long
hours
in
an
armchair
so
that
he
should
not
sleep
soundly
and
read
by
the
light
of
shaded
candles
the
thousand
and
one
nights
he
had
not
read
them
since
he
was
a
little
boy
and
they
brought
back
his
childhood
to
him
sometimes
he
sat
and
listened
to
the
silence
of
the
night
when
the
effects
of
the
opiate
wore
off
mr
carey
grew
restless
and
kept
him
constantly
busy
at
last
early
one
morning
when
the
birds
were
chattering
noisily
in
the
trees
he
heard
his
name
called
he
went
up
to
the
bed
mr
carey
was
lying
on
his
back
with
his
eyes
looking
at
the
ceiling
he
did
not
turn
them
on
philip
philip
saw
that
sweat
was
on
his
forehead
and
he
took
a
towel
and
wiped
it
is
that
you
philip
the
old
man
asked
philip
was
startled
because
the
voice
was
suddenly
changed
it
was
hoarse
and
low
so
would
a
man
speak
if
he
was
cold
with
fear
yes
dyou
want
anything
there
was
a
pause
and
still
the
unseeing
eyes
stared
at
the
ceiling
then
a
twitch
passed
over
the
face
i
think
im
going
to
die
he
said
oh
what
nonsense
cried
philip
youre
not
going
to
die
for
years
two
tears
were
wrung
from
the
old
mans
eyes
they
moved
philip
horribly
his
uncle
had
never
betrayed
any
particular
emotion
in
the
affairs
of
life
and
it
was
dreadful
to
see
them
now
for
they
signified
a
terror
that
was
unspeakable
send
for
mr
simmonds
he
said
i
want
to
take
the
communion
mr
simmonds
was
the
curate
now
asked
philip
soon
or
else
itll
be
too
late
philip
went
to
awake
mrs
foster
but
it
was
later
than
he
thought
and
she
was
up
already
he
told
her
to
send
the
gardener
with
a
message
and
he
went
back
to
his
uncles
room
have
you
sent
for
mr
simmonds
yes
there
was
a
silence
philip
sat
by
the
bedside
and
occasionally
wiped
the
sweating
forehead
let
me
hold
your
hand
philip
the
old
man
said
at
last
philip
gave
him
his
hand
and
he
clung
to
it
as
to
life
for
comfort
in
his
extremity
perhaps
he
had
never
really
loved
anyone
in
all
his
days
but
now
he
turned
instinctively
to
a
human
being
his
hand
was
wet
and
cold
it
grasped
philips
with
feeble
despairing
energy
the
old
man
was
fighting
with
the
fear
of
death
and
philip
thought
that
all
must
go
through
that
oh
how
monstrous
it
was
and
they
could
believe
in
a
god
that
allowed
his
creatures
to
suffer
such
a
cruel
torture
he
had
never
cared
for
his
uncle
and
for
two
years
he
had
longed
every
day
for
his
death
but
now
he
could
not
overcome
the
compassion
that
filled
his
heart
what
a
price
it
was
to
pay
for
being
other
than
the
beasts
they
remained
in
silence
broken
only
once
by
a
low
inquiry
from
mr
carey
hasnt
he
come
yet
at
last
the
housekeeper
came
in
softly
to
say
that
mr
simmonds
was
there
he
carried
a
bag
in
which
were
his
surplice
and
his
hood
mrs
foster
brought
the
communion
plate
mr
simmonds
shook
hands
silently
with
philip
and
then
with
professional
gravity
went
to
the
sick
mans
side
philip
and
the
maid
went
out
of
the
room
philip
walked
round
the
garden
all
fresh
and
dewy
in
the
morning
the
birds
were
singing
gaily
the
sky
was
blue
but
the
air
saltladen
was
sweet
and
cool
the
roses
were
in
full
bloom
the
green
of
the
trees
the
green
of
the
lawns
was
eager
and
brilliant
philip
walked
and
as
he
walked
he
thought
of
the
mystery
which
was
proceeding
in
that
bedroom
it
gave
him
a
peculiar
emotion
presently
mrs
foster
came
out
to
him
and
said
that
his
uncle
wished
to
see
him
the
curate
was
putting
his
things
back
into
the
black
bag
the
sick
man
turned
his
head
a
little
and
greeted
him
with
a
smile
philip
was
astonished
for
there
was
a
change
in
him
an
extraordinary
change
his
eyes
had
no
longer
the
terrorstricken
look
and
the
pinching
of
his
face
had
gone
he
looked
happy
and
serene
im
quite
prepared
now
he
said
and
his
voice
had
a
different
tone
in
it
when
the
lord
sees
fit
to
call
me
i
am
ready
to
give
my
soul
into
his
hands
philip
did
not
speak
he
could
see
that
his
uncle
was
sincere
it
was
almost
a
miracle
he
had
taken
the
body
and
blood
of
his
savior
and
they
had
given
him
strength
so
that
he
no
longer
feared
the
inevitable
passage
into
the
night
he
knew
he
was
going
to
die
he
was
resigned
he
only
said
one
thing
more
i
shall
rejoin
my
dear
wife
it
startled
philip
he
remembered
with
what
a
callous
selfishness
his
uncle
had
treated
her
how
obtuse
he
had
been
to
her
humble
devoted
love
the
curate
deeply
moved
went
away
and
mrs
foster
weeping
accompanied
him
to
the
door
mr
carey
exhausted
by
his
effort
fell
into
a
light
doze
and
philip
sat
down
by
the
bed
and
waited
for
the
end
the
morning
wore
on
and
the
old
mans
breathing
grew
stertorous
the
doctor
came
and
said
he
was
dying
he
was
unconscious
and
he
pecked
feebly
at
the
sheets
he
was
restless
and
he
cried
out
dr
wigram
gave
him
a
hypodermic
injection
it
cant
do
any
good
now
he
may
die
at
any
moment
the
doctor
looked
at
his
watch
and
then
at
the
patient
philip
saw
that
it
was
one
oclock
dr
wigram
was
thinking
of
his
dinner
its
no
use
your
waiting
he
said
theres
nothing
i
can
do
said
the
doctor
when
he
was
gone
mrs
foster
asked
philip
if
he
would
go
to
the
carpenter
who
was
also
the
undertaker
and
tell
him
to
send
up
a
woman
to
lay
out
the
body
you
want
a
little
fresh
air
she
said
itll
do
you
good
the
undertaker
lived
half
a
mile
away
when
philip
gave
him
his
message
he
said
when
did
the
poor
old
gentleman
die
philip
hesitated
it
occurred
to
him
that
it
would
seem
brutal
to
fetch
a
woman
to
wash
the
body
while
his
uncle
still
lived
and
he
wondered
why
mrs
foster
had
asked
him
to
come
they
would
think
he
was
in
a
great
hurry
to
kill
the
old
man
off
he
thought
the
undertaker
looked
at
him
oddly
he
repeated
the
question
it
irritated
philip
it
was
no
business
of
his
when
did
the
vicar
pass
away
philips
first
impulse
was
to
say
that
it
had
just
happened
but
then
it
would
seem
inexplicable
if
the
sick
man
lingered
for
several
hours
he
reddened
and
answered
awkwardly
oh
he
isnt
exactly
dead
yet
the
undertaker
looked
at
him
in
perplexity
and
he
hurried
to
explain
mrs
foster
is
all
alone
and
she
wants
a
woman
there
you
understood
dont
you
he
may
be
dead
by
now
the
undertaker
nodded
oh
yes
i
see
ill
send
someone
up
at
once
when
philip
got
back
to
the
vicarage
he
went
up
to
the
bedroom
mrs
foster
rose
from
her
chair
by
the
bedside
hes
just
as
he
was
when
you
left
she
said
she
went
down
to
get
herself
something
to
eat
and
philip
watched
curiously
the
process
of
death
there
was
nothing
human
now
in
the
unconscious
being
that
struggled
feebly
sometimes
a
muttered
ejaculation
issued
from
the
loose
mouth
the
sun
beat
down
hotly
from
a
cloudless
sky
but
the
trees
in
the
garden
were
pleasant
and
cool
it
was
a
lovely
day
a
bluebottle
buzzed
against
the
windowpane
suddenly
there
was
a
loud
rattle
it
made
philip
start
it
was
horribly
frightening
a
movement
passed
through
the
limbs
and
the
old
man
was
dead
the
machine
had
run
down
the
bluebottle
buzzed
buzzed
noisily
against
the
windowpane
chapter
cxii
josiah
graves
in
his
masterful
way
made
arrangements
becoming
but
economical
for
the
funeral
and
when
it
was
over
came
back
to
the
vicarage
with
philip
the
will
was
in
his
charge
and
with
a
due
sense
of
the
fitness
of
things
he
read
it
to
philip
over
an
early
cup
of
tea
it
was
written
on
half
a
sheet
of
paper
and
left
everything
mr
carey
had
to
his
nephew
there
was
the
furniture
about
eighty
pounds
at
the
bank
twenty
shares
in
the
a
b
c
company
a
few
in
allsops
brewery
some
in
the
oxford
musichall
and
a
few
more
in
a
london
restaurant
they
had
been
bought
under
mr
graves
direction
and
he
told
philip
with
satisfaction
you
see
people
must
eat
they
will
drink
and
they
want
amusement
youre
always
safe
if
you
put
your
money
in
what
the
public
thinks
necessities
his
words
showed
a
nice
discrimination
between
the
grossness
of
the
vulgar
which
he
deplored
but
accepted
and
the
finer
taste
of
the
elect
altogether
in
investments
there
was
about
five
hundred
pounds
and
to
that
must
be
added
the
balance
at
the
bank
and
what
the
furniture
would
fetch
it
was
riches
to
philip
he
was
not
happy
but
infinitely
relieved
mr
graves
left
him
after
they
had
discussed
the
auction
which
must
be
held
as
soon
as
possible
and
philip
sat
himself
down
to
go
through
the
papers
of
the
deceased
the
rev
william
carey
had
prided
himself
on
never
destroying
anything
and
there
were
piles
of
correspondence
dating
back
for
fifty
years
and
bundles
upon
bundles
of
neatly
docketed
bills
he
had
kept
not
only
letters
addressed
to
him
but
letters
which
himself
had
written
there
was
a
yellow
packet
of
letters
which
he
had
written
to
his
father
in
the
forties
when
as
an
oxford
undergraduate
he
had
gone
to
germany
for
the
long
vacation
philip
read
them
idly
it
was
a
different
william
carey
from
the
william
carey
he
had
known
and
yet
there
were
traces
in
the
boy
which
might
to
an
acute
observer
have
suggested
the
man
the
letters
were
formal
and
a
little
stilted
he
showed
himself
strenuous
to
see
all
that
was
noteworthy
and
he
described
with
a
fine
enthusiasm
the
castles
of
the
rhine
the
falls
of
schaffhausen
made
him
offer
reverent
thanks
to
the
allpowerful
creator
of
the
universe
whose
works
were
wondrous
and
beautiful
and
he
could
not
help
thinking
that
they
who
lived
in
sight
of
this
handiwork
of
their
blessed
maker
must
be
moved
by
the
contemplation
to
lead
pure
and
holy
lives
among
some
bills
philip
found
a
miniature
which
had
been
painted
of
william
carey
soon
after
he
was
ordained
it
represented
a
thin
young
curate
with
long
hair
that
fell
over
his
head
in
natural
curls
with
dark
eyes
large
and
dreamy
and
a
pale
ascetic
face
philip
remembered
the
chuckle
with
which
his
uncle
used
to
tell
of
the
dozens
of
slippers
which
were
worked
for
him
by
adoring
ladies
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
and
all
the
evening
philip
toiled
through
the
innumerable
correspondence
he
glanced
at
the
address
and
at
the
signature
then
tore
the
letter
in
two
and
threw
it
into
the
washingbasket
by
his
side
suddenly
he
came
upon
one
signed
helen
he
did
not
know
the
writing
it
was
thin
angular
and
oldfashioned
it
began
my
dear
william
and
ended
your
affectionate
sister
then
it
struck
him
that
it
was
from
his
own
mother
he
had
never
seen
a
letter
of
hers
before
and
her
handwriting
was
strange
to
him
it
was
about
himself
my
dear
william
stephen
wrote
to
you
to
thank
you
for
your
congratulations
on
the
birth
of
our
son
and
your
kind
wishes
to
myself
thank
god
we
are
both
well
and
i
am
deeply
thankful
for
the
great
mercy
which
has
been
shown
me
now
that
i
can
hold
a
pen
i
want
to
tell
you
and
dear
louisa
myself
how
truly
grateful
i
am
to
you
both
for
all
your
kindness
to
me
now
and
always
since
my
marriage
i
am
going
to
ask
you
to
do
me
a
great
favour
both
stephen
and
i
wish
you
to
be
the
boys
godfather
and
we
hope
that
you
will
consent
i
know
i
am
not
asking
a
small
thing
for
i
am
sure
you
will
take
the
responsibilities
of
the
position
very
seriously
but
i
am
especially
anxious
that
you
should
undertake
this
office
because
you
are
a
clergyman
as
well
as
the
boys
uncle
i
am
very
anxious
for
the
boys
welfare
and
i
pray
god
night
and
day
that
he
may
grow
into
a
good
honest
and
christian
man
with
you
to
guide
him
i
hope
that
he
will
become
a
soldier
in
christs
faith
and
be
all
the
days
of
his
life
godfearing
humble
and
pious
your
affectionate
sister
helen
philip
pushed
the
letter
away
and
leaning
forward
rested
his
face
on
his
hands
it
deeply
touched
and
at
the
same
time
surprised
him
he
was
astonished
at
its
religious
tone
which
seemed
to
him
neither
mawkish
nor
sentimental
he
knew
nothing
of
his
mother
dead
now
for
nearly
twenty
years
but
that
she
was
beautiful
and
it
was
strange
to
learn
that
she
was
simple
and
pious
he
had
never
thought
of
that
side
of
her
he
read
again
what
she
said
about
him
what
she
expected
and
thought
about
him
he
had
turned
out
very
differently
he
looked
at
himself
for
a
moment
perhaps
it
was
better
that
she
was
dead
then
a
sudden
impulse
caused
him
to
tear
up
the
letter
its
tenderness
and
simplicity
made
it
seem
peculiarly
private
he
had
a
queer
feeling
that
there
was
something
indecent
in
his
reading
what
exposed
his
mothers
gentle
soul
he
went
on
with
the
vicars
dreary
correspondence
a
few
days
later
he
went
up
to
london
and
for
the
first
time
for
two
years
entered
by
day
the
hall
of
st
lukes
hospital
he
went
to
see
the
secretary
of
the
medical
school
he
was
surprised
to
see
him
and
asked
philip
curiously
what
he
had
been
doing
philips
experiences
had
given
him
a
certain
confidence
in
himself
and
a
different
outlook
upon
many
things
such
a
question
would
have
embarrassed
him
before
but
now
he
answered
coolly
with
a
deliberate
vagueness
which
prevented
further
inquiry
that
private
affairs
had
obliged
him
to
make
a
break
in
the
curriculum
he
was
now
anxious
to
qualify
as
soon
as
possible
the
first
examination
he
could
take
was
in
midwifery
and
the
diseases
of
women
and
he
put
his
name
down
to
be
a
clerk
in
the
ward
devoted
to
feminine
ailments
since
it
was
holiday
time
there
happened
to
be
no
difficulty
in
getting
a
post
as
obstetric
clerk
he
arranged
to
undertake
that
duty
during
the
last
week
of
august
and
the
first
two
of
september
after
this
interview
philip
walked
through
the
medical
school
more
or
less
deserted
for
the
examinations
at
the
end
of
the
summer
session
were
all
over
and
he
wandered
along
the
terrace
by
the
riverside
his
heart
was
full
he
thought
that
now
he
could
begin
a
new
life
and
he
would
put
behind
him
all
the
errors
follies
and
miseries
of
the
past
the
flowing
river
suggested
that
everything
passed
was
passing
always
and
nothing
mattered
the
future
was
before
him
rich
with
possibilities
he
went
back
to
blackstable
and
busied
himself
with
the
settling
up
of
his
uncles
estate
the
auction
was
fixed
for
the
middle
of
august
when
the
presence
of
visitors
for
the
summer
holidays
would
make
it
possible
to
get
better
prices
catalogues
were
made
out
and
sent
to
the
various
dealers
in
secondhand
books
at
tercanbury
maidstone
and
ashford
one
afternoon
philip
took
it
into
his
head
to
go
over
to
tercanbury
and
see
his
old
school
he
had
not
been
there
since
the
day
when
with
relief
in
his
heart
he
had
left
it
with
the
feeling
that
thenceforward
he
was
his
own
master
it
was
strange
to
wander
through
the
narrow
streets
of
tercanbury
which
he
had
known
so
well
for
so
many
years
he
looked
at
the
old
shops
still
there
still
selling
the
same
things
the
booksellers
with
schoolbooks
pious
works
and
the
latest
novels
in
one
window
and
photographs
of
the
cathedral
and
of
the
city
in
the
other
the
games
shop
with
its
cricket
bats
fishing
tackle
tennis
rackets
and
footballs
the
tailor
from
whom
he
had
got
clothes
all
through
his
boyhood
and
the
fishmonger
where
his
uncle
whenever
he
came
to
tercanbury
bought
fish
he
wandered
along
the
sordid
street
in
which
behind
a
high
wall
lay
the
red
brick
house
which
was
the
preparatory
school
further
on
was
the
gateway
that
led
into
kings
school
and
he
stood
in
the
quadrangle
round
which
were
the
various
buildings
it
was
just
four
and
the
boys
were
hurrying
out
of
school
he
saw
the
masters
in
their
gowns
and
mortarboards
and
they
were
strange
to
him
it
was
more
than
ten
years
since
he
had
left
and
many
changes
had
taken
place
he
saw
the
headmaster
he
walked
slowly
down
from
the
schoolhouse
to
his
own
talking
to
a
big
boy
who
philip
supposed
was
in
the
sixth
he
was
little
changed
tall
cadaverous
romantic
as
philip
remembered
him
with
the
same
wild
eyes
but
the
black
beard
was
streaked
with
gray
now
and
the
dark
sallow
face
was
more
deeply
lined
philip
had
an
impulse
to
go
up
and
speak
to
him
but
he
was
afraid
he
would
have
forgotten
him
and
he
hated
the
thought
of
explaining
who
he
was
boys
lingered
talking
to
one
another
and
presently
some
who
had
hurried
to
change
came
out
to
play
fives
others
straggled
out
in
twos
and
threes
and
went
out
of
the
gateway
philip
knew
they
were
going
up
to
the
cricket
ground
others
again
went
into
the
precincts
to
bat
at
the
nets
philip
stood
among
them
a
stranger
one
or
two
gave
him
an
indifferent
glance
but
visitors
attracted
by
the
norman
staircase
were
not
rare
and
excited
little
attention
philip
looked
at
them
curiously
he
thought
with
melancholy
of
the
distance
that
separated
him
from
them
and
he
thought
bitterly
how
much
he
had
wanted
to
do
and
how
little
done
it
seemed
to
him
that
all
those
years
vanished
beyond
recall
had
been
utterly
wasted
the
boys
fresh
and
buoyant
were
doing
the
same
things
that
he
had
done
it
seemed
that
not
a
day
had
passed
since
he
left
the
school
and
yet
in
that
place
where
at
least
by
name
he
had
known
everybody
now
he
knew
not
a
soul
in
a
few
years
these
too
others
taking
their
place
would
stand
alien
as
he
stood
but
the
reflection
brought
him
no
solace
it
merely
impressed
upon
him
the
futility
of
human
existence
each
generation
repeated
the
trivial
round
he
wondered
what
had
become
of
the
boys
who
were
his
companions
they
were
nearly
thirty
now
some
would
be
dead
but
others
were
married
and
had
children
they
were
soldiers
and
parsons
doctors
lawyers
they
were
staid
men
who
were
beginning
to
put
youth
behind
them
had
any
of
them
made
such
a
hash
of
life
as
he
he
thought
of
the
boy
he
had
been
devoted
to
it
was
funny
he
could
not
recall
his
name
he
remembered
exactly
what
he
looked
like
he
had
been
his
greatest
friend
but
his
name
would
not
come
back
to
him
he
looked
back
with
amusement
on
the
jealous
emotions
he
had
suffered
on
his
account
it
was
irritating
not
to
recollect
his
name
he
longed
to
be
a
boy
again
like
those
he
saw
sauntering
through
the
quadrangle
so
that
avoiding
his
mistakes
he
might
start
fresh
and
make
something
more
out
of
life
he
felt
an
intolerable
loneliness
he
almost
regretted
the
penury
which
he
had
suffered
during
the
last
two
years
since
the
desperate
struggle
merely
to
keep
body
and
soul
together
had
deadened
the
pain
of
living
in
the
sweat
of
thy
brow
shalt
thou
earn
thy
daily
bread
it
was
not
a
curse
upon
mankind
but
the
balm
which
reconciled
it
to
existence
but
philip
was
impatient
with
himself
he
called
to
mind
his
idea
of
the
pattern
of
life
the
unhappiness
he
had
suffered
was
no
more
than
part
of
a
decoration
which
was
elaborate
and
beautiful
he
told
himself
strenuously
that
he
must
accept
with
gaiety
everything
dreariness
and
excitement
pleasure
and
pain
because
it
added
to
the
richness
of
the
design
he
sought
for
beauty
consciously
and
he
remembered
how
even
as
a
boy
he
had
taken
pleasure
in
the
gothic
cathedral
as
one
saw
it
from
the
precincts
he
went
there
and
looked
at
the
massive
pile
gray
under
the
cloudy
sky
with
the
central
tower
that
rose
like
the
praise
of
men
to
their
god
but
the
boys
were
batting
at
the
nets
and
they
were
lissom
and
strong
and
active
he
could
not
help
hearing
their
shouts
and
laughter
the
cry
of
youth
was
insistent
and
he
saw
the
beautiful
thing
before
him
only
with
his
eyes
chapter
cxiii
at
the
beginning
of
the
last
week
in
august
philip
entered
upon
his
duties
in
the
district
they
were
arduous
for
he
had
to
attend
on
an
average
three
confinements
a
day
the
patient
had
obtained
a
card
from
the
hospital
some
time
before
and
when
her
time
came
it
was
taken
to
the
porter
by
a
messenger
generally
a
little
girl
who
was
then
sent
across
the
road
to
the
house
in
which
philip
lodged
at
night
the
porter
who
had
a
latchkey
himself
came
over
and
awoke
philip
it
was
mysterious
then
to
get
up
in
the
darkness
and
walk
through
the
deserted
streets
of
the
south
side
at
those
hours
it
was
generally
the
husband
who
brought
the
card
if
there
had
been
a
number
of
babies
before
he
took
it
for
the
most
part
with
surly
indifference
but
if
newly
married
he
was
nervous
and
then
sometimes
strove
to
allay
his
anxiety
by
getting
drunk
often
there
was
a
mile
or
more
to
walk
during
which
philip
and
the
messenger
discussed
the
conditions
of
labour
and
the
cost
of
living
philip
learnt
about
the
various
trades
which
were
practised
on
that
side
of
the
river
he
inspired
confidence
in
the
people
among
whom
he
was
thrown
and
during
the
long
hours
that
he
waited
in
a
stuffy
room
the
woman
in
labour
lying
on
a
large
bed
that
took
up
half
of
it
her
mother
and
the
midwife
talked
to
him
as
naturally
as
they
talked
to
one
another
the
circumstances
in
which
he
had
lived
during
the
last
two
years
had
taught
him
several
things
about
the
life
of
the
very
poor
which
it
amused
them
to
find
he
knew
and
they
were
impressed
because
he
was
not
deceived
by
their
little
subterfuges
he
was
kind
and
he
had
gentle
hands
and
he
did
not
lose
his
temper
they
were
pleased
because
he
was
not
above
drinking
a
cup
of
tea
with
them
and
when
the
dawn
came
and
they
were
still
waiting
they
offered
him
a
slice
of
bread
and
dripping
he
was
not
squeamish
and
could
eat
most
things
now
with
a
good
appetite
some
of
the
houses
he
went
to
in
filthy
courts
off
a
dingy
street
huddled
against
one
another
without
light
or
air
were
merely
squalid
but
others
unexpectedly
though
dilapidated
with
wormeaten
floors
and
leaking
roofs
had
the
grand
air
you
found
in
them
oak
balusters
exquisitely
carved
and
the
walls
had
still
their
panelling
these
were
thickly
inhabited
one
family
lived
in
each
room
and
in
the
daytime
there
was
the
incessant
noise
of
children
playing
in
the
court
the
old
walls
were
the
breedingplace
of
vermin
the
air
was
so
foul
that
often
feeling
sick
philip
had
to
light
his
pipe
the
people
who
dwelt
here
lived
from
hand
to
mouth
babies
were
unwelcome
the
man
received
them
with
surly
anger
the
mother
with
despair
it
was
one
more
mouth
to
feed
and
there
was
little
enough
wherewith
to
feed
those
already
there
philip
often
discerned
the
wish
that
the
child
might
be
born
dead
or
might
die
quickly
he
delivered
one
woman
of
twins
a
source
of
humour
to
the
facetious
and
when
she
was
told
she
burst
into
a
long
shrill
wail
of
misery
her
mother
said
outright
i
dont
know
how
theyre
going
to
feed
em
maybe
the
lordll
see
fit
to
take
em
to
imself
said
the
midwife
philip
caught
sight
of
the
husbands
face
as
he
looked
at
the
tiny
pair
lying
side
by
side
and
there
was
a
ferocious
sullenness
in
it
which
startled
him
he
felt
in
the
family
assembled
there
a
hideous
resentment
against
those
poor
atoms
who
had
come
into
the
world
unwished
for
and
he
had
a
suspicion
that
if
he
did
not
speak
firmly
an
accident
would
occur
accidents
occurred
often
mothers
overlay
their
babies
and
perhaps
errors
of
diet
were
not
always
the
result
of
carelessness
i
shall
come
every
day
he
said
i
warn
you
that
if
anything
happens
to
them
therell
have
to
be
an
inquest
the
father
made
no
reply
but
he
gave
philip
a
scowl
there
was
murder
in
his
soul
bless
their
little
earts
said
the
grandmother
what
should
appen
to
them
the
great
difficulty
was
to
keep
the
mothers
in
bed
for
ten
days
which
was
the
minimum
upon
which
the
hospital
practice
insisted
it
was
awkward
to
look
after
the
family
no
one
would
see
to
the
children
without
payment
and
the
husband
tumbled
because
his
tea
was
not
right
when
he
came
home
tired
from
his
work
and
hungry
philip
had
heard
that
the
poor
helped
one
another
but
woman
after
woman
complained
to
him
that
she
could
not
get
anyone
in
to
clean
up
and
see
to
the
childrens
dinner
without
paying
for
the
service
and
she
could
not
afford
to
pay
by
listening
to
the
women
as
they
talked
and
by
chance
remarks
from
which
he
could
deduce
much
that
was
left
unsaid
philip
learned
how
little
there
was
in
common
between
the
poor
and
the
classes
above
them
they
did
not
envy
their
betters
for
the
life
was
too
different
and
they
had
an
ideal
of
ease
which
made
the
existence
of
the
middleclasses
seem
formal
and
stiff
moreover
they
had
a
certain
contempt
for
them
because
they
were
soft
and
did
not
work
with
their
hands
the
proud
merely
wished
to
be
left
alone
but
the
majority
looked
upon
the
welltodo
as
people
to
be
exploited
they
knew
what
to
say
in
order
to
get
such
advantages
as
the
charitable
put
at
their
disposal
and
they
accepted
benefits
as
a
right
which
came
to
them
from
the
folly
of
their
superiors
and
their
own
astuteness
they
bore
the
curate
with
contemptuous
indifference
but
the
district
visitor
excited
their
bitter
hatred
she
came
in
and
opened
your
windows
without
so
much
as
a
by
your
leave
or
with
your
leave
and
me
with
my
bronchitis
enough
to
give
me
my
death
of
cold
she
poked
her
nose
into
corners
and
if
she
didnt
say
the
place
was
dirty
you
saw
what
she
thought
right
enough
an
its
all
very
well
for
them
as
as
servants
but
id
like
to
see
what
shed
make
of
er
room
if
she
ad
four
children
and
ad
to
do
the
cookin
and
mend
their
clothes
and
wash
them
philip
discovered
that
the
greatest
tragedy
of
life
to
these
people
was
not
separation
or
death
that
was
natural
and
the
grief
of
it
could
be
assuaged
with
tears
but
loss
of
work
he
saw
a
man
come
home
one
afternoon
three
days
after
his
wifes
confinement
and
tell
her
he
had
been
dismissed
he
was
a
builder
and
at
that
time
work
was
slack
he
stated
the
fact
and
sat
down
to
his
tea
oh
jim
she
said
the
man
ate
stolidly
some
mess
which
had
been
stewing
in
a
saucepan
against
his
coming
he
stared
at
his
plate
his
wife
looked
at
him
two
or
three
times
with
little
startled
glances
and
then
quite
silently
began
to
cry
the
builder
was
an
uncouth
little
fellow
with
a
rough
weatherbeaten
face
and
a
long
white
scar
on
his
forehead
he
had
large
stubbly
hands
presently
he
pushed
aside
his
plate
as
if
he
must
give
up
the
effort
to
force
himself
to
eat
and
turned
a
fixed
gaze
out
of
the
window
the
room
was
at
the
top
of
the
house
at
the
back
and
one
saw
nothing
but
sullen
clouds
the
silence
seemed
heavy
with
despair
philip
felt
that
there
was
nothing
to
be
said
he
could
only
go
and
as
he
walked
away
wearily
for
he
had
been
up
most
of
the
night
his
heart
was
filled
with
rage
against
the
cruelty
of
the
world
he
knew
the
hopelessness
of
the
search
for
work
and
the
desolation
which
is
harder
to
bear
than
hunger
he
was
thankful
not
to
have
to
believe
in
god
for
then
such
a
condition
of
things
would
be
intolerable
one
could
reconcile
oneself
to
existence
only
because
it
was
meaningless
it
seemed
to
philip
that
the
people
who
spent
their
time
in
helping
the
poorer
classes
erred
because
they
sought
to
remedy
things
which
would
harass
them
if
themselves
had
to
endure
them
without
thinking
that
they
did
not
in
the
least
disturb
those
who
were
used
to
them
the
poor
did
not
want
large
airy
rooms
they
suffered
from
cold
for
their
food
was
not
nourishing
and
their
circulation
bad
space
gave
them
a
feeling
of
chilliness
and
they
wanted
to
burn
as
little
coal
as
need
be
there
was
no
hardship
for
several
to
sleep
in
one
room
they
preferred
it
they
were
never
alone
for
a
moment
from
the
time
they
were
born
to
the
time
they
died
and
loneliness
oppressed
them
they
enjoyed
the
promiscuity
in
which
they
dwelt
and
the
constant
noise
of
their
surroundings
pressed
upon
their
ears
unnoticed
they
did
not
feel
the
need
of
taking
a
bath
constantly
and
philip
often
heard
them
speak
with
indignation
of
the
necessity
to
do
so
with
which
they
were
faced
on
entering
the
hospital
it
was
both
an
affront
and
a
discomfort
they
wanted
chiefly
to
be
left
alone
then
if
the
man
was
in
regular
work
life
went
easily
and
was
not
without
its
pleasures
there
was
plenty
of
time
for
gossip
after
the
days
work
a
glass
of
beer
was
very
good
to
drink
the
streets
were
a
constant
source
of
entertainment
if
you
wanted
to
read
there
was
reynolds
or
the
news
of
the
world
but
there
you
couldnt
make
out
ow
the
time
did
fly
the
truth
was
and
thats
a
fact
you
was
a
rare
one
for
reading
when
you
was
a
girl
but
what
with
one
thing
and
another
you
didnt
get
no
time
now
not
even
to
read
the
paper
the
usual
practice
was
to
pay
three
visits
after
a
confinement
and
one
sunday
philip
went
to
see
a
patient
at
the
dinner
hour
she
was
up
for
the
first
time
i
couldnt
stay
in
bed
no
longer
i
really
couldnt
im
not
one
for
idling
and
it
gives
me
the
fidgets
to
be
there
and
do
nothing
all
day
long
so
i
said
to
erb
im
just
going
to
get
up
and
cook
your
dinner
for
you
erb
was
sitting
at
table
with
his
knife
and
fork
already
in
his
hands
he
was
a
young
man
with
an
open
face
and
blue
eyes
he
was
earning
good
money
and
as
things
went
the
couple
were
in
easy
circumstances
they
had
only
been
married
a
few
months
and
were
both
delighted
with
the
rosy
boy
who
lay
in
the
cradle
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
there
was
a
savoury
smell
of
beefsteak
in
the
room
and
philips
eyes
turned
to
the
range
i
was
just
going
to
dish
up
this
minute
said
the
woman
fire
away
said
philip

a
look

son
and
heir
and
then
ill

laughed
at
philips
expression
and
erb
getting
up
went
over
with
philip
to
the
cradle
he
looked
at
his
baby
proudly
there
doesnt
seem
much
wrong
with
him
does
there
said
philip
he
took
up
his
hat
and
by
this
time
erbs
wife
had
dished
up
the
beefsteak
and
put
on
the
table
a
plate
of
green
peas

smiled
philip

philip
with
his
attractive
smile

was
flustered
and
she
thought
erb
a
regular
caution
you
never
knew
what
ideas
ed
get
in
is
ead
next
but
she
got
a
plate
and
wiped
it
quickly
with
her
apron
then
took
a
new
knife
and
fork
from
the
chest
of
drawers
where
her
best
cutlery
rested
among
her
best
clothes
there
was
a
jug
of
stout
on
the
table
and
erb
poured
philip
out
a
glass
he
wanted
to
give
him
the
lions
share
of
the
beefsteak
but
philip
insisted
that
they
should
share
alike
it
was
a
sunny
room
with
two
windows
that
reached
to
the
floor
it
had
been
the
parlour
of
a
house
which
at
one
time
was
if
not
fashionable
at
least
respectable
it
might
have
been
inhabited
fifty
years
before
by
a
welltodo
tradesman
or
an
officer
on
half
pay
erb
had
been
a
football
player
before
he
married
and
there
were
photographs
on
the
wall
of
various
teams
in
selfconscious
attitudes
with
neatly
plastered
hair
the
captain
seated
proudly
in
the
middle
holding
a
cup
there
were
other
signs
of
prosperity
photographs
of
the
relations
of
erb
and
his
wife
in
sunday
clothes
on
the
chimneypiece
an
elaborate
arrangement
of
shells
stuck
on
a
miniature
rock
and
on
each
side
mugs
a
present
from
southend
in
gothic
letters
with
pictures
of
a
pier
and
a
parade
on
them
erb
was
something
of
a
character
he
was
a
nonunion
man
and
expressed
himself
with
indignation
at
the
efforts
of
the
union
to
force
him
to
join
the
union
wasnt
no
good
to
him
he
never
found
no
difficulty
in
getting
work
and
there
was
good
wages
for
anyone
as
ad
a
head
on
his
shoulders

thoroughly
enjoyed
it
well
goodbye

a
next
time
chapter
cxiv
the
three
weeks
which
the
appointment
lasted
drew
to
an
end
philip
had
attended
sixtytwo
cases
and
he
was
tired
out
when
he
came
home
about
ten
oclock
on
his
last
night
he
hoped
with
all
his
heart
that
he
would
not
be
called
out
again
he
had
not
had
a
whole
nights
rest
for
ten
days
the
case
which
he
had
just
come
from
was
horrible
he
had
been
fetched
by
a
huge
burly
man
the
worse
for
liquor
and
taken
to
a
room
in
an
evilsmelling
court
which
was
filthier
than
any
he
had
seen
it
was
a
tiny
attic
most
of
the
space
was
taken
up
by
a
wooden
bed
with
a
canopy
of
dirty
red
hangings
and
the
ceiling
was
so
low
that
philip
could
touch
it
with
the
tips
of
his
fingers
with
the
solitary
candle
that
afforded
what
light
there
was
he
went
over
it
frizzling
up
the
bugs
that
crawled
upon
it
the
woman
was
a
blowsy
creature
of
middle
age
who
had
had
a
long
succession
of
stillborn
children
it
was
a
story
that
philip
was
not
unaccustomed
to
the
husband
had
been
a
soldier
in
india
the
legislation
forced
upon
that
country
by
the
prudery
of
the
english
public
had
given
a
free
run
to
the
most
distressing
of
all
diseases
the
innocent
suffered
yawning
philip
undressed
and
took
a
bath
then
shook
his
clothes
over
the
water
and
watched
the
animals
that
fell
out
wriggling
he
was
just
going
to
get
into
bed
when
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
and
the
hospital
porter
brought
him
a
card
curse
you
said
philip
youre
the
last
person
i
wanted
to
see
tonight
whos
brought
it
i
think
its
the
usband
sir
shall
i
tell
him
to
wait
philip
looked
at
the
address
saw
that
the
street
was
familiar
to
him
and
told
the
porter
that
he
would
find
his
own
way
he
dressed
himself
and
in
five
minutes
with
his
black
bag
in
his
hand
stepped
into
the
street
a
man
whom
he
could
not
see
in
the
darkness
came
up
to
him
and
said
he
was
the
husband
i
thought
id
better
wait
sir
he
said
its
a
pretty
rough
neighbourood
and
them
not
knowing
who
you
was
philip
laughed
bless
your
heart
they
all
know
the
doctor
ive
been
in
some
damned
sight
rougher
places
than
waver
street
it
was
quite
true
the
black
bag
was
a
passport
through
wretched
alleys
and
down
foulsmelling
courts
into
which
a
policeman
was
not
ready
to
venture
by
himself
once
or
twice
a
little
group
of
men
had
looked
at
philip
curiously
as
he
passed
he
heard
a
mutter
of
observations
and
then
one
say
its
the
orspital
doctor
as
he
went
by
one
or
two
of
them
said
goodnight
sir
we
shall
ave
to
step
out
if
you
dont
mind
sir
said
the
man
who
accompanied
him
now
they
told
me
there
was
no
time
to
lose
why
did
you
leave
it
so
late
asked
philip
as
he
quickened
his
pace
he
glanced
at
the
fellow
as
they
passed
a
lamppost
you
look
awfully
young
he
said
im
turned
eighteen
sir
he
was
fair
and
he
had
not
a
hair
on
his
face
he
looked
no
more
than
a
boy
he
was
short
but
thick
set
youre
young
to
be
married
said
philip
we
ad
to
how
much
dyou
earn
sixteen
sir
sixteen
shillings
a
week
was
not
much
to
keep
a
wife
and
child
on
the
room
the
couple
lived
in
showed
that
their
poverty
was
extreme
it
was
a
fair
size
but
it
looked
quite
large
since
there
was
hardly
any
furniture
in
it
there
was
no
carpet
on
the
floor
there
were
no
pictures
on
the
walls
and
most
rooms
had
something
photographs
or
supplements
in
cheap
frames
from
the
christmas
numbers
of
the
illustrated
papers
the
patient
lay
on
a
little
iron
bed
of
the
cheapest
sort
it
startled
philip
to
see
how
young
she
was
by
jove
she
cant
be
more
than
sixteen
he
said
to
the
woman
who
had
come
in
to
see
her
through
she
had
given
her
age
as
eighteen
on
the
card
but
when
they
were
very
young
they
often
put
on
a
year
or
two
also
she
was
pretty
which
was
rare
in
those
classes
in
which
the
constitution
has
been
undermined
by
bad
food
bad
air
and
unhealthy
occupations
she
had
delicate
features
and
large
blue
eyes
and
a
mass
of
dark
hair
done
in
the
elaborate
fashion
of
the
coster
girl
she
and
her
husband
were
very
nervous
youd
better
wait
outside
so
as
to
be
at
hand
if
i
want
you
philip
said
to
him
now
that
he
saw
him
better
philip
was
surprised
again
at
his
boyish
air
you
felt
that
he
should
be
larking
in
the
street
with
the
other
lads
instead
of
waiting
anxiously
for
the
birth
of
a
child
the
hours
passed
and
it
was
not
till
nearly
two
that
the
baby
was
born
everything
seemed
to
be
going
satisfactorily
the
husband
was
called
in
and
it
touched
philip
to
see
the
awkward
shy
way
in
which
he
kissed
his
wife
philip
packed
up
his
things
before
going
he
felt
once
more
his
patients
pulse
hulloa
he
said
he
looked
at
her
quickly
something
had
happened
in
cases
of
emergency
the
s
o
csenior
obstetric
clerkhad
to
be
sent
for
he
was
a
qualified
man
and
the
district
was
in
his
charge
philip
scribbled
a
note
and
giving
it
to
the
husband
told
him
to
run
with
it
to
the
hospital
he
bade
him
hurry
for
his
wife
was
in
a
dangerous
state
the
man
set
off
philip
waited
anxiously
he
knew
the
woman
was
bleeding
to
death
he
was
afraid
she
would
die
before
his
chief
arrived
he
took
what
steps
he
could
he
hoped
fervently
that
the
s
o
c
would
not
have
been
called
elsewhere
the
minutes
were
interminable
he
came
at
last
and
while
he
examined
the
patient
in
a
low
voice
asked
philip
questions
philip
saw
by
his
face
that
he
thought
the
case
very
grave
his
name
was
chandler
he
was
a
tall
man
of
few
words
with
a
long
nose
and
a
thin
face
much
lined
for
his
age
he
shook
his
head
it
was
hopeless
from
the
beginning
wheres
the
husband
i
told
him
to
wait
on
the
stairs
said
philip
youd
better
bring
him
in
philip
opened
the
door
and
called
him
he
was
sitting
in
the
dark
on
the
first
step
of
the
flight
that
led
to
the
next
floor
he
came
up
to
the
bed
whats
the
matter
he
asked
why
theres
internal
bleeding
its
impossible
to
stop
it
the
s
o
c
hesitated
a
moment
and
because
it
was
a
painful
thing
to
say
he
forced
his
voice
to
become
brusque
shes
dying
the
man
did
not
say
a
word
he
stopped
quite
still
looking
at
his
wife
who
lay
pale
and
unconscious
on
the
bed
it
was
the
midwife
who
spoke
the
gentlemen
ave
done
all
they
could
arry
she
said
i
saw
what
was
comin
from
the
first
shut
up
said
chandler
there
were
no
curtains
on
the
windows
and
gradually
the
night
seemed
to
lighten
it
was
not
yet
the
dawn
but
the
dawn
was
at
hand
chandler
was
keeping
the
woman
alive
by
all
the
means
in
his
power
but
life
was
slipping
away
from
her
and
suddenly
she
died
the
boy
who
was
her
husband
stood
at
the
end
of
the
cheap
iron
bed
with
his
hands
resting
on
the
rail
he
did
not
speak
but
he
looked
very
pale
and
once
or
twice
chandler
gave
him
an
uneasy
glance
thinking
he
was
going
to
faint
his
lips
were
gray
the
midwife
sobbed
noisily
but
he
took
no
notice
of
her
his
eyes
were
fixed
upon
his
wife
and
in
them
was
an
utter
bewilderment
he
reminded
you
of
a
dog
whipped
for
something
he
did
not
know
was
wrong
when
chandler
and
philip
had
gathered
together
their
things
chandler
turned
to
the
husband
youd
better
lie
down
for
a
bit
i
expect
youre
about
done
up
theres
nowhere
for
me
to
lie
down
sir
he
answered
and
there
was
in
his
voice
a
humbleness
which
was
very
distressing
dont
you
know
anyone
in
the
house
wholl
give
you
a
shakedown
no
sir
they
only
moved
in
last
week
said
the
midwife
they
dont
know
nobody
yet
chandler
hesitated
a
moment
awkwardly
then
he
went
up
to
the
man
and
said
im
very
sorry
this
has
happened
he
held
out
his
hand
and
the
man
with
an
instinctive
glance
at
his
own
to
see
if
it
was
clean
shook
it
thank
you
sir
philip
shook
hands
with
him
too
chandler
told
the
midwife
to
come
and
fetch
the
certificate
in
the
morning
they
left
the
house
and
walked
along
together
in
silence
it
upsets
one
a
bit
at
first
doesnt
it
said
chandler
at
last
a
bit
answered
philip
if
you
like
ill
tell
the
porter
not
to
bring
you
any
more
calls
tonight
im
off
duty
at
eight
in
the
morning
in
any
case
how
many
cases
have
you
had
sixtythree
good
youll
get
your
certificate
then
they
arrived
at
the
hospital
and
the
s
o
c
went
in
to
see
if
anyone
wanted
him
philip
walked
on
it
had
been
very
hot
all
the
day
before
and
even
now
in
the
early
morning
there
was
a
balminess
in
the
air
the
street
was
very
still
philip
did
not
feel
inclined
to
go
to
bed
it
was
the
end
of
his
work
aud
he
need
not
hurry
he
strolled
along
glad
of
the
fresh
air
and
the
silence
he
thought
that
he
would
go
on
to
the
bridge
and
look
at
day
break
on
the
river
a
policeman
at
the
corner
bade
him
goodmorning
he
knew
who
philip
was
from
his
bag
out
late
tonight
sir
he
said
philip
nodded
and
passed
he
leaned
against
the
parapet
and
looked
towards
the
morning
at
that
hour
the
great
city
was
like
a
city
of
the
dead
the
sky
was
cloudless
but
the
stars
were
dim
at
the
approach
of
day
there
was
a
light
mist
on
the
river
and
the
great
buildings
on
the
north
side
were
like
palaces
in
an
enchanted
island
a
group
of
barges
was
moored
in
midstream
it
was
all
of
an
unearthly
violet
troubling
somehow
and
aweinspiring
but
quickly
everything
grew
pale
and
cold
and
gray
then
the
sun
rose
a
ray
of
yellow
gold
stole
across
the
sky
and
the
sky
was
iridescent
philip
could
not
get
out
of
his
eyes
the
dead
girl
lying
on
the
bed
wan
and
white
and
the
boy
who
stood
at
the
end
of
it
like
a
stricken
beast
the
bareness
of
the
squalid
room
made
the
pain
of
it
more
poignant
it
was
cruel
that
a
stupid
chance
should
have
cut
off
her
life
when
she
was
just
entering
upon
it
but
in
the
very
moment
of
saying
this
to
himself
philip
thought
of
the
life
which
had
been
in
store
for
her
the
bearing
of
children
the
dreary
fight
with
poverty
the
youth
broken
by
toil
and
deprivation
into
a
slatternly
middle
agehe
saw
the
pretty
face
grow
thin
and
white
the
hair
grow
scanty
the
pretty
hands
worn
down
brutally
by
work
become
like
the
claws
of
an
old
animalthen
when
the
man
was
past
his
prime
the
difficulty
of
getting
jobs
the
small
wages
he
had
to
take
and
the
inevitable
abject
penury
of
the
end
she
might
be
energetic
thrifty
industrious
it
would
not
have
saved
her
in
the
end
was
the
workhouse
or
subsistence
on
the
charity
of
her
children
who
could
pity
her
because
she
had
died
when
life
offered
so
little
but
pity
was
inane
philip
felt
it
was
not
that
which
these
people
needed
they
did
not
pity
themselves
they
accepted
their
fate
it
was
the
natural
order
of
things
otherwise
good
heavens
otherwise
they
would
swarm
over
the
river
in
their
multitude
to
the
side
where
those
great
buildings
were
secure
and
stately
and
they
would
pillage
burn
and
sack
but
the
day
tender
and
pale
had
broken
now
and
the
mist
was
tenuous
it
bathed
everything
in
a
soft
radiance
and
the
thames
was
gray
rosy
and
green
gray
like
motherofpearl
and
green
like
the
heart
of
a
yellow
rose
the
wharfs
and
storehouses
of
the
surrey
side
were
massed
in
disorderly
loveliness
the
scene
was
so
exquisite
that
philips
heart
beat
passionately
he
was
overwhelmed
by
the
beauty
of
the
world
beside
that
nothing
seemed
to
matter
chapter
cxv
philip
spent
the
few
weeks
that
remained
before
the
beginning
of
the
winter
session
in
the
outpatients
department
and
in
october
settled
down
to
regular
work
he
had
been
away
from
the
hospital
for
so
long
that
he
found
himself
very
largely
among
new
people
the
men
of
different
years
had
little
to
do
with
one
another
and
his
contemporaries
were
now
mostly
qualified
some
had
left
to
take
up
assistantships
or
posts
in
country
hospitals
and
infirmaries
and
some
held
appointments
at
st
lukes
the
two
years
during
which
his
mind
had
lain
fallow
had
refreshed
him
he
fancied
and
he
was
able
now
to
work
with
energy
the
athelnys
were
delighted
with
his
change
of
fortune
he
had
kept
aside
a
few
things
from
the
sale
of
his
uncles
effects
and
gave
them
all
presents
he
gave
sally
a
gold
chain
that
had
belonged
to
his
aunt
she
was
now
grown
up
she
was
apprenticed
to
a
dressmaker
and
set
out
every
morning
at
eight
to
work
all
day
in
a
shop
in
regent
street
sally
had
frank
blue
eyes
a
broad
brow
and
plentiful
shining
hair
she
was
buxom
with
broad
hips
and
full
breasts
and
her
father
who
was
fond
of
discussing
her
appearance
warned
her
constantly
that
she
must
not
grow
fat
she
attracted
because
she
was
healthy
animal
and
feminine
she
had
many
admirers
but
they
left
her
unmoved
she
gave
one
the
impression
that
she
looked
upon
lovemaking
as
nonsense
and
it
was
easy
to
imagine
that
young
men
found
her
unapproachable
sally
was
old
for
her
years
she
had
been
used
to
help
her
mother
in
the
household
work
and
in
the
care
of
the
children
so
that
she
had
acquired
a
managing
air
which
made
her
mother
say
that
sally
was
a
bit
too
fond
of
having
things
her
own
way
she
did
not
speak
very
much
but
as
she
grew
older
she
seemed
to
be
acquiring
a
quiet
sense
of
humour
and
sometimes
uttered
a
remark
which
suggested
that
beneath
her
impassive
exterior
she
was
quietly
bubbling
with
amusement
at
her
fellowcreatures
philip
found
that
with
her
he
never
got
on
the
terms
of
affectionate
intimacy
upon
which
he
was
with
the
rest
of
athelnys
huge
family
now
and
then
her
indifference
slightly
irritated
him
there
was
something
enigmatic
in
her
when
philip
gave
her
the
necklace
athelny
in
his
boisterous
way
insisted
that
she
must
kiss
him
but
sally
reddened
and
drew
back
no
im
not
going
to
she
said
ungrateful
hussy
cried
athelny
why
not
i
dont
like
being
kissed
by
men
she
said
philip
saw
her
embarrassment
and
amused
turned
athelnys
attention
to
something
else
that
was
never
a
very
difficult
thing
to
do
but
evidently
her
mother
spoke
of
the
matter
later
for
next
time
philip
came
she
took
the
opportunity
when
they
were
alone
for
a
couple
of
minutes
to
refer
to
it
you
didnt
think
it
disagreeable
of
me
last
week
when
i
wouldnt
kiss
you
not
a
bit
he
laughed
its
not
because
i
wasnt
grateful
she
blushed
a
little
as
she
uttered
the
formal
phrase
which
she
had
prepared
i
shall
always
value
the
necklace
and
it
was
very
kind
of
you
to
give
it
me
philip
found
it
always
a
little
difficult
to
talk
to
her
she
did
all
that
she
had
to
do
very
competently
but
seemed
to
feel
no
need
of
conversation
yet
there
was
nothing
unsociable
in
her
one
sunday
afternoon
when
athelny
and
his
wife
had
gone
out
together
and
philip
treated
as
one
of
the
family
sat
reading
in
the
parlour
sally
came
in
and
sat
by
the
window
to
sew
the
girls
clothes
were
made
at
home
and
sally
could
not
afford
to
spend
sundays
in
idleness
philip
thought
she
wished
to
talk
and
put
down
his
book
go
on
reading
she
said
i
only
thought
as
you
were
alone
id
come
and
sit
with
you
youre
the
most
silent
person
ive
ever
struck
said
philip
we
dont
want
another
one
whos
talkative
in
this
house
she
said
there
was
no
irony
in
her
tone
she
was
merely
stating
a
fact
but
it
suggested
to
philip
that
she
measured
her
father
alas
no
longer
the
hero
he
was
to
her
childhood
and
in
her
mind
joined
together
his
entertaining
conversation
and
the
thriftlessness
which
often
brought
difficulties
into
their
life
she
compared
his
rhetoric
with
her
mothers
practical
common
sense
and
though
the
liveliness
of
her
father
amused
her
she
was
perhaps
sometimes
a
little
impatient
with
it
philip
looked
at
her
as
she
bent
over
her
work
she
was
healthy
strong
and
normal
it
must
be
odd
to
see
her
among
the
other
girls
in
the
shop
with
their
flat
chests
and
anaemic
faces
mildred
suffered
from
anaemia
after
a
time
it
appeared
that
sally
had
a
suitor
she
went
out
occasionally
with
friends
she
had
made
in
the
workroom
and
had
met
a
young
man
an
electrical
engineer
in
a
very
good
way
of
business
who
was
a
most
eligible
person
one
day
she
told
her
mother
that
he
had
asked
her
to
marry
him
what
did
you
say
said
her
mother
oh
i
told
him
i
wasnt
overanxious
to
marry
anyone
just
yet
awhile
she
paused
a
little
as
was
her
habit
between
observations
he
took
on
so
that
i
said
he
might
come
to
tea
on
sunday
it
was
an
occasion
that
thoroughly
appealed
to
athelny
he
rehearsed
all
the
afternoon
how
he
should
play
the
heavy
father
for
the
young
mans
edification
till
he
reduced
his
children
to
helpless
giggling
just
before
he
was
due
athelny
routed
out
an
egyptian
tarboosh
and
insisted
on
putting
it
on
go
on
with
you
athelny
said
his
wife
who
was
in
her
best
which
was
of
black
velvet
and
since
she
was
growing
stouter
every
year
very
tight
for
her
youll
spoil
the
girls
chances
she
tried
to
pull
it
off
but
the
little
man
skipped
nimbly
out
of
her
way
unhand
me
woman
nothing
will
induce
me
to
take
it
off
this
young
man
must
be
shown
at
once
that
it
is
no
ordinary
family
he
is
preparing
to
enter
let
him
keep
it
on
mother
said
sally
in
her
even
indifferent
fashion
if
mr
donaldson
doesnt
take
it
the
way
its
meant
he
can
take
himself
off
and
good
riddance
philip
thought
it
was
a
severe
ordeal
that
the
young
man
was
being
exposed
to
since
athelny
in
his
brown
velvet
jacket
flowing
black
tie
and
red
tarboosh
was
a
startling
spectacle
for
an
innocent
electrical
engineer
when
he
came
he
was
greeted
by
his
host
with
the
proud
courtesy
of
a
spanish
grandee
and
by
mrs
athelny
in
an
altogether
homely
and
natural
fashion
they
sat
down
at
the
old
ironingtable
in
the
highbacked
monkish
chairs
and
mrs
athelny
poured
tea
out
of
a
lustre
teapot
which
gave
a
note
of
england
and
the
countryside
to
the
festivity
she
had
made
little
cakes
with
her
own
hand
and
on
the
table
was
homemade
jam
it
was
a
farmhouse
tea
and
to
philip
very
quaint
and
charming
in
that
jacobean
house
athelny
for
some
fantastic
reason
took
it
into
his
head
to
discourse
upon
byzantine
history
he
had
been
reading
the
later
volumes
of
the
decline
and
fall
and
his
forefinger
dramatically
extended
he
poured
into
the
astonished
ears
of
the
suitor
scandalous
stories
about
theodora
and
irene
he
addressed
himself
directly
to
his
guest
with
a
torrent
of
rhodomontade
and
the
young
man
reduced
to
helpless
silence
and
shy
nodded
his
head
at
intervals
to
show
that
he
took
an
intelligent
interest
mrs
athelny
paid
no
attention
to
thorpes
conversation
but
interrupted
now
and
then
to
offer
the
young
man
more
tea
or
to
press
upon
him
cake
and
jam
philip
watched
sally
she
sat
with
downcast
eyes
calm
silent
and
observant
and
her
long
eyelashes
cast
a
pretty
shadow
on
her
cheek
you
could
not
tell
whether
she
was
amused
at
the
scene
or
if
she
cared
for
the
young
man
she
was
inscrutable
but
one
thing
was
certain
the
electrical
engineer
was
goodlooking
fair
and
cleanshaven
with
pleasant
regular
features
and
an
honest
face
he
was
tall
and
wellmade
philip
could
not
help
thinking
he
would
make
an
excellent
mate
for
her
and
he
felt
a
pang
of
envy
for
the
happiness
which
he
fancied
was
in
store
for
them
presently
the
suitor
said
he
thought
it
was
about
time
he
was
getting
along
sally
rose
to
her
feet
without
a
word
and
accompanied
him
to
the
door
when
she
came
back
her
father
burst
out
well
sally
we
think
your
young
man
very
nice
we
are
prepared
to
welcome
him
into
our
family
let
the
banns
be
called
and
i
will
compose
a
nuptial
song
sally
set
about
clearing
away
the
teathings
she
did
not
answer
suddenly
she
shot
a
swift
glance
at
philip
what
did
you
think
of
him
mr
philip
she
had
always
refused
to
call
him
uncle
phil
as
the
other
children
did
and
would
not
call
him
philip
i
think
youd
make
an
awfully
handsome
pair
she
looked
at
him
quickly
once
more
and
then
with
a
slight
blush
went
on
with
her
business
i
thought
him
a
very
nice
civilspoken
young
fellow
said
mrs
athelny
and
i
think
hes
just
the
sort
to
make
any
girl
happy
sally
did
not
reply
for
a
minute
or
two
and
philip
looked
at
her
curiously
it
might
be
thought
that
she
was
meditating
upon
what
her
mother
had
said
and
on
the
other
hand
she
might
be
thinking
of
the
man
in
the
moon
why
dont
you
answer
when
youre
spoken
to
sally
remarked
her
mother
a
little
irritably
i
thought
he
was
a
silly
arent
you
going
to
have
him
then
no
im
not
i
dont
know
how
much
more
you
want
said
mrs
athelny
and
it
was
quite
clear
now
that
she
was
put
out
hes
a
very
decent
young
fellow
and
he
can
afford
to
give
you
a
thorough
good
home
weve
got
quite
enough
to
feed
here
without
you
if
you
get
a
chance
like
that
its
wicked
not
to
take
it
and
i
daresay
youd
be
able
to
have
a
girl
to
do
the
rough
work
philip
had
never
before
heard
mrs
athelny
refer
so
directly
to
the
difficulties
of
her
life
he
saw
how
important
it
was
that
each
child
should
be
provided
for
its
no
good
your
carrying
on
mother
said
sally
in
her
quiet
way
im
not
going
to
marry
him
i
think
youre
a
very
hardhearted
cruel
selfish
girl
if
you
want
me
to
earn
my
own
living
mother
i
can
always
go
into
service
dont
be
so
silly
you
know
your
father
would
never
let
you
do
that
philip
caught
sallys
eye
and
he
thought
there
was
in
it
a
glimmer
of
amusement
he
wondered
what
there
had
been
in
the
conversation
to
touch
her
sense
of
humour
she
was
an
odd
girl
chapter
cxvi
during
his
last
year
at
st
lukes
philip
had
to
work
hard
he
was
contented
with
life
he
found
it
very
comfortable
to
be
heartfree
and
to
have
enough
money
for
his
needs
he
had
heard
people
speak
contemptuously
of
money
he
wondered
if
they
had
ever
tried
to
do
without
it
he
knew
that
the
lack
made
a
man
petty
mean
grasping
it
distorted
his
character
and
caused
him
to
view
the
world
from
a
vulgar
angle
when
you
had
to
consider
every
penny
money
became
of
grotesque
importance
you
needed
a
competency
to
rate
it
at
its
proper
value
he
lived
a
solitary
life
seeing
no
one
except
the
athelnys
but
he
was
not
lonely
he
busied
himself
with
plans
for
the
future
and
sometimes
he
thought
of
the
past
his
recollection
dwelt
now
and
then
on
old
friends
but
he
made
no
effort
to
see
them
he
would
have
liked
to
know
what
was
become
of
norah
nesbit
she
was
norah
something
else
now
but
he
could
not
remember
the
name
of
the
man
she
was
going
to
marry
he
was
glad
to
have
known
her
she
was
a
good
and
a
brave
soul
one
evening
about
half
past
eleven
he
saw
lawson
walking
along
piccadilly
he
was
in
evening
clothes
and
might
be
supposed
to
be
coming
back
from
a
theatre
philip
gave
way
to
a
sudden
impulse
and
quickly
turned
down
a
side
street
he
had
not
seen
him
for
two
years
and
felt
that
he
could
not
now
take
up
again
the
interrupted
friendship
he
and
lawson
had
nothing
more
to
say
to
one
another
philip
was
no
longer
interested
in
art
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
able
to
enjoy
beauty
with
greater
force
than
when
he
was
a
boy
but
art
appeared
to
him
unimportant
he
was
occupied
with
the
forming
of
a
pattern
out
of
the
manifold
chaos
of
life
and
the
materials
with
which
he
worked
seemed
to
make
preoccupation
with
pigments
and
words
very
trivial
lawson
had
served
his
turn
philips
friendship
with
him
had
been
a
motive
in
the
design
he
was
elaborating
it
was
merely
sentimental
to
ignore
the
fact
that
the
painter
was
of
no
further
interest
to
him
sometimes
philip
thought
of
mildred
he
avoided
deliberately
the
streets
in
which
there
was
a
chance
of
seeing
her
but
occasionally
some
feeling
perhaps
curiosity
perhaps
something
deeper
which
he
would
not
acknowledge
made
him
wander
about
piccadilly
and
regent
street
during
the
hours
when
she
might
be
expected
to
be
there
he
did
not
know
then
whether
he
wished
to
see
her
or
dreaded
it
once
he
saw
a
back
which
reminded
him
of
hers
and
for
a
moment
he
thought
it
was
she
it
gave
him
a
curious
sensation
it
was
a
strange
sharp
pain
in
his
heart
there
was
fear
in
it
and
a
sickening
dismay
and
when
he
hurried
on
and
found
that
he
was
mistaken
he
did
not
know
whether
it
was
relief
that
he
experienced
or
disappointment
at
the
beginning
of
august
philip
passed
his
surgery
his
last
examination
and
received
his
diploma
it
was
seven
years
since
he
had
entered
st
lukes
hospital
he
was
nearly
thirty
he
walked
down
the
stairs
of
the
royal
college
of
surgeons
with
the
roll
in
his
hand
which
qualified
him
to
practice
and
his
heart
beat
with
satisfaction
now
im
really
going
to
begin
life
he
thought
next
day
he
went
to
the
secretarys
office
to
put
his
name
down
for
one
of
the
hospital
appointments
the
secretary
was
a
pleasant
little
man
with
a
black
beard
whom
philip
had
always
found
very
affable
he
congratulated
him
on
his
success
and
then
said
i
suppose
you
wouldnt
like
to
do
a
locum
for
a
month
on
the
south
coast
three
guineas
a
week
with
board
and
lodging
i
wouldnt
mind
said
philip
its
at
farnley
in
dorsetshire
doctor
south
youd
have
to
go
down
at
once
his
assistant
has
developed
mumps
i
believe
its
a
very
pleasant
place
there
was
something
in
the
secretarys
manner
that
puzzled
philip
it
was
a
little
doubtful
whats
the
crab
in
it
he
asked
the
secretary
hesitated
a
moment
and
laughed
in
a
conciliating
fashion
well
the
fact
is
i
understand
hes
rather
a
crusty
funny
old
fellow
the
agencies
wont
send
him
anyone
any
more
he
speaks
his
mind
very
openly
and
men
dont
like
it
but
dyou
think
hell
be
satisfied
with
a
man
whos
only
just
qualified
after
all
i
have
no
experience
he
ought
to
be
glad
to
get
you
said
the
secretary
diplomatically
philip
thought
for
a
moment
he
had
nothing
to
do
for
the
next
few
weeks
and
he
was
glad
of
the
chance
to
earn
a
bit
of
money
he
could
put
it
aside
for
the
holiday
in
spain
which
he
had
promised
himself
when
he
had
finished
his
appointment
at
st
lukes
or
if
they
would
not
give
him
anything
there
at
some
other
hospital
all
right
ill
go
the
only
thing
is
you
must
go
this
afternoon
will
that
suit
you
if
so
ill
send
a
wire
at
once
philip
would
have
liked
a
few
days
to
himself
but
he
had
seen
the
athelnys
the
night
before
he
had
gone
at
once
to
take
them
his
good
news
and
there
was
really
no
reason
why
he
should
not
start
immediately
he
had
little
luggage
to
pack
soon
after
seven
that
evening
he
got
out
of
the
station
at
farnley
and
took
a
cab
to
doctor
souths
it
was
a
broad
low
stucco
house
with
a
virginia
creeper
growing
over
it
he
was
shown
into
the
consultingroom
an
old
man
was
writing
at
a
desk
he
looked
up
as
the
maid
ushered
philip
in
he
did
not
get
up
and
he
did
not
speak
he
merely
stared
at
philip
philip
was
taken
aback
i
think
youre
expecting
me
he
said
the
secretary
of
st
lukes
wired
to
you
this
morning
i
kept
dinner
back
for
half
an
hour
dyou
want
to
wash
i
do
said
philip
doctor
south
amused
him
by
his
odd
manner
he
got
up
now
and
philip
saw
that
he
was
a
man
of
middle
height
thin
with
white
hair
cut
very
short
and
a
long
mouth
closed
so
tightly
that
he
seemed
to
have
no
lips
at
all
he
was
cleanshaven
but
for
small
white
whiskers
and
they
increased
the
squareness
of
face
which
his
firm
jaw
gave
him
he
wore
a
brown
tweed
suit
and
a
white
stock
his
clothes
hung
loosely
about
him
as
though
they
had
been
made
for
a
much
larger
man
he
looked
like
a
respectable
farmer
of
the
middle
of
the
nineteenth
century
he
opened
the
door
there
is
the
diningroom
he
said
pointing
to
the
door
opposite
your
bedroom
is
the
first
door
you
come
to
when
you
get
on
the
landing
come
downstairs
when
youre
ready
during
dinner
philip
knew
that
doctor
south
was
examining
him
but
he
spoke
little
and
philip
felt
that
he
did
not
want
to
hear
his
assistant
talk
when
were
you
qualified
he
asked
suddenly
yesterday
were
you
at
a
university
no
last
year
when
my
assistant
took
a
holiday
they
sent
me
a
varsity
man
i
told
em
not
to
do
it
again
too
damned
gentlemanly
for
me
there
was
another
pause
the
dinner
was
very
simple
and
very
good
philip
preserved
a
sedate
exterior
but
in
his
heart
he
was
bubbling
over
with
excitement
he
was
immensely
elated
at
being
engaged
as
a
locum
it
made
him
feel
extremely
grown
up
he
had
an
insane
desire
to
laugh
at
nothing
in
particular
and
the
more
he
thought
of
his
professional
dignity
the
more
he
was
inclined
to
chuckle
but
doctor
south
broke
suddenly
into
his
thoughts
how
old
are
you
getting
on
for
thirty
how
is
it
youre
only
just
qualified
i
didnt
go
in
for
the
medical
till
i
was
nearly
twentythree
and
i
had
to
give
it
up
for
two
years
in
the
middle
why
poverty
doctor
south
gave
him
an
odd
look
and
relapsed
into
silence
at
the
end
of
dinner
he
got
up
from
the
table
dyou
know
what
sort
of
a
practice
this
is
no
answered
philip
mostly
fishermen
and
their
families
i
have
the
union
and
the
seamens
hospital
i
used
to
be
alone
here
but
since
they
tried
to
make
this
into
a
fashionable
seaside
resort
a
man
has
set
up
on
the
cliff
and
the
welltodo
people
go
to
him
i
only
have
those
who
cant
afford
to
pay
for
a
doctor
at
all
philip
saw
that
the
rivalry
was
a
sore
point
with
the
old
man
you
know
that
i
have
no
experience
said
philip
you
none
of
you
know
anything
he
walked
out
of
the
room
without
another
word
and
left
philip
by
himself
when
the
maid
came
in
to
clear
away
she
told
philip
that
doctor
south
saw
patients
from
six
till
seven
work
for
that
night
was
over
philip
fetched
a
book
from
his
room
lit
his
pipe
and
settled
himself
down
to
read
it
was
a
great
comfort
since
he
had
read
nothing
but
medical
books
for
the
last
few
months
at
ten
oclock
doctor
south
came
in
and
looked
at
him
philip
hated
not
to
have
his
feet
up
and
he
had
dragged
up
a
chair
for
them
you
seem
able
to
make
yourself
pretty
comfortable
said
doctor
south
with
a
grimness
which
would
have
disturbed
philip
if
he
had
not
been
in
such
high
spirits
philips
eyes
twinkled
as
he
answered
have
you
any
objection
doctor
south
gave
him
a
look
but
did
not
reply
directly
whats
that
youre
reading
peregrine
pickle
smollett
i
happen
to
know
that
smollett
wrote
peregrine
pickle
i
beg
your
pardon
medical
men
arent
much
interested
in
literature
are
they
philip
had
put
the
book
down
on
the
table
and
doctor
south
took
it
up
it
was
a
volume
of
an
edition
which
had
belonged
to
the
vicar
of
blackstable
it
was
a
thin
book
bound
in
faded
morocco
with
a
copperplate
engraving
as
a
frontispiece
the
pages
were
musty
with
age
and
stained
with
mould
philip
without
meaning
to
started
forward
a
little
as
doctor
south
took
the
volume
in
his
hands
and
a
slight
smile
came
into
his
eyes
very
little
escaped
the
old
doctor
do
i
amuse
you
he
asked
icily
i
see
youre
fond
of
books
you
can
always
tell
by
the
way
people
handle
them
doctor
south
put
down
the
novel
immediately
breakfast
at
eightthirty
he
said
and
left
the
room
what
a
funny
old
fellow
thought
philip
he
soon
discovered
why
doctor
souths
assistants
found
it
difficult
to
get
on
with
him
in
the
first
place
he
set
his
face
firmly
against
all
the
discoveries
of
the
last
thirty
years
he
had
no
patience
with
the
drugs
which
became
modish
were
thought
to
work
marvellous
cures
and
in
a
few
years
were
discarded
he
had
stock
mixtures
which
he
had
brought
from
st
lukes
where
he
had
been
a
student
and
had
used
all
his
life
he
found
them
just
as
efficacious
as
anything
that
had
come
into
fashion
since
philip
was
startled
at
doctor
souths
suspicion
of
asepsis
he
had
accepted
it
in
deference
to
universal
opinion
but
he
used
the
precautions
which
philip
had
known
insisted
upon
so
scrupulously
at
the
hospital
with
the
disdainful
tolerance
of
a
man
playing
at
soldiers
with
children
ive
seen
antiseptics
come
along
and
sweep
everything
before
them
and
then
ive
seen
asepsis
take
their
place
bunkum
the
young
men
who
were
sent
down
to
him
knew
only
hospital
practice
and
they
came
with
the
unconcealed
scorn
for
the
general
practitioner
which
they
had
absorbed
in
the
air
at
the
hospital
but
they
had
seen
only
the
complicated
cases
which
appeared
in
the
wards
they
knew
how
to
treat
an
obscure
disease
of
the
suprarenal
bodies
but
were
helpless
when
consulted
for
a
cold
in
the
head
their
knowledge
was
theoretical
and
their
selfassurance
unbounded
doctor
south
watched
them
with
tightened
lips
he
took
a
savage
pleasure
in
showing
them
how
great
was
their
ignorance
and
how
unjustified
their
conceit
it
was
a
poor
practice
of
fishing
folk
and
the
doctor
made
up
his
own
prescriptions
doctor
south
asked
his
assistant
how
he
expected
to
make
both
ends
meet
if
he
gave
a
fisherman
with
a
stomachache
a
mixture
consisting
of
half
a
dozen
expensive
drugs
he
complained
too
that
the
young
medical
men
were
uneducated
their
reading
consisted
of
the
sporting
times
and
the
british
medical
journal
they
could
neither
write
a
legible
hand
nor
spell
correctly
for
two
or
three
days
doctor
south
watched
philip
closely
ready
to
fall
on
him
with
acid
sarcasm
if
he
gave
him
the
opportunity
and
philip
aware
of
this
went
about
his
work
with
a
quiet
sense
of
amusement
he
was
pleased
with
the
change
of
occupation
he
liked
the
feeling
of
independence
and
of
responsibility
all
sorts
of
people
came
to
the
consultingroom
he
was
gratified
because
he
seemed
able
to
inspire
his
patients
with
confidence
and
it
was
entertaining
to
watch
the
process
of
cure
which
at
a
hospital
necessarily
could
be
watched
only
at
distant
intervals
his
rounds
took
him
into
lowroofed
cottages
in
which
were
fishing
tackle
and
sails
and
here
and
there
mementoes
of
deepsea
travelling
a
lacquer
box
from
japan
spears
and
oars
from
melanesia
or
daggers
from
the
bazaars
of
stamboul
there
was
an
air
of
romance
in
the
stuffy
little
rooms
and
the
salt
of
the
sea
gave
them
a
bitter
freshness
philip
liked
to
talk
to
the
sailormen
and
when
they
found
that
he
was
not
supercilious
they
told
him
long
yarns
of
the
distant
journeys
of
their
youth
once
or
twice
he
made
a
mistake
in
diagnosis
he
had
never
seen
a
case
of
measles
before
and
when
he
was
confronted
with
the
rash
took
it
for
an
obscure
disease
of
the
skin
and
once
or
twice
his
ideas
of
treatment
differed
from
doctor
souths
the
first
time
this
happened
doctor
south
attacked
him
with
savage
irony
but
philip
took
it
with
good
humour
he
had
some
gift
for
repartee
and
he
made
one
or
two
answers
which
caused
doctor
south
to
stop
and
look
at
him
curiously
philips
face
was
grave
but
his
eyes
were
twinkling
the
old
gentleman
could
not
avoid
the
impression
that
philip
was
chaffing
him
he
was
used
to
being
disliked
and
feared
by
his
assistants
and
this
was
a
new
experience
he
had
half
a
mind
to
fly
into
a
passion
and
pack
philip
off
by
the
next
train
he
had
done
that
before
with
his
assistants
but
he
had
an
uneasy
feeling
that
philip
then
would
simply
laugh
at
him
outright
and
suddenly
he
felt
amused
his
mouth
formed
itself
into
a
smile
against
his
will
and
he
turned
away
in
a
little
while
he
grew
conscious
that
philip
was
amusing
himself
systematically
at
his
expense
he
was
taken
aback
at
first
and
then
diverted
damn
his
impudence
he
chuckled
to
himself
damn
his
impudence
chapter
cxvii
philip
had
written
to
athelny
to
tell
him
that
he
was
doing
a
locum
in
dorsetshire
and
in
due
course
received
an
answer
from
him
it
was
written
in
the
formal
manner
he
affected
studded
with
pompous
epithets
as
a
persian
diadem
was
studded
with
precious
stones
and
in
the
beautiful
hand
like
black
letter
and
as
difficult
to
read
upon
which
he
prided
himself
he
suggested
that
philip
should
join
him
and
his
family
in
the
kentish
hopfield
to
which
he
went
every
year
and
to
persuade
him
said
various
beautiful
and
complicated
things
about
philips
soul
and
the
winding
tendrils
of
the
hops
philip
replied
at
once
that
he
would
come
on
the
first
day
he
was
free
though
not
born
there
he
had
a
peculiar
affection
for
the
isle
of
thanet
and
he
was
fired
with
enthusiasm
at
the
thought
of
spending
a
fortnight
so
close
to
the
earth
and
amid
conditions
which
needed
only
a
blue
sky
to
be
as
idyllic
as
the
olive
groves
of
arcady
the
four
weeks
of
his
engagement
at
farnley
passed
quickly
on
the
cliff
a
new
town
was
springing
up
with
red
brick
villas
round
golf
links
and
a
large
hotel
had
recently
been
opened
to
cater
for
the
summer
visitors
but
philip
went
there
seldom
down
below
by
the
harbour
the
little
stone
houses
of
a
past
century
were
clustered
in
a
delightful
confusion
and
the
narrow
streets
climbing
down
steeply
had
an
air
of
antiquity
which
appealed
to
the
imagination
by
the
waters
edge
were
neat
cottages
with
trim
tiny
gardens
in
front
of
them
they
were
inhabited
by
retired
captains
in
the
merchant
service
and
by
mothers
or
widows
of
men
who
had
gained
their
living
by
the
sea
and
they
had
an
appearance
which
was
quaint
and
peaceful
in
the
little
harbour
came
tramps
from
spain
and
the
levant
ships
of
small
tonnage
and
now
and
then
a
windjammer
was
borne
in
by
the
winds
of
romance
it
reminded
philip
of
the
dirty
little
harbour
with
its
colliers
at
blackstable
and
he
thought
that
there
he
had
first
acquired
the
desire
which
was
now
an
obsession
for
eastern
lands
and
sunlit
islands
in
a
tropic
sea
but
here
you
felt
yourself
closer
to
the
wide
deep
ocean
than
on
the
shore
of
that
north
sea
which
seemed
always
circumscribed
here
you
could
draw
a
long
breath
as
you
looked
out
upon
the
even
vastness
and
the
west
wind
the
dear
soft
salt
wind
of
england
uplifted
the
heart
and
at
the
same
time
melted
it
to
tenderness
one
evening
when
philip
had
reached
his
last
week
with
doctor
south
a
child
came
to
the
surgery
door
while
the
old
doctor
and
philip
were
making
up
prescriptions
it
was
a
little
ragged
girl
with
a
dirty
face
and
bare
feet
philip
opened
the
door
please
sir
will
you
come
to
mrs
fletchers
in
ivy
lane
at
once
whats
the
matter
with
mrs
fletcher
called
out
doctor
south
in
his
rasping
voice
the
child
took
no
notice
of
him
but
addressed
herself
again
to
philip
please
sir
her
little
boys
had
an
accident
and
will
you
come
at
once
tell
mrs
fletcher
im
coming
called
out
doctor
south
the
little
girl
hesitated
for
a
moment
and
putting
a
dirty
finger
in
a
dirty
mouth
stood
still
and
looked
at
philip
whats
the
matter
kid
said
philip
smiling
please
sir
mrs
fletcher
says
will
the
new
doctor
come
there
was
a
sound
in
the
dispensary
and
doctor
south
came
out
into
the
passage
isnt
mrs
fletcher
satisfied
with
me
he
barked
ive
attended
mrs
fletcher
since
she
was
born
why
arent
i
good
enough
to
attend
her
filthy
brat
the
little
girl
looked
for
a
moment
as
though
she
were
going
to
cry
then
she
thought
better
of
it
she
put
out
her
tongue
deliberately
at
doctor
south
and
before
he
could
recover
from
his
astonishment
bolted
off
as
fast
as
she
could
run
philip
saw
that
the
old
gentleman
was
annoyed
you
look
rather
fagged
and
its
a
goodish
way
to
ivy
lane
he
said
by
way
of
giving
him
an
excuse
not
to
go
himself
doctor
south
gave
a
low
snarl
its
a
damned
sight
nearer
for
a
man
whos
got
the
use
of
both
legs
than
for
a
man
whos
only
got
one
and
a
half
philip
reddened
and
stood
silent
for
a
while
do
you
wish
me
to
go
or
will
you
go
yourself
he
said
at
last
frigidly
whats
the
good
of
my
going
they
want
you
philip
took
up
his
hat
and
went
to
see
the
patient
it
was
hard
upon
eight
oclock
when
he
came
back
doctor
south
was
standing
in
the
diningroom
with
his
back
to
the
fireplace
youve
been
a
long
time
he
said
im
sorry
why
didnt
you
start
dinner
because
i
chose
to
wait
have
you
been
all
this
while
at
mrs
fletchers
no
im
afraid
i
havent
i
stopped
to
look
at
the
sunset
on
my
way
back
and
i
didnt
think
of
the
time
doctor
south
did
not
reply
and
the
servant
brought
in
some
grilled
sprats
philip
ate
them
with
an
excellent
appetite
suddenly
doctor
south
shot
a
question
at
him
why
did
you
look
at
the
sunset
philip
answered
with
his
mouth
full
because
i
was
happy
doctor
south
gave
him
an
odd
look
and
the
shadow
of
a
smile
flickered
across
his
old
tired
face
they
ate
the
rest
of
the
dinner
in
silence
but
when
the
maid
had
given
them
the
port
and
left
the
room
the
old
man
leaned
back
and
fixed
his
sharp
eyes
on
philip
it
stung
you
up
a
bit
when
i
spoke
of
your
game
leg
young
fellow
he
said
people
always
do
directly
or
indirectly
when
they
get
angry
with
me
i
suppose
they
know
its
your
weak
point
philip
faced
him
and
looked
at
him
steadily
are
you
very
glad
to
have
discovered
it
the
doctor
did
not
answer
but
he
gave
a
chuckle
of
bitter
mirth
they
sat
for
a
while
staring
at
one
another
then
doctor
south
surprised
philip
extremely
why
dont
you
stay
here
and
ill
get
rid
of
that
damned
fool
with
his
mumps
its
very
kind
of
you
but
i
hope
to
get
an
appointment
at
the
hospital
in
the
autumn
itll
help
me
so
much
in
getting
other
work
later
im
offering
you
a
partnership
said
doctor
south
grumpily
why
asked
philip
with
surprise
they
seem
to
like
you
down
here
i
didnt
think
that
was
a
fact
which
altogether
met
with
your
approval
philip
said
drily
dyou
suppose
that
after
forty
years
practice
i
care
a
twopenny
damn
whether
people
prefer
my
assistant
to
me
no
my
friend
theres
no
sentiment
between
my
patients
and
me
i
dont
expect
gratitude
from
them
i
expect
them
to
pay
my
fees
well
what
dyou
say
to
it
philip
made
no
reply
not
because
he
was
thinking
over
the
proposal
but
because
he
was
astonished
it
was
evidently
very
unusual
for
someone
to
offer
a
partnership
to
a
newly
qualified
man
and
he
realised
with
wonder
that
although
nothing
would
induce
him
to
say
so
doctor
south
had
taken
a
fancy
to
him
he
thought
how
amused
the
secretary
at
st
lukes
would
be
when
he
told
him
the
practice
brings
in
about
seven
hundred
a
year
we
can
reckon
out
how
much
your
share
would
be
worth
and
you
can
pay
me
off
by
degrees
and
when
i
die
you
can
succeed
me
i
think
thats
better
than
knocking
about
hospitals
for
two
or
three
years
and
then
taking
assistantships
until
you
can
afford
to
set
up
for
yourself
philip
knew
it
was
a
chance
that
most
people
in
his
profession
would
jump
at
the
profession
was
overcrowded
and
half
the
men
he
knew
would
be
thankful
to
accept
the
certainty
of
even
so
modest
a
competence
as
that
im
awfully
sorry
but
i
cant
he
said
it
means
giving
up
everything
ive
aimed
at
for
years
in
one
way
and
another
ive
had
a
roughish
time
but
i
always
had
that
one
hope
before
me
to
get
qualified
so
that
i
might
travel
and
now
when
i
wake
in
the
morning
my
bones
simply
ache
to
get
off
i
dont
mind
where
particularly
but
just
away
to
places
ive
never
been
to
now
the
goal
seemed
very
near
he
would
have
finished
his
appointment
at
st
lukes
by
the
middle
of
the
following
year
and
then
he
would
go
to
spain
he
could
afford
to
spend
several
months
there
rambling
up
and
down
the
land
which
stood
to
him
for
romance
after
that
he
would
get
a
ship
and
go
to
the
east
life
was
before
him
and
time
of
no
account
he
could
wander
for
years
if
he
chose
in
unfrequented
places
amid
strange
peoples
where
life
was
led
in
strange
ways
he
did
not
know
what
he
sought
or
what
his
journeys
would
bring
him
but
he
had
a
feeling
that
he
would
learn
something
new
about
life
and
gain
some
clue
to
the
mystery
that
he
had
solved
only
to
find
more
mysterious
and
even
if
he
found
nothing
he
would
allay
the
unrest
which
gnawed
at
his
heart
but
doctor
south
was
showing
him
a
great
kindness
and
it
seemed
ungrateful
to
refuse
his
offer
for
no
adequate
reason
so
in
his
shy
way
trying
to
appear
as
matter
of
fact
as
possible
he
made
some
attempt
to
explain
why
it
was
so
important
to
him
to
carry
out
the
plans
he
had
cherished
so
passionately
doctor
south
listened
quietly
and
a
gentle
look
came
into
his
shrewd
old
eyes
it
seemed
to
philip
an
added
kindness
that
he
did
not
press
him
to
accept
his
offer
benevolence
is
often
very
peremptory
he
appeared
to
look
upon
philips
reasons
as
sound
dropping
the
subject
he
began
to
talk
of
his
own
youth
he
had
been
in
the
royal
navy
and
it
was
his
long
connection
with
the
sea
that
when
he
retired
had
made
him
settle
at
farnley
he
told
philip
of
old
days
in
the
pacific
and
of
wild
adventures
in
china
he
had
taken
part
in
an
expedition
against
the
headhunters
of
borneo
and
had
known
samoa
when
it
was
still
an
independent
state
he
had
touched
at
coral
islands
philip
listened
to
him
entranced
little
by
little
he
told
philip
about
himself
doctor
south
was
a
widower
his
wife
had
died
thirty
years
before
and
his
daughter
had
married
a
farmer
in
rhodesia
he
had
quarrelled
with
him
and
she
had
not
come
to
england
for
ten
years
it
was
just
as
if
he
had
never
had
wife
or
child
he
was
very
lonely
his
gruffness
was
little
more
than
a
protection
which
he
wore
to
hide
a
complete
disillusionment
and
to
philip
it
seemed
tragic
to
see
him
just
waiting
for
death
not
impatiently
but
rather
with
loathing
for
it
hating
old
age
and
unable
to
resign
himself
to
its
limitations
and
yet
with
the
feeling
that
death
was
the
only
solution
of
the
bitterness
of
his
life
philip
crossed
his
path
and
the
natural
affection
which
long
separation
from
his
daughter
had
killedshe
had
taken
her
husbands
part
in
the
quarrel
and
her
children
he
had
never
seensettled
itself
upon
philip
at
first
it
made
him
angry
he
told
himself
it
was
a
sign
of
dotage
but
there
was
something
in
philip
that
attracted
him
and
he
found
himself
smiling
at
him
he
knew
not
why
philip
did
not
bore
him
once
or
twice
he
put
his
hand
on
his
shoulder
it
was
as
near
a
caress
as
he
had
got
since
his
daughter
left
england
so
many
years
before
when
the
time
came
for
philip
to
go
doctor
south
accompanied
him
to
the
station
he
found
himself
unaccountably
depressed
ive
had
a
ripping
time
here
said
philip
youve
been
awfully
kind
to
me
i
suppose
youre
very
glad
to
go
ive
enjoyed
myself
here
but
you
want
to
get
out
into
the
world
ah
you
have
youth
he
hesitated
a
moment
i
want
you
to
remember
that
if
you
change
your
mind
my
offer
still
stands
thats
awfully
kind
of
you
philip
shook
hands
with
him
out
of
the
carriage
window
and
the
train
steamed
out
of
the
station
philip
thought
of
the
fortnight
he
was
going
to
spend
in
the
hopfield
he
was
happy
at
the
idea
of
seeing
his
friends
again
and
he
rejoiced
because
the
day
was
fine
but
doctor
south
walked
slowly
back
to
his
empty
house
he
felt
very
old
and
very
lonely
chapter
cxviii
it
was
late
in
the
evening
when
philip
arrived
at
ferne
it
was
mrs
athelnys
native
village
and
she
had
been
accustomed
from
her
childhood
to
pick
in
the
hopfield
to
which
with
her
husband
and
her
children
she
still
went
every
year
like
many
kentish
folk
her
family
had
gone
out
regularly
glad
to
earn
a
little
money
but
especially
regarding
the
annual
outing
looked
forward
to
for
months
as
the
best
of
holidays
the
work
was
not
hard
it
was
done
in
common
in
the
open
air
and
for
the
children
it
was
a
long
delightful
picnic
here
the
young
men
met
the
maidens
in
the
long
evenings
when
work
was
over
they
wandered
about
the
lanes
making
love
and
the
hopping
season
was
generally
followed
by
weddings
they
went
out
in
carts
with
bedding
pots
and
pans
chairs
and
tables
and
ferne
while
the
hopping
lasted
was
deserted
they
were
very
exclusive
and
would
have
resented
the
intrusion
of
foreigners
as
they
called
the
people
who
came
from
london
they
looked
down
upon
them
and
feared
them
too
they
were
a
rough
lot
and
the
respectable
country
folk
did
not
want
to
mix
with
them
in
the
old
days
the
hoppers
slept
in
barns
but
ten
years
ago
a
row
of
huts
had
been
erected
at
the
side
of
a
meadow
and
the
athelnys
like
many
others
had
the
same
hut
every
year
athelny
met
philip
at
the
station
in
a
cart
he
had
borrowed
from
the
publichouse
at
which
he
had
got
a
room
for
philip
it
was
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
hopfield
they
left
his
bag
there
and
walked
over
to
the
meadow
in
which
were
the
huts
they
were
nothing
more
than
a
long
low
shed
divided
into
little
rooms
about
twelve
feet
square
in
front
of
each
was
a
fire
of
sticks
round
which
a
family
was
grouped
eagerly
watching
the
cooking
of
supper
the
seaair
and
the
sun
had
browned
already
the
faces
of
athelnys
children
mrs
athelny
seemed
a
different
woman
in
her
sunbonnet
you
felt
that
the
long
years
in
the
city
had
made
no
real
difference
to
her
she
was
the
country
woman
born
and
bred
and
you
could
see
how
much
at
home
she
found
herself
in
the
country
she
was
frying
bacon
and
at
the
same
time
keeping
an
eye
on
the
younger
children
but
she
had
a
hearty
handshake
and
a
jolly
smile
for
philip
athelny
was
enthusiastic
over
the
delights
of
a
rural
existence
were
starved
for
sun
and
light
in
the
cities
we
live
in
it
isnt
life
its
a
long
imprisonment
let
us
sell
all
we
have
betty
and
take
a
farm
in
the
country
i
can
see
you
in
the
country
she
answered
with
goodhumoured
scorn
why
the
first
rainy
day
we
had
in
the
winter
youd
be
crying
for
london
she
turned
to
philip
athelnys
always
like
this
when
we
come
down
here
country
i
like
that
why
he
dont
know
a
swede
from
a
mangelwurzel
daddy

lazy
today
remarked
jane
with
the
frankness
which
characterized
her
he
didnt
fill
one
bin
im
getting
into
practice
child
and
tomorrow
i
shall
fill
more
bins
than
all
of

together

and
eat
your
supper
children
said
mrs
athelny
wheres
sally
here
i
am
mother
she
stepped
out
of
their
little
hut
and
the
flames
of
the
wood
fire
leaped
up
and
cast
sharp
colour
upon
her
face
of
late
philip
had
only
seen
her
in
the
trim
frocks
she
had
taken
to
since
she
was
at
the
dressmakers
and
there
was
something
very
charming
in
the
print
dress
she
wore
now
loose
and
easy
to
work
in
the
sleeves
were
tucked
up
and
showed
her
strong
round
arms
she
too
had
a
sunbonnet
you
look
like
a
milkmaid
in
a
fairy
story
said
philip
as
he
shook
hands
with
her
shes
the
belle
of
the
hopfields
said
athelny
my
word
if
the
squires
son
sees
you
hell
make
you
an
offer
of
marriage
before
you
can
say
jack
robinson
the
squire
hasnt
got
a
son
father
said
sally
she
looked
about
for
a
place
to
sit
down
in
and
philip
made
room
for
her
beside
him
she
looked
wonderful
in
the
night
lit
by
wood
fires
she
was
like
some
rural
goddess
and
you
thought
of
those
fresh
strong
girls
whom
old
herrick
had
praised
in
exquisite
numbers
the
supper
was
simple
bread
and
butter
crisp
bacon
tea
for
the
children
and
beer
for
mr
and
mrs
athelny
and
philip
athelny
eating
hungrily
praised
loudly
all
he
ate
he
flung
words
of
scorn
at
lucullus
and
piled
invectives
upon
brillatsavarin
theres
one
thing
one
can
say
for
you
athelny
said
his
wife
you
do
enjoy
your
food
and
no
mistake
cooked
by
your
hand
my
betty
he
said
stretching
out
an
eloquent
forefinger
philip
felt
himself
very
comfortable
he
looked
happily
at
the
line
of
fires
with
people
grouped
about
them
and
the
colour
of
the
flames
against
the
night
at
the
end
of
the
meadow
was
a
line
of
great
elms
and
above
the
starry
sky
the
children
talked
and
laughed
and
athelny
a
child
among
them
made
them
roar
by
his
tricks
and
fancies
they
think
a
rare
lot
of
athelny
down
here
said
his
wife
why
mrs
bridges
said
to
me
i
dont
know
what
we
should
do
without
mr
athelny
now
she
said
hes
always
up
to
something
hes
more
like
a
schoolboy
than
the
father
of
a
family
sally
sat
in
silence
but
she
attended
to
philips
wants
in
a
thoughtful
fashion
that
charmed
him
it
was
pleasant
to
have
her
beside
him
and
now
and
then
he
glanced
at
her
sunburned
healthy
face
once
he
caught
her
eyes
and
she
smiled
quietly
when
supper
was
over
jane
and
a
small
brother
were
sent
down
to
a
brook
that
ran
at
the
bottom
of
the
meadow
to
fetch
a
pail
of
water
for
washing
up
you
children
show
your
uncle
philip
where
we
sleep
and
then
you
must
be
thinking
of
going
to
bed
small
hands
seized
philip
and
he
was
dragged
towards
the
hut
he
went
in
and
struck
a
match
there
was
no
furniture
in
it
and
beside
a
tin
box
in
which
clothes
were
kept
there
was
nothing
but
the
beds
there
were
three
of
them
one
against
each
wall
athelny
followed
philip
in
and
showed
them
proudly
thats
the
stuff
to
sleep
on
he
cried
none
of
your
springmattresses
and
swansdown
i
never
sleep
so
soundly
anywhere
as
here
you
will
sleep
between
sheets
my
dear
fellow
i
pity
you
from
the
bottom
of
my
soul
the
beds
consisted
of
a
thick
layer
of
hopvine
on
the
top
of
which
was
a
coating
of
straw
and
this
was
covered
with
a
blanket
after
a
day
in
the
open
air
with
the
aromatic
scent
of
the
hops
all
round
them
the
happy
pickers
slept
like
tops
by
nine
oclock
all
was
quiet
in
the
meadow
and
everyone
in
bed
but
one
or
two
men
who
still
lingered
in
the
publichouse
and
would
not
come
back
till
it
was
closed
at
ten
athelny
walked
there
with
philip
but
before
he
went
mrs
athelny
said
to
him
we
breakfast
about
a
quarter
to
six
but
i
daresay
you
wont
want
to
get
up
as
early
as
that
you
see
we
have
to
set
to
work
at
six
of
course
he
must
get
up
early
cried
athelny
and
he
must
work
like
the
rest
of
us
hes
got
to
earn
his
board
no
work
no
dinner
my
lad
the
children
go
down
to
bathe
before
breakfast
and
they
can
give
you
a
call
on
their
way
back
they
pass
the
jolly
sailor
if
theyll
wake
me
ill
come
and
bathe
with
them
said
philip
jane
and
harold
and
edward
shouted
with
delight
at
the
prospect
and
next
morning
philip
was
awakened
out
of
a
sound
sleep
by
their
bursting
into
his
room
the
boys
jumped
on
his
bed
and
he
had
to
chase
them
out
with
his
slippers
he
put
on
a
coat
and
a
pair
of
trousers
and
went
down
the
day
had
only
just
broken
and
there
was
a
nip
in
the
air
but
the
sky
was
cloudless
and
the
sun
was
shining
yellow
sally
holding
connies
hand
was
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
road
with
a
towel
and
a
bathingdress
over
her
arm
he
saw
now
that
her
sunbonnet
was
of
the
colour
of
lavender
and
against
it
her
face
red
and
brown
was
like
an
apple
she
greeted
him
with
her
slow
sweet
smile
and
he
noticed
suddenly
that
her
teeth
were
small
and
regular
and
very
white
he
wondered
why
they
had
never
caught
his
attention
before
i
was
for
letting
you
sleep
on
she
said
but
they
would
go
up
and
wake
you
i
said
you
didnt
really
want
to
come
oh
yes
i
did
they
walked
down
the
road
and
then
cut
across
the
marshes
that
way
it
was
under
a
mile
to
the
sea
the
water
looked
cold
and
gray
and
philip
shivered
at
the
sight
of
it
but
the
others
tore
off
their
clothes
and
ran
in
shouting
sally
did
everything
a
little
slowly
and
she
did
not
come
into
the
water
till
all
the
rest
were
splashing
round
philip
swimming
was
his
only
accomplishment
he
felt
at
home
in
the
water
and
soon
he
had
them
all
imitating
him
as
he
played
at
being
a
porpoise
and
a
drowning
man
and
a
fat
lady
afraid
of
wetting
her
hair
the
bathe
was
uproarious
and
it
was
necessary
for
sally
to
be
very
severe
to
induce
them
all
to
come
out
youre
as
bad
as
any
of
them
she
said
to
philip
in
her
grave
maternal
way
which
was
at
once
comic
and
touching
theyre
not
anything
like
so
naughty
when
youre
not
here
they
walked
back
sally
with
her
bright
hair
streaming
over
one
shoulder
and
her
sunbonnet
in
her
hand
but
when
they
got
to
the
huts
mrs
athelny
had
already
started
for
the
hopgarden
athleny
in
a
pair
of
the
oldest
trousers
anyone
had
ever
worn
his
jacket
buttoned
up
to
show
he
had
no
shirt
on
and
in
a
widebrimmed
soft
hat
was
frying
kippers
over
a
fire
of
sticks
he
was
delighted
with
himself
he
looked
every
inch
a
brigand
as
soon
as
he
saw
the
party
he
began
to
shout
the
witches
chorus
from
macbeth
over
the
odorous
kippers
you
mustnt
dawdle
over
your
breakfast
or
mother
will
be
angry
he
said
when
they
came
up
and
in
a
few
minutes
harold
and
jane
with
pieces
of
bread
and
butter
in
their
hands
they
sauntered
through
the
meadow
into
the
hopfield
they
were
the
last
to
leave
a
hopgarden
was
one
of
the
sights
connected
with
philips
boyhood
and
the
oasthouses
to
him
the
most
typical
feature
of
the
kentish
scene
it
was
with
no
sense
of
strangeness
but
as
though
he
were
at
home
that
philip
followed
sally
through
the
long
lines
of
the
hops
the
sun
was
bright
now
and
cast
a
sharp
shadow
philip
feasted
his
eyes
on
the
richness
of
the
green
leaves
the
hops
were
yellowing
and
to
him
they
had
the
beauty
and
the
passion
which
poets
in
sicily
have
found
in
the
purple
grape
as
they
walked
along
philip
felt
himself
overwhelmed
by
the
rich
luxuriance
a
sweet
scent
arose
from
the
fat
kentish
soil
and
the
fitful
september
breeze
was
heavy
with
the
goodly
perfume
of
the
hops
athelstan
felt
the
exhilaration
instinctively
for
he
lifted
up
his
voice
and
sang
it
was
the
cracked
voice
of
the
boy
of
fifteen
and
sally
turned
round
you
be
quiet
athelstan
or
we
shall
have
a
thunderstorm
in
a
moment
they
heard
the
hum
of
voices
and
in
a
moment
more
came
upon
the
pickers
they
were
all
hard
at
work
talking
and
laughing
as
they
picked
they
sat
on
chairs
on
stools
on
boxes
with
their
baskets
by
their
sides
and
some
stood
by
the
bin
throwing
the
hops
they
picked
straight
into
it
there
were
a
lot
of
children
about
and
a
good
many
babies
some
in
makeshift
cradles
some
tucked
up
in
a
rug
on
the
soft
brown
dry
earth
the
children
picked
a
little
and
played
a
great
deal
the
women
worked
busily
they
had
been
pickers
from
childhood
and
they
could
pick
twice
as
fast
as
foreigners
from
london
they
boasted
about
the
number
of
bushels
they
had
picked
in
a
day
but
they
complained
you
could
not
make
money
now
as
in
former
times
then
they
paid
you
a
shilling
for
five
bushels
but
now
the
rate
was
eight
and
even
nine
bushels
to
the
shilling
in
the
old
days
a
good
picker
could
earn
enough
in
the
season
to
keep
her
for
the
rest
of
the
year
but
now
there
was
nothing
in
it
you
got
a
holiday
for
nothing
and
that
was
about
all
mrs
hill
had
bought
herself
a
pianner
out
of
what
she
made
picking
so
she
said
but
she
was
very
near
one
wouldnt
like
to
be
near
like
that
and
most
people
thought
it
was
only
what
she
said
if
the
truth
was
known
perhaps
it
would
be
found
that
she
had
put
a
bit
of
money
from
the
savings
bank
towards
it
the
hoppers
were
divided
into
bin
companies
of
ten
pickers
not
counting
children
and
athelny
loudly
boasted
of
the
day
when
he
would
have
a
company
consisting
entirely
of
his
own
family
each
company
had
a
binman
whose
duty
it
was
to
supply
it
with
strings
of
hops
at
their
bins
the
bin
was
a
large
sack
on
a
wooden
frame
about
seven
feet
high
and
long
rows
of
them
were
placed
between
the
rows
of
hops
and
it
was
to
this
position
that
athelny
aspired
when
his
family
was
old
enough
to
form
a
company
meanwhile
he
worked
rather
by
encouraging
others
than
by
exertions
of
his
own
he
sauntered
up
to
mrs
athelny
who
had
been
busy
for
half
an
hour
and
had
already
emptied
a
basket
into
the
bin
and
with
his
cigarette
between
his
lips
began
to
pick
he
asserted
that
he
was
going
to
pick
more
than
anyone
that
day
but
mother
of
course
no
one
could
pick
so
much
as
mother
that
reminded
him
of
the
trials
which
aphrodite
put
upon
the
curious
psyche
and
he
began
to
tell
his
children
the
story
of
her
love
for
the
unseen
bridegroom
he
told
it
very
well
it
seemed
to
philip
listening
with
a
smile
on
his
lips
that
the
old
tale
fitted
in
with
the
scene
the
sky
was
very
blue
now
and
he
thought
it
could
not
be
more
lovely
even
in
greece
the
children
with
their
fair
hair
and
rosy
cheeks
strong
healthy
and
vivacious
the
delicate
form
of
the
hops
the
challenging
emerald
of
the
leaves
like
a
blare
of
trumpets
the
magic
of
the
green
alley
narrowing
to
a
point
as
you
looked
down
the
row
with
the
pickers
in
their
sunbonnets
perhaps
there
was
more
of
the
greek
spirit
there
than
you
could
find
in
the
books
of
professors
or
in
museums
he
was
thankful
for
the
beauty
of
england
he
thought
of
the
winding
white
roads
and
the
hedgerows
the
green
meadows
with
their
elmtrees
the
delicate
line
of
the
hills
and
the
copses
that
crowned
them
the
flatness
of
the
marshes
and
the
melancholy
of
the
north
sea
he
was
very
glad
that
he
felt
its
loveliness
but
presently
athelny
grew
restless
and
announced
that
he
would
go
and
ask
how
robert
kemps
mother
was
he
knew
everyone
in
the
garden
and
called
them
all
by
their
christian
names
he
knew
their
family
histories
and
all
that
had
happened
to
them
from
birth
with
harmless
vanity
he
played
the
fine
gentleman
among
them
and
there
was
a
touch
of
condescension
in
his
familiarity
philip
would
not
go
with
him
im
going
to
earn
my
dinner
he
said
quite
right
my
boy
answered
athelny
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
as
he
strolled
away
no
work
no
dinner
chapter
cxix
philip
had
not
a
basket
of
his
own
but
sat
with
sally
jane
thought
it
monstrous
that
he
should
help
her
elder
sister
rather
than
herself
and
he
had
to
promise
to
pick
for
her
when
sallys
basket
was
full
sally
was
almost
as
quick
as
her
mother
wont
it
hurt
your
hands
for
sewing
asked
philip
oh
no
it
wants
soft
hands
thats
why
women
pick
better
than
men
if
your
hands
are
hard
and
your
fingers
all
stiff
with
a
lot
of
rough
work
you
cant
pick
near
so
well
he
liked
to
see
her
deft
movements
and
she
watched
him
too
now
and
then
with
that
maternal
spirit
of
hers
which
was
so
amusing
and
yet
so
charming
he
was
clumsy
at
first
and
she
laughed
at
him
when
she
bent
over
and
showed
him
how
best
to
deal
with
a
whole
line
their
hands
met
he
was
surprised
to
see
her
blush
he
could
not
persuade
himself
that
she
was
a
woman
because
he
had
known
her
as
a
flapper
he
could
not
help
looking
upon
her
as
a
child
still
yet
the
number
of
her
admirers
showed
that
she
was
a
child
no
longer
and
though
they
had
only
been
down
a
few
days
one
of
sallys
cousins
was
already
so
attentive
that
she
had
to
endure
a
lot
of
chaffing
his
name
was
peter
gann
and
he
was
the
son
of
mrs
athelnys
sister
who
had
married
a
farmer
near
ferne
everyone
knew
why
he
found
it
necessary
to
walk
through
the
hopfield
every
day
a
calloff
by
the
sounding
of
a
horn
was
made
for
breakfast
at
eight
and
though
mrs
athelny
told
them
they
had
not
deserved
it
they
ate
it
very
heartily
they
set
to
work
again
and
worked
till
twelve
when
the
horn
sounded
once
more
for
dinner
at
intervals
the
measurer
went
his
round
from
bin
to
bin
accompanied
by
the
booker
who
entered
first
in
his
own
book
and
then
in
the
hoppers
the
number
of
bushels
picked
as
each
bin
was
filled
it
was
measured
out
in
bushel
baskets
into
a
huge
bag
called
a
poke
and
this
the
measurer
and
the
polepuller
carried
off
between
them
and
put
on
the
waggon
athelny
came
back
now
and
then
with
stories
of
how
much
mrs
heath
or
mrs
jones
had
picked
and
he
conjured
his
family
to
beat
her
he
was
always
wanting
to
make
records
and
sometimes
in
his
enthusiasm
picked
steadily
for
an
hour
his
chief
amusement
in
it
however
was
that
it
showed
the
beauty
of
his
graceful
hands
of
which
he
was
excessively
proud
he
spent
much
time
manicuring
them
he
told
philip
as
he
stretched
out
his
tapering
fingers
that
the
spanish
grandees
had
always
slept
in
oiled
gloves
to
preserve
their
whiteness
the
hand
that
wrung
the
throat
of
europe
he
remarked
dramatically
was
as
shapely
and
exquisite
as
a
womans
and
he
looked
at
his
own
as
he
delicately
picked
the
hops
and
sighed
with
selfsatisfaction
when
he
grew
tired
of
this
he
rolled
himself
a
cigarette
and
discoursed
to
philip
of
art
and
literature
in
the
afternoon
it
grew
very
hot
work
did
not
proceed
so
actively
and
conversation
halted
the
incessant
chatter
of
the
morning
dwindled
now
to
desultory
remarks
tiny
beads
of
sweat
stood
on
sallys
upper
lip
and
as
she
worked
her
lips
were
slightly
parted
she
was
like
a
rosebud
bursting
into
flower
callingoff
time
depended
on
the
state
of
the
oasthouse
sometimes
it
was
filled
early
and
as
many
hops
had
been
picked
by
three
or
four
as
could
be
dried
during
the
night
then
work
was
stopped
but
generally
the
last
measuring
of
the
day
began
at
five
as
each
company
had
its
bin
measured
it
gathered
up
its
things
and
chatting
again
now
that
work
was
over
sauntered
out
of
the
garden
the
women
went
back
to
the
huts
to
clean
up
and
prepare
the
supper
while
a
good
many
of
the
men
strolled
down
the
road
to
the
publichouse
a
glass
of
beer
was
very
pleasant
after
the
days
work
the
athelnys
bin
was
the
last
to
be
dealt
with
when
the
measurer
came
mrs
athelny
with
a
sigh
of
relief
stood
up
and
stretched
her
arms
she
had
been
sitting
in
the
same
position
for
many
hours
and
was
stiff
now
lets
go
to
the
jolly
sailor
said
athelny
the
rites
of
the
day
must
be
duly
performed
and
there
is
none
more
sacred
than
that
take
a
jug
with
you
athelny
said
his
wife
and
bring
back
a
pint
and
a
half
for
supper
she
gave
him
the
money
copper
by
copper
the
barparlour
was
already
well
filled
it
had
a
sanded
floor
benches
round
it
and
yellow
pictures
of
victorian
prizefighters
on
the
walls
the
licencee
knew
all
his
customers
by
name
and
he
leaned
over
his
bar
smiling
benignly
at
two
young
men
who
were
throwing
rings
on
a
stick
that
stood
up
from
the
floor
their
failure
was
greeted
with
a
good
deal
of
hearty
chaff
from
the
rest
of
the
company
room
was
made
for
the
new
arrivals
philip
found
himself
sitting
between
an
old
labourer
in
corduroys
with
string
tied
under
his
knees
and
a
shinyfaced
lad
of
seventeen
with
a
lovelock
neatly
plastered
on
his
red
forehead
athelny
insisted
on
trying
his
hand
at
the
throwing
of
rings
he
backed
himself
for
half
a
pint
and
won
it
as
he
drank
the
losers
health
he
said
i
would
sooner
have
won
this
than
won
the
derby
my
boy
he
was
an
outlandish
figure
with
his
widebrimmed
hat
and
pointed
beard
among
those
country
folk
and
it
was
easy
to
see
that
they
thought
him
very
queer
but
his
spirits
were
so
high
his
enthusiasm
so
contagious
that
it
was
impossible
not
to
like
him
conversation
went
easily
a
certain
number
of
pleasantries
were
exchanged
in
the
broad
slow
accent
of
the
isle
of
thanet
and
there
was
uproarious
laughter
at
the
sallies
of
the
local
wag
a
pleasant
gathering
it
would
have
been
a
hardhearted
person
who
did
not
feel
a
glow
of
satisfaction
in
his
fellows
philips
eyes
wandered
out
of
the
window
where
it
was
bright
and
sunny
still
there
were
little
white
curtains
in
it
tied
up
with
red
ribbon
like
those
of
a
cottage
window
and
on
the
sill
were
pots
of
geraniums
in
due
course
one
by
one
the
idlers
got
up
and
sauntered
back
to
the
meadow
where
supper
was
cooking
i
expect
youll
be
ready
for
your
bed
said
mrs
athelny
to
philip
youre
not
used
to
getting
up
at
five
and
staying
in
the
open
air
all
day
youre
coming
to
bathe
with
us
uncle
phil
arent
you
the
boys
cried
rather
he
was
tired
and
happy
after
supper
balancing
himself
against
the
wall
of
the
hut
on
a
chair
without
a
back
he
smoked
his
pipe
and
looked
at
the
night
sally
was
busy
she
passed
in
and
out
of
the
hut
and
he
lazily
watched
her
methodical
actions
her
walk
attracted
his
notice
it
was
not
particularly
graceful
but
it
was
easy
and
assured
she
swung
her
legs
from
the
hips
and
her
feet
seemed
to
tread
the
earth
with
decision
athelny
had
gone
off
to
gossip
with
one
of
the
neighbours
and
presently
philip
heard
his
wife
address
the
world
in
general
there
now
im
out
of
tea
and
i
wanted
athelny
to
go
down
to
mrs
blacks
and
get
some
a
pause
and
then
her
voice
was
raised
sally
just
run
down
to
mrs
blacks
and
get
me
half
a
pound
of
tea
will
you
ive
run
quite
out
of
it
all
right
mother
mrs
black
had
a
cottage
about
half
a
mile
along
the
road
and
she
combined
the
office
of
postmistress
with
that
of
universal
provider
sally
came
out
of
the
hut
turning
down
her
sleeves
shall
i
come
with
you
sally
asked
philip
dont
you
trouble
im
not
afraid
to
go
alone
i
didnt
think
you
were
but
its
getting
near
my
bedtime
and
i
was
just
thinking
id
like
to
stretch
my
legs
sally
did
not
answer
and
they
set
out
together
the
road
was
white
and
silent
there
was
not
a
sound
in
the
summer
night
they
did
not
speak
much
its
quite
hot
even
now
isnt
it
said
philip
i
think
its
wonderful
for
the
time
of
year
but
their
silence
did
not
seem
awkward
they
found
it
was
pleasant
to
walk
side
by
side
and
felt
no
need
of
words
suddenly
at
a
stile
in
the
hedgerow
they
heard
a
low
murmur
of
voices
and
in
the
darkness
they
saw
the
outline
of
two
people
they
were
sitting
very
close
to
one
another
and
did
not
move
as
philip
and
sally
passed
i
wonder
who
that
was
said
sally
they
looked
happy
enough
didnt
they
i
expect
they
took
us
for
lovers
too
they
saw
the
light
of
the
cottage
in
front
of
them
and
in
a
minute
went
into
the
little
shop
the
glare
dazzled
them
for
a
moment
you
are
late
said
mrs
black
i
was
just
going
to
shut
up
she
looked
at
the
clock
getting
on
for
nine
sally
asked
for
her
half
pound
of
tea
mrs
athelny
could
never
bring
herself
to
buy
more
than
half
a
pound
at
a
time
and
they
set
off
up
the
road
again
now
and
then
some
beast
of
the
night
made
a
short
sharp
sound
but
it
seemed
only
to
make
the
silence
more
marked
i
believe
if
you
stood
still
you
could
hear
the
sea
said
sally
they
strained
their
ears
and
their
fancy
presented
them
with
a
faint
sound
of
little
waves
lapping
up
against
the
shingle
when
they
passed
the
stile
again
the
lovers
were
still
there
but
now
they
were
not
speaking
they
were
in
one
anothers
arms
and
the
mans
lips
were
pressed
against
the
girls
they
seem
busy
said
sally
they
turned
a
corner
and
a
breath
of
warm
wind
beat
for
a
moment
against
their
faces
the
earth
gave
forth
its
freshness
there
was
something
strange
in
the
tremulous
night
and
something
you
knew
not
what
seemed
to
be
waiting
the
silence
was
on
a
sudden
pregnant
with
meaning
philip
had
a
queer
feeling
in
his
heart
it
seemed
very
full
it
seemed
to
melt
the
hackneyed
phrases
expressed
precisely
the
curious
sensation
he
felt
happy
and
anxious
and
expectant
to
his
memory
came
back
those
lines
in
which
jessica
and
lorenzo
murmur
melodious
words
to
one
another
capping
each
others
utterance
but
passion
shines
bright
and
clear
through
the
conceits
that
amuse
them
he
did
not
know
what
there
was
in
the
air
that
made
his
senses
so
strangely
alert
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
pure
soul
to
enjoy
the
scents
and
the
sounds
and
the
savours
of
the
earth
he
had
never
felt
such
an
exquisite
capacity
for
beauty
he
was
afraid
that
sally
by
speaking
would
break
the
spell
but
she
said
never
a
word
and
he
wanted
to
hear
the
sound
of
her
voice
its
low
richness
was
the
voice
of
the
country
night
itself
they
arrived
at
the
field
through
which
she
had
to
walk
to
get
back
to
the
huts
philip
went
in
to
hold
the
gate
open
for
her
well
here
i
think
ill
say
goodnight
thank
you
for
coming
all
that
way
with
me
she
gave
him
her
hand
and
as
he
took
it
he
said
if
you
were
very
nice
youd
kiss
me
goodnight
like
the
rest
of
the
family
i
dont
mind
she
said
philip
had
spoken
in
jest
he
merely
wanted
to
kiss
her
because
he
was
happy
and
he
liked
her
and
the
night
was
so
lovely
goodnight
then
he
said
with
a
little
laugh
drawing
her
towards
him
she
gave
him
her
lips
they
were
warm
and
full
and
soft
he
lingered
a
little
they
were
like
a
flower
then
he
knew
not
how
without
meaning
it
he
flung
his
arms
round
her
she
yielded
quite
silently
her
body
was
firm
and
strong
he
felt
her
heart
beat
against
his
then
he
lost
his
head
his
senses
overwhelmed
him
like
a
flood
of
rushing
waters
he
drew
her
into
the
darker
shadow
of
the
hedge
chapter
cxx
philip
slept
like
a
log
and
awoke
with
a
start
to
find
harold
tickling
his
face
with
a
feather
there
was
a
shout
of
delight
when
he
opened
his
eyes
he
was
drunken
with
sleep
come
on
lazybones
said
jane
sally
says
she
wont
wait
for
you
unless
you
hurry
up
then
he
remembered
what
had
happened
his
heart
sank
and
half
out
of
bed
already
he
stopped
he
did
not
know
how
he
was
going
to
face
her
he
was
overwhelmed
with
a
sudden
rush
of
selfreproach
and
bitterly
bitterly
he
regretted
what
he
had
done
what
would
she
say
to
him
that
morning
he
dreaded
meeting
her
and
he
asked
himself
how
he
could
have
been
such
a
fool
but
the
children
gave
him
no
time
edward
took
his
bathingdrawers
and
his
towel
athelstan
tore
the
bedclothes
away
and
in
three
minutes
they
all
clattered
down
into
the
road
sally
gave
him
a
smile
it
was
as
sweet
and
innocent
as
it
had
ever
been
you
do
take
a
time
to
dress
yourself
she
said
i
thought
you
was
never
coming
there
was
not
a
particle
of
difference
in
her
manner
he
had
expected
some
change
subtle
or
abrupt
he
fancied
that
there
would
be
shame
in
the
way
she
treated
him
or
anger
or
perhaps
some
increase
of
familiarity
but
there
was
nothing
she
was
exactly
the
same
as
before
they
walked
towards
the
sea
all
together
talking
and
laughing
and
sally
was
quiet
but
she
was
always
that
reserved
but
he
had
never
seen
her
otherwise
and
gentle
she
neither
sought
conversation
with
him
nor
avoided
it
philip
was
astounded
he
had
expected
the
incident
of
the
night
before
to
have
caused
some
revolution
in
her
but
it
was
just
as
though
nothing
had
happened
it
might
have
been
a
dream
and
as
he
walked
along
a
little
girl
holding
on
to
one
hand
and
a
little
boy
to
the
other
while
he
chatted
as
unconcernedly
as
he
could
he
sought
for
an
explanation
he
wondered
whether
sally
meant
the
affair
to
be
forgotten
perhaps
her
senses
had
run
away
with
her
just
as
his
had
and
treating
what
had
occurred
as
an
accident
due
to
unusual
circumstances
it
might
be
that
she
had
decided
to
put
the
matter
out
of
her
mind
it
was
ascribing
to
her
a
power
of
thought
and
a
mature
wisdom
which
fitted
neither
with
her
age
nor
with
her
character
but
he
realised
that
he
knew
nothing
of
her
there
had
been
in
her
always
something
enigmatic
they
played
leapfrog
in
the
water
and
the
bathe
was
as
uproarious
as
on
the
previous
day
sally
mothered
them
all
keeping
a
watchful
eye
on
them
and
calling
to
them
when
they
went
out
too
far
she
swam
staidly
backwards
and
forwards
while
the
others
got
up
to
their
larks
and
now
and
then
turned
on
her
back
to
float
presently
she
went
out
and
began
drying
herself
she
called
to
the
others
more
or
less
peremptorily
and
at
last
only
philip
was
left
in
the
water
he
took
the
opportunity
to
have
a
good
hard
swim
he
was
more
used
to
the
cold
water
this
second
morning
and
he
revelled
in
its
salt
freshness
it
rejoiced
him
to
use
his
limbs
freely
and
he
covered
the
water
with
long
firm
strokes
but
sally
with
a
towel
round
her
went
down
to
the
waters
edge
youre
to
come
out
this
minute
philip
she
called
as
though
he
were
a
small
boy
under
her
charge
and
when
smiling
with
amusement
at
her
authoritative
way
he
came
towards
her
she
upbraided
him
it
is
naughty
of
you
to
stay
in
so
long
your
lips
are
quite
blue
and
just
look
at
your
teeth
theyre
chattering
all
right
ill
come
out
she
had
never
talked
to
him
in
that
manner
before
it
was
as
though
what
had
happened
gave
her
a
sort
of
right
over
him
and
she
looked
upon
him
as
a
child
to
be
cared
for
in
a
few
minutes
they
were
dressed
and
they
started
to
walk
back
sally
noticed
his
hands
just
look
theyre
quite
blue
oh
thats
all
right
its
only
the
circulation
i
shall
get
the
blood
back
in
a
minute
give
them
to
me
she
took
his
hands
in
hers
and
rubbed
them
first
one
and
then
the
other
till
the
colour
returned
philip
touched
and
puzzled
watched
her
he
could
not
say
anything
to
her
on
account
of
the
children
and
he
did
not
meet
her
eyes
but
he
was
sure
they
did
not
avoid
his
purposely
it
just
happened
that
they
did
not
meet
and
during
the
day
there
was
nothing
in
her
behaviour
to
suggest
a
consciousness
in
her
that
anything
had
passed
between
them
perhaps
she
was
a
little
more
talkative
than
usual
when
they
were
all
sitting
again
in
the
hopfield
she
told
her
mother
how
naughty
philip
had
been
in
not
coming
out
of
the
water
till
he
was
blue
with
cold
it
was
incredible
and
yet
it
seemed
that
the
only
effect
of
the
incident
of
the
night
before
was
to
arouse
in
her
a
feeling
of
protection
towards
him
she
had
the
same
instinctive
desire
to
mother
him
as
she
had
with
regard
to
her
brothers
and
sisters
it
was
not
till
the
evening
that
he
found
himself
alone
with
her
she
was
cooking
the
supper
and
philip
was
sitting
on
the
grass
by
the
side
of
the
fire
mrs
athelny
had
gone
down
to
the
village
to
do
some
shopping
and
the
children
were
scattered
in
various
pursuits
of
their
own
philip
hesitated
to
speak
he
was
very
nervous
sally
attended
to
her
business
with
serene
competence
and
she
accepted
placidly
the
silence
which
to
him
was
so
embarrassing
he
did
not
know
how
to
begin
sally
seldom
spoke
unless
she
was
spoken
to
or
had
something
particular
to
say
at
last
he
could
not
bear
it
any
longer
youre
not
angry
with
me
sally
he
blurted
out
suddenly
she
raised
her
eyes
quietly
and
looked
at
him
without
emotion
me
no
why
should
i
be
he
was
taken
aback
and
did
not
reply
she
took
the
lid
off
the
pot
stirred
the
contents
and
put
it
on
again
a
savoury
smell
spread
over
the
air
she
looked
at
him
once
more
with
a
quiet
smile
which
barely
separated
her
lips
it
was
more
a
smile
of
the
eyes
i
always
liked
you
she
said
his
heart
gave
a
great
thump
against
his
ribs
and
he
felt
the
blood
rushing
to
his
cheeks
he
forced
a
faint
laugh
i
didnt
know
that
thats
because
youre
a
silly
i
dont
know
why
you
liked
me
i
dont
either
she
put
a
little
more
wood
on
the
fire
i
knew
i
liked
you
that
day
you
came
when
youd
been
sleeping
out
and
hadnt
had
anything
to
eat
dyou
remember
and
me
and
mother
we
got
thorpys
bed
ready
for
you
he
flushed
again
for
he
did
not
know
that
she
was
aware
of
that
incident
he
remembered
it
himself
with
horror
and
shame
thats
why
i
wouldnt
have
anything
to
do
with
the
others
you
remember
that
young
fellow
mother
wanted
me
to
have
i
let
him
come
to
tea
because
he
bothered
so
but
i
knew
id
say
no
philip
was
so
surprised
that
he
found
nothing
to
say
there
was
a
queer
feeling
in
his
heart
he
did
not
know
what
it
was
unless
it
was
happiness
sally
stirred
the
pot
once
more
i
wish
those
children
would
make
haste
and
come
i
dont
know
where
theyve
got
to
suppers
ready
now
shall
i
go
and
see
if
i
can
find
them
said
philip
it
was
a
relief
to
talk
about
practical
things
well
it
wouldnt
be
a
bad
idea
i
must
say
theres
mother
coming
then
as
he
got
up
she
looked
at
him
without
embarrassment
shall
i
come
for
a
walk
with
you
tonight
when
ive
put
the
children
to
bed
yes
well
you
wait
for
me
down
by
the
stile
and
ill
come
when
im
ready
he
waited
under
the
stars
sitting
on
the
stile
and
the
hedges
with
their
ripening
blackberries
were
high
on
each
side
of
him
from
the
earth
rose
rich
scents
of
the
night
and
the
air
was
soft
and
still
his
heart
was
beating
madly
he
could
not
understand
anything
of
what
happened
to
him
he
associated
passion
with
cries
and
tears
and
vehemence
and
there
was
nothing
of
this
in
sally
but
he
did
not
know
what
else
but
passion
could
have
caused
her
to
give
herself
but
passion
for
him
he
would
not
have
been
surprised
if
she
had
fallen
to
her
cousin
peter
gann
tall
spare
and
straight
with
his
sunburned
face
and
long
easy
stride
philip
wondered
what
she
saw
in
him
he
did
not
know
if
she
loved
him
as
he
reckoned
love
and
yet
he
was
convinced
of
her
purity
he
had
a
vague
inkling
that
many
things
had
combined
things
that
she
felt
though
was
unconscious
of
the
intoxication
of
the
air
and
the
hops
and
the
night
the
healthy
instincts
of
the
natural
woman
a
tenderness
that
overflowed
and
an
affection
that
had
in
it
something
maternal
and
something
sisterly
and
she
gave
all
she
had
to
give
because
her
heart
was
full
of
charity
he
heard
a
step
on
the
road
and
a
figure
came
out
of
the
darkness
sally
he
murmured
she
stopped
and
came
to
the
stile
and
with
her
came
sweet
clean
odours
of
the
countryside
she
seemed
to
carry
with
her
scents
of
the
newmown
hay
and
the
savour
of
ripe
hops
and
the
freshness
of
young
grass
her
lips
were
soft
and
full
against
his
and
her
lovely
strong
body
was
firm
within
his
arms
milk
and
honey
he
said
youre
like
milk
and
honey
he
made
her
close
her
eyes
and
kissed
her
eyelids
first
one
and
then
the
other
her
arm
strong
and
muscular
was
bare
to
the
elbow
he
passed
his
hand
over
it
and
wondered
at
its
beauty
it
gleamed
in
the
darkness
she
had
the
skin
that
rubens
painted
astonishingly
fair
and
transparent
and
on
one
side
were
little
golden
hairs
it
was
the
arm
of
a
saxon
goddess
but
no
immortal
had
that
exquisite
homely
naturalness
and
philip
thought
of
a
cottage
garden
with
the
dear
flowers
which
bloom
in
all
mens
hearts
of
the
hollyhock
and
the
red
and
white
rose
which
is
called
york
and
lancaster
and
of
loveinamist
and
sweet
william
and
honeysuckle
larkspur
and
london
pride
how
can
you
care
for
me
he
said
im
insignificant
and
crippled
and
ordinary
and
ugly
she
took
his
face
in
both
her
hands
and
kissed
his
lips
youre
an
old
silly
thats
what
you
are
she
said
chapter
cxxi
when
the
hops
were
picked
philip
with
the
news
in
his
pocket
that
he
had
got
the
appointment
as
assistant
housephysician
at
st
lukes
accompanied
the
athelnys
back
to
london
he
took
modest
rooms
in
westminster
and
at
the
beginning
of
october
entered
upon
his
duties
the
work
was
interesting
and
varied
every
day
he
learned
something
new
he
felt
himself
of
some
consequence
and
he
saw
a
good
deal
of
sally
he
found
life
uncommonly
pleasant
he
was
free
about
six
except
on
the
days
on
which
he
had
outpatients
and
then
he
went
to
the
shop
at
which
sally
worked
to
meet
her
when
she
came
out
there
were
several
young
men
who
hung
about
opposite
the
trade
entrance
or
a
little
further
along
at
the
first
corner
and
the
girls
coming
out
two
and
two
or
in
little
groups
nudged
one
another
and
giggled
as
they
recognised
them
sally
in
her
plain
black
dress
looked
very
different
from
the
country
lass
who
had
picked
hops
side
by
side
with
him
she
walked
away
from
the
shop
quickly
but
she
slackened
her
pace
when
they
met
and
greeted
him
with
her
quiet
smile
they
walked
together
through
the
busy
street
he
talked
to
her
of
his
work
at
the
hospital
and
she
told
him
what
she
had
been
doing
in
the
shop
that
day
he
came
to
know
the
names
of
the
girls
she
worked
with
he
found
that
sally
had
a
restrained
but
keen
sense
of
the
ridiculous
and
she
made
remarks
about
the
girls
or
the
men
who
were
set
over
them
which
amused
him
by
their
unexpected
drollery
she
had
a
way
of
saying
a
thing
which
was
very
characteristic
quite
gravely
as
though
there
were
nothing
funny
in
it
at
all
and
yet
it
was
so
sharpsighted
that
philip
broke
into
delighted
laughter
then
she
would
give
him
a
little
glance
in
which
the
smiling
eyes
showed
she
was
not
unaware
of
her
own
humour
they
met
with
a
handshake
and
parted
as
formally
once
philip
asked
her
to
come
and
have
tea
with
him
in
his
rooms
but
she
refused
no
i
wont
do
that
it
would
look
funny
never
a
word
of
love
passed
between
them
she
seemed
not
to
desire
anything
more
than
the
companionship
of
those
walks
yet
philip
was
positive
that
she
was
glad
to
be
with
him
she
puzzled
him
as
much
as
she
had
done
at
the
beginning
he
did
not
begin
to
understand
her
conduct
but
the
more
he
knew
her
the
fonder
he
grew
of
her
she
was
competent
and
self
controlled
and
there
was
a
charming
honesty
in
her
you
felt
that
you
could
rely
upon
her
in
every
circumstance
you
are
an
awfully
good
sort
he
said
to
her
once
a
propos
of
nothing
at
all
i
expect
im
just
the
same
as
everyone
else
she
answered
he
knew
that
he
did
not
love
her
it
was
a
great
affection
that
he
felt
for
her
and
he
liked
her
company
it
was
curiously
soothing
and
he
had
a
feeling
for
her
which
seemed
to
him
ridiculous
to
entertain
towards
a
shopgirl
of
nineteen
he
respected
her
and
he
admired
her
magnificent
healthiness
she
was
a
splendid
animal
without
defect
and
physical
perfection
filled
him
always
with
admiring
awe
she
made
him
feel
unworthy
then
one
day
about
three
weeks
after
they
had
come
back
to
london
as
they
walked
together
he
noticed
that
she
was
unusually
silent
the
serenity
of
her
expression
was
altered
by
a
slight
line
between
the
eyebrows
it
was
the
beginning
of
a
frown
whats
the
matter
sally
he
asked
she
did
not
look
at
him
but
straight
in
front
of
her
and
her
colour
darkened
i
dont
know
he
understood
at
once
what
she
meant
his
heart
gave
a
sudden
quick
beat
and
he
felt
the
colour
leave
his
cheeks
what
dyou
mean
are
you
afraid
that

he
stopped
he
could
not
go
on
the
possibility
that
anything
of
the
sort
could
happen
had
never
crossed
his
mind
then
he
saw
that
her
lips
were
trembling
and
she
was
trying
not
to
cry
im
not
certain
yet
perhaps
itll
be
all
right
they
walked
on
in
silence
till
they
came
to
the
corner
of
chancery
lane
where
he
always
left
her
she
held
out
her
hand
and
smiled
dont
worry
about
it
yet
lets
hope
for
the
best
he
walked
away
with
a
tumult
of
thoughts
in
his
head
what
a
fool
he
had
been
that
was
the
first
thing
that
struck
him
an
abject
miserable
fool
and
he
repeated
it
to
himself
a
dozen
times
in
a
rush
of
angry
feeling
he
despised
himself
how
could
he
have
got
into
such
a
mess
but
at
the
same
time
for
his
thoughts
chased
one
another
through
his
brain
and
yet
seemed
to
stand
together
in
a
hopeless
confusion
like
the
pieces
of
a
jigsaw
puzzle
seen
in
a
nightmare
he
asked
himself
what
he
was
going
to
do
everything
was
so
clear
before
him
all
he
had
aimed
at
so
long
within
reach
at
last
and
now
his
inconceivable
stupidity
had
erected
this
new
obstacle
philip
had
never
been
able
to
surmount
what
he
acknowledged
was
a
defect
in
his
resolute
desire
for
a
well
ordered
life
and
that
was
his
passion
for
living
in
the
future
and
no
sooner
was
he
settled
in
his
work
at
the
hospital
than
he
had
busied
himself
with
arrangements
for
his
travels
in
the
past
he
had
often
tried
not
to
think
too
circumstantially
of
his
plans
for
the
future
it
was
only
discouraging
but
now
that
his
goal
was
so
near
he
saw
no
harm
in
giving
away
to
a
longing
that
was
so
difficult
to
resist
first
of
all
he
meant
to
go
to
spain
that
was
the
land
of
his
heart
and
by
now
he
was
imbued
with
its
spirit
its
romance
and
colour
and
history
and
grandeur
he
felt
that
it
had
a
message
for
him
in
particular
which
no
other
country
could
give
he
knew
the
fine
old
cities
already
as
though
he
had
trodden
their
tortuous
streets
from
childhood
cordova
seville
toledo
leon
tarragona
burgos
the
great
painters
of
spain
were
the
painters
of
his
soul
and
his
pulse
beat
quickly
as
he
pictured
his
ecstasy
on
standing
face
to
face
with
those
works
which
were
more
significant
than
any
others
to
his
own
tortured
restless
heart
he
had
read
the
great
poets
more
characteristic
of
their
race
than
the
poets
of
other
lands
for
they
seemed
to
have
drawn
their
inspiration
not
at
all
from
the
general
currents
of
the
worlds
literature
but
directly
from
the
torrid
scented
plains
and
the
bleak
mountains
of
their
country
a
few
short
months
now
and
he
would
hear
with
his
own
ears
all
around
him
the
language
which
seemed
most
apt
for
grandeur
of
soul
and
passion
his
fine
taste
had
given
him
an
inkling
that
andalusia
was
too
soft
and
sensuous
a
little
vulgar
even
to
satisfy
his
ardour
and
his
imagination
dwelt
more
willingly
among
the
windswept
distances
of
castile
and
the
rugged
magnificence
of
aragon
and
leon
he
did
not
know
quite
what
those
unknown
contacts
would
give
him
but
he
felt
that
he
would
gather
from
them
a
strength
and
a
purpose
which
would
make
him
more
capable
of
affronting
and
comprehending
the
manifold
wonders
of
places
more
distant
and
more
strange
for
this
was
only
a
beginning
he
had
got
into
communication
with
the
various
companies
which
took
surgeons
out
on
their
ships
and
knew
exactly
what
were
their
routes
and
from
men
who
had
been
on
them
what
were
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
each
line
he
put
aside
the
orient
and
the
p

o
it
was
difficult
to
get
a
berth
with
them
and
besides
their
passenger
traffic
allowed
the
medical
officer
little
freedom
but
there
were
other
services
which
sent
large
tramps
on
leisurely
expeditions
to
the
east
stopping
at
all
sorts
of
ports
for
various
periods
from
a
day
or
two
to
a
fortnight
so
that
you
had
plenty
of
time
and
it
was
often
possible
to
make
a
trip
inland
the
pay
was
poor
and
the
food
no
more
than
adequate
so
that
there
was
not
much
demand
for
the
posts
and
a
man
with
a
london
degree
was
pretty
sure
to
get
one
if
he
applied
since
there
were
no
passengers
other
than
a
casual
man
or
so
shipping
on
business
from
some
outoftheway
port
to
another
the
life
on
board
was
friendly
and
pleasant
philip
knew
by
heart
the
list
of
places
at
which
they
touched
and
each
one
called
up
in
him
visions
of
tropical
sunshine
and
magic
colour
and
of
a
teeming
mysterious
intense
life
life
that
was
what
he
wanted
at
last
he
would
come
to
close
quarters
with
life
and
perhaps
from
tokyo
or
shanghai
it
would
be
possible
to
tranship
into
some
other
line
and
drip
down
to
the
islands
of
the
south
pacific
a
doctor
was
useful
anywhere
there
might
be
an
opportunity
to
go
up
country
in
burmah
and
what
rich
jungles
in
sumatra
or
borneo
might
he
not
visit
he
was
young
still
and
time
was
no
object
to
him
he
had
no
ties
in
england
no
friends
he
could
go
up
and
down
the
world
for
years
learning
the
beauty
and
the
wonder
and
the
variedness
of
life
now
this
thing
had
come
he
put
aside
the
possibility
that
sally
was
mistaken
he
felt
strangely
certain
that
she
was
right
after
all
it
was
so
likely
anyone
could
see
that
nature
had
built
her
to
be
the
mother
of
children
he
knew
what
he
ought
to
do
he
ought
not
to
let
the
incident
divert
him
a
hairs
breadth
from
his
path
he
thought
of
griffiths
he
could
easily
imagine
with
what
indifference
that
young
man
would
have
received
such
a
piece
of
news
he
would
have
thought
it
an
awful
nuisance
and
would
at
once
have
taken
to
his
heels
like
a
wise
fellow
he
would
have
left
the
girl
to
deal
with
her
troubles
as
best
she
could
philip
told
himself
that
if
this
had
happened
it
was
because
it
was
inevitable
he
was
no
more
to
blame
than
sally
she
was
a
girl
who
knew
the
world
and
the
facts
of
life
and
she
had
taken
the
risk
with
her
eyes
open
it
would
be
madness
to
allow
such
an
accident
to
disturb
the
whole
pattern
of
his
life
he
was
one
of
the
few
people
who
was
acutely
conscious
of
the
transitoriness
of
life
and
how
necessary
it
was
to
make
the
most
of
it
he
would
do
what
he
could
for
sally
he
could
afford
to
give
her
a
sufficient
sum
of
money
a
strong
man
would
never
allow
himself
to
be
turned
from
his
purpose
philip
said
all
this
to
himself
but
he
knew
he
could
not
do
it
he
simply
could
not
he
knew
himself
im
so
damned
weak
he
muttered
despairingly
she
had
trusted
him
and
been
kind
to
him
he
simply
could
not
do
a
thing
which
notwithstanding
all
his
reason
he
felt
was
horrible
he
knew
he
would
have
no
peace
on
his
travels
if
he
had
the
thought
constantly
with
him
that
she
was
wretched
besides
there
were
her
father
and
mother
they
had
always
treated
him
well
it
was
not
possible
to
repay
them
with
ingratitude
the
only
thing
was
to
marry
sally
as
quickly
as
possible
he
would
write
to
doctor
south
tell
him
he
was
going
to
be
married
at
once
and
say
that
if
his
offer
still
held
he
was
willing
to
accept
it
that
sort
of
practice
among
poor
people
was
the
only
one
possible
for
him
there
his
deformity
did
not
matter
and
they
would
not
sneer
at
the
simple
manners
of
his
wife
it
was
curious
to
think
of
her
as
his
wife
it
gave
him
a
queer
soft
feeling
and
a
wave
of
emotion
spread
over
him
as
he
thought
of
the
child
which
was
his
he
had
little
doubt
that
doctor
south
would
be
glad
to
have
him
and
he
pictured
to
himself
the
life
he
would
lead
with
sally
in
the
fishing
village
they
would
have
a
little
house
within
sight
of
the
sea
and
he
would
watch
the
mighty
ships
passing
to
the
lands
he
would
never
know
perhaps
that
was
the
wisest
thing
cronshaw
had
told
him
that
the
facts
of
life
mattered
nothing
to
him
who
by
the
power
of
fancy
held
in
fee
the
twin
realms
of
space
and
time
it
was
true
forever
wilt
thou
love
and
she
be
fair
his
wedding
present
to
his
wife
would
be
all
his
high
hopes
selfsacrifice
philip
was
uplifted
by
its
beauty
and
all
through
the
evening
he
thought
of
it
he
was
so
excited
that
he
could
not
read
he
seemed
to
be
driven
out
of
his
rooms
into
the
streets
and
he
walked
up
and
down
birdcage
walk
his
heart
throbbing
with
joy
he
could
hardly
bear
his
impatience
he
wanted
to
see
sallys
happiness
when
he
made
her
his
offer
and
if
it
had
not
been
so
late
he
would
have
gone
to
her
there
and
then
he
pictured
to
himself
the
long
evenings
he
would
spend
with
sally
in
the
cosy
sittingroom
the
blinds
undrawn
so
that
they
could
watch
the
sea
he
with
his
books
while
she
bent
over
her
work
and
the
shaded
lamp
made
her
sweet
face
more
fair
they
would
talk
over
the
growing
child
and
when
she
turned
her
eyes
to
his
there
was
in
them
the
light
of
love
and
the
fishermen
and
their
wives
who
were
his
patients
would
come
to
feel
a
great
affection
for
them
and
they
in
their
turn
would
enter
into
the
pleasures
and
pains
of
those
simple
lives
but
his
thoughts
returned
to
the
son
who
would
be
his
and
hers
already
he
felt
in
himself
a
passionate
devotion
to
it
he
thought
of
passing
his
hands
over
his
little
perfect
limbs
he
knew
he
would
be
beautiful
and
he
would
make
over
to
him
all
his
dreams
of
a
rich
and
varied
life
and
thinking
over
the
long
pilgrimage
of
his
past
he
accepted
it
joyfully
he
accepted
the
deformity
which
had
made
life
so
hard
for
him
he
knew
that
it
had
warped
his
character
but
now
he
saw
also
that
by
reason
of
it
he
had
acquired
that
power
of
introspection
which
had
given
him
so
much
delight
without
it
he
would
never
have
had
his
keen
appreciation
of
beauty
his
passion
for
art
and
literature
and
his
interest
in
the
varied
spectacle
of
life
the
ridicule
and
the
contempt
which
had
so
often
been
heaped
upon
him
had
turned
his
mind
inward
and
called
forth
those
flowers
which
he
felt
would
never
lose
their
fragrance
then
he
saw
that
the
normal
was
the
rarest
thing
in
the
world
everyone
had
some
defect
of
body
or
of
mind
he
thought
of
all
the
people
he
had
known
the
whole
world
was
like
a
sickhouse
and
there
was
no
rhyme
or
reason
in
it
he
saw
a
long
procession
deformed
in
body
and
warped
in
mind
some
with
illness
of
the
flesh
weak
hearts
or
weak
lungs
and
some
with
illness
of
the
spirit
languor
of
will
or
a
craving
for
liquor
at
this
moment
he
could
feel
a
holy
compassion
for
them
all
they
were
the
helpless
instruments
of
blind
chance
he
could
pardon
griffiths
for
his
treachery
and
mildred
for
the
pain
she
had
caused
him
they
could
not
help
themselves
the
only
reasonable
thing
was
to
accept
the
good
of
men
and
be
patient
with
their
faults
the
words
of
the
dying
god
crossed
his
memory
forgive
them
for
they
know
not
what
they
do
chapter
cxxii
he
had
arranged
to
meet
sally
on
saturday
in
the
national
gallery
she
was
to
come
there
as
soon
as
she
was
released
from
the
shop
and
had
agreed
to
lunch
with
him
two
days
had
passed
since
he
had
seen
her
and
his
exultation
had
not
left
him
for
a
moment
it
was
because
he
rejoiced
in
the
feeling
that
he
had
not
attempted
to
see
her
he
had
repeated
to
himself
exactly
what
he
would
say
to
her
and
how
he
should
say
it
now
his
impatience
was
unbearable
he
had
written
to
doctor
south
and
had
in
his
pocket
a
telegram
from
him
received
that
morning
sacking
the
mumpish
fool
when
will
you
come
philip
walked
along
parliament
street
it
was
a
fine
day
and
there
was
a
bright
frosty
sun
which
made
the
light
dance
in
the
street
it
was
crowded
there
was
a
tenuous
mist
in
the
distance
and
it
softened
exquisitely
the
noble
lines
of
the
buildings
he
crossed
trafalgar
square
suddenly
his
heart
gave
a
sort
of
twist
in
his
body
he
saw
a
woman
in
front
of
him
who
he
thought
was
mildred
she
had
the
same
figure
and
she
walked
with
that
slight
dragging
of
the
feet
which
was
so
characteristic
of
her
without
thinking
but
with
a
beating
heart
he
hurried
till
he
came
alongside
and
then
when
the
woman
turned
he
saw
it
was
someone
unknown
to
him
it
was
the
face
of
a
much
older
person
with
a
lined
yellow
skin
he
slackened
his
pace
he
was
infinitely
relieved
but
it
was
not
only
relief
that
he
felt
it
was
disappointment
too
he
was
seized
with
horror
of
himself
would
he
never
be
free
from
that
passion
at
the
bottom
of
his
heart
notwithstanding
everything
he
felt
that
a
strange
desperate
thirst
for
that
vile
woman
would
always
linger
that
love
had
caused
him
so
much
suffering
that
he
knew
he
would
never
never
quite
be
free
of
it
only
death
could
finally
assuage
his
desire
but
he
wrenched
the
pang
from
his
heart
he
thought
of
sally
with
her
kind
blue
eyes
and
his
lips
unconsciously
formed
themselves
into
a
smile
he
walked
up
the
steps
of
the
national
gallery
and
sat
down
in
the
first
room
so
that
he
should
see
her
the
moment
she
came
in
it
always
comforted
him
to
get
among
pictures
he
looked
at
none
in
particular
but
allowed
the
magnificence
of
their
colour
the
beauty
of
their
lines
to
work
upon
his
soul
his
imagination
was
busy
with
sally
it
would
be
pleasant
to
take
her
away
from
that
london
in
which
she
seemed
an
unusual
figure
like
a
cornflower
in
a
shop
among
orchids
and
azaleas
he
had
learned
in
the
kentish
hopfield
that
she
did
not
belong
to
the
town
and
he
was
sure
that
she
would
blossom
under
the
soft
skies
of
dorset
to
a
rarer
beauty
she
came
in
and
he
got
up
to
meet
her
she
was
in
black
with
white
cuffs
at
her
wrists
and
a
lawn
collar
round
her
neck
they
shook
hands
have
you
been
waiting
long
no
ten
minutes
are
you
hungry
not
very
lets
sit
here
for
a
bit
shall
we
if
you
like
they
sat
quietly
side
by
side
without
speaking
philip
enjoyed
having
her
near
him
he
was
warmed
by
her
radiant
health
a
glow
of
life
seemed
like
an
aureole
to
shine
about
her
well
how
have
you
been
he
said
at
last
with
a
little
smile
oh
its
all
right
it
was
a
false
alarm
was
it
arent
you
glad
an
extraordinary
sensation
filled
him
he
had
felt
certain
that
sallys
suspicion
was
wellfounded
it
had
never
occurred
to
him
for
an
instant
that
there
was
a
possibility
of
error
all
his
plans
were
suddenly
overthrown
and
the
existence
so
elaborately
pictured
was
no
more
than
a
dream
which
would
never
be
realised
he
was
free
once
more
free
he
need
give
up
none
of
his
projects
and
life
still
was
in
his
hands
for
him
to
do
what
he
liked
with
he
felt
no
exhilaration
but
only
dismay
his
heart
sank
the
future
stretched
out
before
him
in
desolate
emptiness
it
was
as
though
he
had
sailed
for
many
years
over
a
great
waste
of
waters
with
peril
and
privation
and
at
last
had
come
upon
a
fair
haven
but
as
he
was
about
to
enter
some
contrary
wind
had
arisen
and
drove
him
out
again
into
the
open
sea
and
because
he
had
let
his
mind
dwell
on
these
soft
meads
and
pleasant
woods
of
the
land
the
vast
deserts
of
the
ocean
filled
him
with
anguish
he
could
not
confront
again
the
loneliness
and
the
tempest
sally
looked
at
him
with
her
clear
eyes
arent
you
glad
she
asked
again
i
thought
youd
be
as
pleased
as
punch
he
met
her
gaze
haggardly
im
not
sure
he
muttered
you
are
funny
most
men
would
he
realised
that
he
had
deceived
himself
it
was
no
selfsacrifice
that
had
driven
him
to
think
of
marrying
but
the
desire
for
a
wife
and
a
home
and
love
and
now
that
it
all
seemed
to
slip
through
his
fingers
he
was
seized
with
despair
he
wanted
all
that
more
than
anything
in
the
world
what
did
he
care
for
spain
and
its
cities
cordova
toledo
leon
what
to
him
were
the
pagodas
of
burmah
and
the
lagoons
of
south
sea
islands
america
was
here
and
now
it
seemed
to
him
that
all
his
life
he
had
followed
the
ideals
that
other
people
by
their
words
or
their
writings
had
instilled
into
him
and
never
the
desires
of
his
own
heart
always
his
course
had
been
swayed
by
what
he
thought
he
should
do
and
never
by
what
he
wanted
with
his
whole
soul
to
do
he
put
all
that
aside
now
with
a
gesture
of
impatience
he
had
lived
always
in
the
future
and
the
present
always
always
had
slipped
through
his
fingers
his
ideals
he
thought
of
his
desire
to
make
a
design
intricate
and
beautiful
out
of
the
myriad
meaningless
facts
of
life
had
he
not
seen
also
that
the
simplest
pattern
that
in
which
a
man
was
born
worked
married
had
children
and
died
was
likewise
the
most
perfect
it
might
be
that
to
surrender
to
happiness
was
to
accept
defeat
but
it
was
a
defeat
better
than
many
victories
he
glanced
quickly
at
sally
he
wondered
what
she
was
thinking
and
then
looked
away
again
i
was
going
to
ask
you
to
marry
me
he
said
i
thought
praps
you
might
but
i
shouldnt
have
liked
to
stand
in
your
way
you
wouldnt
have
done
that
how
about
your
travels

you
and
dad
talk
about
it
till
you
were
blue
in
the
face
i
dont
care
a
damn
about
all
that
he
paused
for
an
instant
and
then
spoke
in
a
low
hoarse
whisper
i
dont
want
to
leave
you
i
cant
leave
you
she
did
not
answer
he
could
not
tell
what
she
thought
i
wonder
if
youll
marry
me
sally
she
did
not
move
and
there
was
no
flicker
of
emotion
on
her
face
but
she
did
not
look
at
him
when
she
answered
if
you
like
dont
you
want
to
oh
of
course
id
like
to
have
a
house
of
my
own
and
its
about
time
i
was
settling
down
he
smiled
a
little
he
knew
her
pretty
well
by
now
and
her
manner
did
not
surprise
him
but
dont
you
want
to
marry
me

dad

surprised

so
happy

lunch
she
said
dear
he
smiled
and
took
her
hand
and
pressed
it
they
got
up
and
walked
out
of
the
gallery
they
stood
for
a
moment
at
the
balustrade
and
looked
at
trafalgar
square
cabs
and
omnibuses
hurried
to
and
fro
and
crowds
passed
hastening
in
every
direction
and
the
sun
was
shining
